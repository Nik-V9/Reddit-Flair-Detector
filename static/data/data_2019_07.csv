And their Pizza smells like shit to me. And they have more cancer patients compare to Indians (5th place in the whole world)

I know KFC is not even hygienic, Saw many controversies and some of their branches are banned in India.

He wasn't best indian team captain but he was captain of best Indian team(at WC winning).He got great cult following who are blind to see anything that looks bad on him so because of that Media sings his great endeavour all Time because criticism him would be bad for business. This why he got so strong in board that he basically do whatever the fuck he likes (you can't ignore some of the team selection which are done after 2011, *Gambhir*). He basically IS team selector and nobody wants to say anything because he is too powerful. Everybody is on his side in board. His performance is shit in last  two years(i think he should have retired somewhere around 2017)but still he makes every single cut. His performance in world cup 2019 is shit but nobody speaking anything because he may retire after worldcup and why risk it all to make a point and become target of internet mob(kudos to Sachin for criticizing him) 

He is gotten to a point where will do anything and get a free pass( just imagine any player doing that tantrums which dhoni  did in IPL when he was losing)

Everybody keep saying that he is so cool but it's rather contrary he basically just don't give a shit. Look at any other captain after losing important match you will find similarly but Dhoni's case you won't. 

It is basically every aspect of his career he do anything that doesn't look good on him people will turn it into a his skill ( i have literally seen video where some people dubbed his voice so it look like he isn't swearing at Manish Pandey ( i get it . people swear all the time and things get competitive in sports, but why sugar coat it to make him larger than life character)


He is great wicket keeper and has a good track record untill 2016. But i think power got in his head.

He basically IS team selector and nobody wants to say anything because he is too powerful. Everybody is on his side in board. His performance is shit in last  two years(i think he should have retired somewhere around 2017)but still he makes every single cut. His performance in world cup 2019 is shit but nobody speaking anything because he may retire after worldcup and why risk it all to make a point and become target of internet mob(kudos to Sachin for criticizing him) 

He is gotten to a point where will do anything and get a free pass( just imagine any player doing that tantrums which dhoni  did in IPL when he was losing)

Everybody keep saying that he is so cool but it's rather contrary he basically just don't give a shit. Look at any other captain after losing important match you will find similarly but Dhoni's case you won't. 

It is basically every aspect of his career he do anything that doesn't look good on him people will turn it into a his skill ( i have literally seen video where some people dubbed his voice so it look like he isn't swearing at Manish Pandey ( i get it . people swear all the time and things get competitive in sports, but why sugar coat it to make him larger than life character)


He is great wicket keeper and has a good track record untill 2016. But i think power got in his head.


[I think many people downvote and report this and those persons are also who tweets that ""why media is not asking Narendra Modi questions? PM he bhagavan nai""  just think twice about situation that all I'm asking]

1563200876,king_bardock,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cdi4nc/old_players_i_was_remembering_in_this_wc_19/,1,12,,,Old Players I was remembering in this WC 19.,"In this world Cup, England become Champion first time ever since England is one who give birth to this game and they never won any World Cup Trophies. 

As every Indian Fan is sad about India get lose and Eliminated in Semi Final against New Zealand. 

But in this world cup I was Remembering some old players and imagining what If they were part of Current Team. 

##OLD MS DHONI. 

As everyone beloved Dhoni who maybe didn't bat at level fan expected but his contribution in planning making, experience and managing play big factor for India Qualify for Semi Final. 

But at some moments I was missing that Old 2011-14 Finisher Dhoni and 2000 Aggressive Dhoni and one of the moment was India match with England. When Dhoni come to Bat team needed Runs with run rate of almost 10 but surprisingly he leave First ball he faced. And even in Aadil Rashid over in which It was Expected that Dhoni will free his arms only get 5 runs in that Over. And he even stopped Pandya from hitting shorts who was making quick runs before Dhoni Come to play and they were not even trying to play any big shorts. 

That moment I was Imagining if It was Dhoni from 2011-14, even he plays some slow game but he definitely starts play big shorts in last 5-6 overs and match would be little closer. Or If It was 2000 Dhoni who is purely aggressive and hard hitter, combination of aggression of Pandya and 2000 Dhoni would definitely bring match close and possibly even ensure India Victory. 

##Rahul Dravid. 

Seriously we never got any alternate of ""Wall"" yet in current Team. We even got alternate of Sachin, we got better bowling attack, better Opening Pair, but we never got Alternate of Dravid. **When we need Opener, Dravid is there. we need finisher,  Dravid is there. We need any player who can stabilize innings, Dravid is there, when 4th day is in trouble, Dravid is there.** Complete package of Batsman was Dravid. 

In India Vs New Zealand Semi Final, India lost top 3 batsman just under score of 10 and 6 wickets just under score of 100. But Thanks to Jadeja and Dhoni who atleast prevent Shameful lose of India. 

But I was Imagining what If Dravid was playing this match. Seriously this guy is most Sensible, Reliable and trustable Batsman India ever got. If he was in this match then Dravid potentially could stabilize innings when Team was losing wickets and keep one side secure. 

Dravid is One I am missing most in Current Team India and It is sad to see we cannot replace him. ����������",cdi4nc,,false,/r/india/comments/cdi4nc/old_players_i_was_remembering_in_this_wc_19/,Sports

- Dhoni doesn't retire post WC, this raises a lot of eyebrows - obviously he is 38, there are better replacements and this is the time to try out new players

- Statement from Rhiti Sports(Dhoni owned and manages him and other CsK) and later on selection panel that Dhoni would not be retiring and rather doing a 2 month stint with the army. Lot of people are surprised by this and don't understand the timing of this post WC.

- In the immediate few days after this,  Audit report of Amrapali group is analysed as part of SC case against the group. Audit trail shows a clear nexus between group and Rhiti Sports, where homebuyers's money has been siphoned off to his wife, Sports Agency and now news even linking the bcci head Shashank Manohar (What??)

- [Side Event] Byjus announced as new jersey sponsor replacing Oppo. No Tender or process for jersey sponsor had been allowed, but just an announcement of Byjus (of all companies) to be jersey sponsor for BCCI. 

## Conclusion

- If you read between the lines, this was a well timed move by Sports Agency or Dhoni to announce the Army stint before the Amrapali Sham comes out to the media. Also most likely the reason for not retiring so can still call a few shots if this goes south (refer to the ipl fixing issue). How far is the bcci involved is anyone's guess with their shady crony practices? 

- Just another thing to bring home the point is none of the other Indian player greats including Sachin, Yuvraj, Sehwag, Clean as hell Dravid, Ganguly have over courted as many controversies as Dhoni. The clout that Dhoni holds is enough for him to walk on to the pitch in IPL even if he was not the fielding team, nor batting and get away with 50% fee fine, that should tell you how muddy our cricket world is (Byjus and all the above). 

- Meanwhile the match starts on Aug3 and we all go India...India with ads of Dream 11 and Godaddy after every over, khelo dimag se my friends",chze6i,,false,/r/india/comments/chze6i/timing_of_dhonis_stint_with_the_army_and_amrapali/,Sports

I see that good marketing usually -----&gt;(drives) more fans,  patriotism, and popularity. 

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, I came across Parth Sabnis' concept page and was impressed with these kit designs, especially INDIA. [https://www.artstation.com/artwork/qB9YN](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/qB9YN)

&amp;#x200B;

Is there a reason we won't consider rebranding? Feel free for critiques!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Another question: There has been talk about the transition to an actual dual citizenship for India. Do you think the AIFF would consider and invite overseas young talent like Joshua Pynadath, Yan Dhanda, etc. who claim their Indian ethnicity?

After 2-3 hours , a prospective buyer showed interest and said that he will buy it but payment he will do online by UPI. When I insisted for Paytm ,he refused and said that he will do by Google pay / phone pe.

There were several red signals like 
1. He didn't bargain                                            
2. He was ready to take delivery on his own.       
3. He insisted that he needed QR screenshot as he will do it by computer. So giving mobile number won't work.

Sensing something fishy, I send him a screenshot on whatsapp  of my wife Google pay QR code  as that account has only minimal balance ., practically nothing
( Even though I used digital wallets, but I am not very pro as I only use for paying electricity, insurance ,recharge bills )

Immediately , he called and said that he will first send 5rs to check if balance has been recieved by me or not and then  he will send the rest of the money.

So ,with my wife Mobile in hand ,I was online with this guy , in between I asked that is he from Jharkhand (most of banking scammers are from a particular town in Jharkhand ); he replied yes. 
I questioned that how can he take delivery of a furniture from Mumbai if he is from Jharkhand ,then he said that he is from army and it is for his family in Mumbai; he send me screenshots of a Canteen smart card along with some army ID .
Then he said that he is sending me 5rs ; he then guided me to check my balance in all transactions . When I checked then I noticed that it is showing -5rs and the name was a muslim name not the one which is mentioned in Truecaller and that CSD Id screenshot .

He then told me to accept that request , i replied that according to that transaction it is me who is sending that amount ,not the other way around. 
He then replied that sir you just send me 5rs , once I recieved and the verification is done then I will send the remaining. ( 13000rs(
I told that verification is already done and it is time for you to pay the amount .
Then he just disconnected the line , and since yesterday he is not picking up calls 

In this entire fiasco, I didn't lose a penny ,but can someone enlighten that what this scam is all about ??? What would have happened if I have send him that 5rs.???",cfhgmt,,false,/r/india/comments/cfhgmt/is_this_some_new_online_olx_scam/,AskIndia

Is there any forum / platform for stressed out RE Investors (or any other group of distressed customers) where they can get together and possibly plan out a Class Action Lawsuit? ( [https://www.obhanandassociates.com/blog/class-action-suits-in-india/?utm\_source=Mondaq&amp;utm\_medium=syndication&amp;utm\_campaign=View-Original](https://www.obhanandassociates.com/blog/class-action-suits-in-india/?utm_source=Mondaq&amp;utm_medium=syndication&amp;utm_campaign=View-Original) )

Most, if not all, RE Developers have been notorious for raising money for project X and then putting that money in use for project Y, while delaying and eventually stopping the 'Reassured Return' payments that they had originally promised. Moreover, developers have indirectly forced RE Investors, who often do not have any other rational choice, to accept changes in the original agreements of the investment. These changes always mean a loss to the investor and a convenient gain for the developer.

Because of high litigation costs and all the other headaches associated with litigation, one particular investor often does not possess the time and patience to fight against these asshole companies. More often than not the developers get away with their bullshit. The ones who have the courage to protest are only met with employees at the lowest level.

I can't seem to find a platform where investors in a particular project can get together and discuss further plans of action. There's GOT to be one! And if there is'nt one then how can one approach to connect with other investors in the same project?

Please feel free to reach out /comment if you can relate to this post / know of someone who might.

Looking forward to pick some brains in this community.

TL;DR: RE developers are major arseholes. Looking for a platform / forum where RE investors of a particular project can connect with each other and plan out Class Action Lawsuits.

My sincere apologies to those who are getting sick of people like me who are dumping their sob stories here in hopes that someone will notice them. And they'll help us escape this rut. 

Why? 

Because we can somehow get a post together and complain about our problems ... so  our ""spoken English"" is good enough and we're definitely qualified to write articles about AI or Blockchain, just by doing ""research"" on Google. 

We couldn't save ourselves by going to college and/or are social shut-ins ... so if someone helps us by communicating and supporting ( READ: giving us free moniez ) we can definitely change our lives by becoming the next big programmer.... totally possible right?

.....

The purpose of this rant is to ask the startup and small business owners who have successfully hired a dropout or a desperate job seeker, if any. 

So, I am planning on self-learning python ( started once, slacked off, going to try again ) but to survive and move to a city, I need some side income. 

The only thing I can do right now is write content but most content writing jobs in India require a bachelors. How do I even stand a chance when I am 25 and most people my age have M.sc/M.techs or MBAs? 

* What can I do to build a portfolio? 
* Where can I network with people without going to college?
* Also, obligatory... how to stay disciplined?

I need some advice in an apartment related matter.

We moved into this apartment a little less than 2 years and signed a 2 years lease.
Now that the 2 years are almost up, the landlord wants to sell this house. 

We're not interested in buying so he's sending potential buyers along with brokers to a point where there's 4-5 parties showing up in a single day. And all this is happening without Notice, without even calling and giving us a heads up.

My question is this, are we within our legal rights to deny these people from coming and checking out the apartment throughout the day, for as long as we're here? I am not sure what the lease agreements says yet so I'll have to check but is it within my legal rights to stop this from happening and bring it up with my landlord?

I admit that this landlord wants to get started early on selling this apartment but this is causing us a lot of inconvenience.",cfobzb,,false,/r/india/comments/cfobzb/need_advice_apartment_related/,AskIndia

I would share my situation. I started as a Software Developer a few years back and since then I have progressed to a Senior position and now working abroad,  although most people in the department are still Indians. The job pays great and I'm sure many people would be aiming to get such salaries. But despite that, I find my work dull and boring and increasingly so. 

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, I realize that Tech isn't something that I'm passionate about. I am good at it or I would say decent but I don't have any thirst for new knowledge or care at all what Elon Musk is doing, and how Uber handles their backend. These things just don't interest me at all. And for this reason, I find it difficult to connect with coworkers or others in the field. People add me on WhatsApp groups where they discuss tech and share tech related articles. Sometimes even their jokes are related to tech or server errors. I don't find fun in this at all. 

&amp;#x200B;

I find most of this very abstract and I think this doesn't provide any fulfillment to me. Obviously, I can't leave it since it pays very well and I don't have any other skills that would pay that much. But I just don't like going to the office or hanging out with most people since inside my head I am thinking about completely different things. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now we all know this is too costly for a middle-class person but there's some good news! 
With major companies such as Suzuki announcing that they would stop production of diesel-powered cars starting next year. Moreover, the percentage of people buying both petrol and diesel cars have reduced dramatically. So basically companies such as Hyundai, fiat, Mahindra, Renault, Suzuki have a huge stockpile of cars unsold. Now with rising fuel prices and adding the maintenance costs, people are choosing not to buy a car and are instead using services such us Uber, ola. The government are also offering incentives and are reducing the tax on electric vehicles. (People can refer to the recent budget and see the tax benefit, interest rates on loan for EV vehicles )

Here are a couple of things I would like to see the government implement for the growth of EV cars.

1-charging stations across the country equipped with fast charging so that people traveling to far away places face no worry. 
2-battery production to be done in India on a major scale so the price of the car comes down.

Lastly, I hope all the major car manufacturers understand that electric cars are the future and start manufacturing some decent electric cars with good range, looks and keep a competitive price.

**tl;dr:** I'm a 26 y/o CA IPCC and B.Com graduate with 3 years of Articleship (internship), 1 year of Indirect Tax experience in the Big 4 and 1 year in Accounting. I'm currently in a dead-end Accounting job in a Fortune 500 company and desperately want to pivot to another role. Having not cleared CA Final and not having experience in anything truly related to corporate finance, how can I correct my career path and build my life back? I'm desperate and any advice would be incredibly helpful.

**Background:**

I apologize if this is yet another monotonous post here. But I truly am in desperate need of advice at this juncture of my life having been utterly depressed due to the outcomes of my mistakes over the past 5 years.

To give a brief background about myself, I was always a good student ever since I was a kid. I almost always got 85-90% in CBSE throughout my schooling. Inspite of being in the science stream until my 12th, I chose to pursue Chartered Accountancy and cleared the first two steps (CPT and IPCC) with flying colours in the first attempt. I then started doing my Articleship (internship), 3 years of which is mandated in the CA course, in one of the most reputed firms in my city, And this is the point of time where my career's downfall has started due to my utter negligence, recklessness and laziness.

I was considered to be one of the brightest in the lot in the firm and assigned to the biggest of the clients. Usually, the first year of the three year articleship usually consists of pretty simple work. The other two years are where a person truly learns about the nuances of Auditing. Coming back to my story, around the time of completion of my first year, due to some differences with my Manager, which in hindsight seem to be very petty, I put down my papers. Out of sheer desperation, I joined a firm which was just set up. Only after I joined did I realize that there were hardly any assignments there. No stat audit, no internal audit, no tax audit, nothing. Just a few certifications here and there. Having just quit a firm, I coudn't quit here too due to the stringent regulations by ICAI, the regulatory body for CA's. So I spent the rest of the 2 years completing my Articleship having learnt pretty much nothing work-wise.

Then came the time for my CA Final Exams. I still do not know what happened to me but I just coudn't study. I was at Home for 6 months to prepare. But literally studied for only a handful of weeks. It's not that I didn't try. For the entire 6 months, I was stuck in my house in front of the books from morning to night. But I could just not read for longer than 30 minutes. This obviously resulted in me flunking the Exams. I tried to study for 6 more months and write again. The same exact story repeated all over again.

This is when my boss from my Articleship firm called me and offered me a job in the Big-4 company that he just joined as a Director. However the role was purely into Indirect Taxation. During the period that I worked there, I did really well work-wise. But the 2 attempts for CA Final that I gave during that period were also doomed as I hardly got any time to Study. So I worked there for exactly an year and quit to focus on my studies and clear CA.

This time I thought that I would not repeat my earlier mistakes. So I enrolled in a library and went there religiously for one more year and attempted the Exams two more times. Nada. I just couldn't study yet again. It is not that my mental capabilities degraded. I tried studying for a few other courses in the interim for a week or so to see if that would interest me. and they did. I could properly study them and ace the tests. But when I sat in front of my CA books again, my mind tried everything possible to divert me from that.

Having been jobless for over an year now and not clearing CA too, I became extremely depressed and lost all hopes on myself. My self-confidence was at it's lowest and there was hardly a smile on my face for a long time. I then started looking for jobs and got a role as a Financial Accountant in a different city in a Fortune 500 IT product based company which I accepted out of desperation. It has been 6 months since I joined and I am having no job satisfaction whatsoever.

This is not what I want to do for the rest of my life. I do not want to be stuck in Accounting. It is just not for me. It is a routine operational role which can easily be automated in a year or so. But on the other hand, I still am not able to study for CA Final. It is just not happening. I turned 26 a few months ago and it is really worrying me. The worst part is that I don't know what else to do. There are so many thing in my head but I have no confidence left in me and do not know what to do. I could do CFA or CPA or do well in GMAT and do Masters abroad by taking a loan. But first of all, I want to work in a role that interests me and takes my career forward like FP&amp;A, corporate finance, valuation, M&amp;A, investment banking and transaction advisory. But i'm a 26 y/o with CA IPCC and B.Com as qualifications and 1 year experience in the Big 4 in Indirect Taxation and then 6 months and running in an accounting role now. Is there really a way for me to get into any of them?

What is the ideal way forward for me? Can I really improve my life now? I have absolutely no clue and this is keeping me awake every night. Any advices or suggestions would mean a lot and be truly appreciated.",ca89gq,,false,/r/india/comments/ca89gq/career_advice_needed_26_yo_in_a_dead_end/,AskIndia

I'm puzzled between going to Rishikesh, or Goa for my yoga training.? Any recommandations? I heard the weather is bad at that time of the year. Is it that bad? Anywhere else to recommend?

I'm also landing in Delhi and possibly staying there for a few days. What's there to do in Delhi? Is there a cool bar/ club scene?

I'm a 22 year old south Indian woman. I have just finished my U.G, and I'm not ready for marriage. I recently found out my parents have been sending pictures of my Astrological chart (Khundali or Jatagam) to marriage brokers and I even suspect my dad took a photo of mine and gave to some marriage broker in my village. I have previously told my parents very seriously that i will never marry and even if I ever did He will never be of our community (narrow gene pool) they have agreed to it and promised me nothing would be done without my permission. I still want to study, work and travel the world (i know  cliché). And when it comes to marriage i will only do it after dating  and I want the marriage ceremony to be done in a temple without wasting money and creating a scene. I know legally no one can force me into marriage but I feel betrayed, sad and isolated, I trusted my parents now I feel like they don't prioritize my happiness. I can never envision myself living a life like most girls in my community (marrying an older guy who is a far cousin and basically serving him and his family and giving birth until they get a son). I still depend on my parents for money for my further studies abroad so I can't fully cut them out. What do I do now should i confront them which will lead to a huge argument or should i just stay quite and go on with life. I know this post is a huge mess and way to long but i have no one to talk to about this and my friends find it weird and baffling about how I plan to live and obviously they don't understand how i feel. Please give me any advise on how i should react to this and let me know if you are someone like me so i could finally have a friend who understands .

There are multiple business centres and residential societies in Gurgaon that ask for Govenment IDs for visitors. Is this strictly legal? Because according to my limited knowledge, private entities aren't allowed to make showing government IDs mandatory as per the Fundamental Right to Privacy judgement. 

Also, it's not like I'm asking for doing away with all identification (though that'd be a cherry on the cake), showing a company ID or a business card should suffice. Especially as most of these societies also collect phone numbers to send visitors an OTP. I would very much not like to give over my govt ID (voter card, aadhaar, PAN) to a private entity, if I can help it.

She said she handed him a 100 rupee note (for 9 rupee fare) but he only returned her the change for 10.

Immediately, the other passengers chimed in support of the girl (she was wearing some school uniform). But no one really was looking when the actual exchange happened. The other bus conductor vehemently supported his colleague's version of the story. As did the girl for her own.

She was sitting behind me so I also didn't see anything, as I was standing facing the head of a man facing the window (don't ask).

I don't know who is the liar or who simply forgot to pay atttention. In the end the girl did not get her money back.

When you think about it, cash -- being a bearer instrument, is kinda flawed when there are no cameras around. If I think about it, something like this has happened to me also. I paid someone cash but it never registered in their memory. But I got back what was mine. And that's because I was ready to fight to the death for a pittance. Humanity and straight explanation doesn't fly where I live.

In your state, do bus conductors do this thing were they take large note from passenger, and then run to the gate in order to beckon other passengers, and then come back to give the change?

I asked my opthamologist but he asked for a Corneal Topography test costing Rs 2,000 to see if I can get a Lasik.

Before I get this test, can someone tell me if there is any procedure to live without glasses without any post procedure complications like dry eye, blurry vision, poor vision, power increasing after surgery etc?

I checked a thread on Lasik  that was 2 year old. But I think a lot new procedures have developed in past 2 years in which burning of cornea or creating a flap is not necessary. Maybe its called SMILE. Is it true?

Hey folks,

I can't find a lot of good websites that guide me around things like how to manage my finance, what are the formalities required for managing taxes, expenses and income etc in India.. I have been working as a full time engineer since I'm 18 (now I'm 19) and fortunately or unfortunately I have to pay taxes as I am earning above the tax-exempt bracket. It's really hard to figure out everything to be done without a proper guide or so from either the govt or someone I trust. From what I see I have to pay taxes for my last year too so rip and I still haven't really figured out how to get these things done. Fortunately my meetings with my bank manager have been fruitful in that I managed to get creditcard without filing my income and tax stuff (possible in some circumstances). My problem now is that I don't really know what needs to be done (in terms of official documentation) after I start earning? (Maybe this is something I should have figured out last year) 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a few things I know I should be doing but I don't know how:

\- File my annual income

\- Pay my taxes. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anything else that I need to be worrying about?

As the title suggests, I need some help related to some stuff I’ve been dealing with lately. I’d seen people getting genuine advices and suggestions from fellow redditors on various occasions and tonight I’d really appreciate if I could get some friendly advice from you guys. Sorry as this may end being a long post.

I dropped out of college in 2013, been working since and was doing good I’d say, until July 2016, when fiancé lost her Mum, later that week I got diagnosed with BPD 1, but being a stigma that mental ailment/illness is or was in my POV at that time, never got around discussing it my partner or parents. I was even prescribed medication in my later sessions, which I followed for a while but gave it up as I felt no difference whatsoever. 

September 2017, after 3 decades of their marriage, folks decided to part ways. I tried whatever I can, however I can but to no avail. Finally gave up, came back to Pune again, and got a new job, started with my life but all this while this took a silent toll on me, which I realized a bit too late. By this time, I started having serious trouble in sleeping, concentrating, and severe weight loss just to name a few.

November 2018, had a panic attack for the first time, twas my birthday that night. :( Never wanted anyone to know my condition, let alone see me in that state. Ultimately decided to quit my job, took a sabbatical and went to Assam as a volunteer, which helped me somehow so ended up staying there for over a month. I started to feel okay at that time and decided to return to my hometown for few days before getting a new job, to meet parents and try to reconcile them; how naïve was I!

(All this while, I had some peace in knowing that the Muse I found in her, would be there when I go down) 

January 2019, returned home. Had great plans for the year ahead but everything was just about to take a turn for worse. My fiancé came to visit a couple days later when she told me about her new job in Delhi, I was content with the fact that she’s doing the best she can. TBH, I didn’t want her to leave cause when she was there, I felt I was home and no harm could come to me. 

March 2019, her birthday. Planned everything, went to see her, only to be told that she won’t want to meet me, never in my life had I felt so lost, numb and miserable. Somehow called a mate to pick me up, went to his place, got drunk and passed out. Next morning she calls to meet up, and being blind in love, went to see her. Now she tells me, she has been staying at her Ex-boyfriend’s place; and that WE aren’t anymore and gave me back the “Ring” and asked me to leave. Had another panic attack and immediately booked next flight home.

March-June 2019, I didn’t know what I was doing, twice again I had panic attacks, always felt nauseated and would throw up frequently. Stopped home-tutoring as well. Gave up drinking, but something would always be amiss. Also got tired of bouncing between my folks place so often. Getting tired of everything at home, I finally decided it was time to deal with it, so relocated to Gurgaon, in search of a job in June End.

But tonight, I am hopeless and feel like dying. Nothing seems to make any sense, everything I do, clouds my judgement even more. Gave a couple of interviews, only to be rejected by all them. My dad’s home, sick and unable to go to work, same goes for mum, although my sister is with her. I, as a son, tonight, feel the pressure of failures mounting on me. I know I’m not doing my best, but I’m trying as hard as I can. I feel like I’m losing this battle without even having a chance to fight in it. Why of everyone, my life turned out be like this? I always cared for everyone, tried doing whatever I could for my loved ones, but still the question lingers WHY?

I hope I’m not judged/ridiculed by this post, and I don’t exactly know what I should ask you guys, but what did you do when you felt your whole world is crashing apart, people you live for, have left you already? How do you come face-to-face with reality, cause I for one have lied enough to myself that everything will be alright, when everything seems going south! Should I again start consulting a psychiatrist, if yes can you please make a suggestion, and if no, what would you recommend? Has anyone been diagnosed with similar kind of disorder or any other for that matter? What helps you and keeps you motivated when you’re losing on your will and self-confidence? 

I was suggested Vipassana by many of whom are aware of my condition, so I checked dhamma.org; but they mentioned on their website that people with psychiatric conditions shouldn’t opt for Vipassana, any feedback on this? Anyone who took the course and found it not worth it, please share your experiences.

I see in her eyes every night, the world that was ours! The night when we met, is still as fresh as a new born lily. This perpetual feeling of “feeling for someone”; although sweet, doesn’t spare you the scars when it goes unrequited. I’m a person who values small things rather than big fucking bears, I still remember dates with exact time, you get my wind. 

That hug at Metro station the day I reached GGN, is one moment that has kept alive, else seeing everything what I’m seeing, this vague thought of ending everything once and for all now seems never so far! I know I’m being stupid but I’m being what I’m, a guy who is still in love(read blindly), and I want her back, not physically, but from where we connected, from where she created and then connected the dots. 

She sarcastically said once, you didn’t write anything for me since the day I left, and I being a Lodu, couldn’t show her what I wrote, couldn’t explain her that since she has left, ive stopped thinking, comprehending things, let alone write a single word. I literally sat there for 3 months and looked at the wall; after which I went to places near my city, places I wanted her to with me, places where I could just hold her hand and kiss her on her ear(ha-ha) and could tell her that what she means to me. Dreams come true, don’t they? Else the mere existence of humanity would cease to exist.

What a man has to lose when he’s 27! His life, his existence, his family or the woman he thought he’ll lead his life with?!!

FWIW, the riffs in those eyes wont let me sleep. Is it evident enough that I still feel for her? Why the fuck am I like this, I remember saying this to my dad, being practical is the solution for most of our miseries, but tonight when she isn’t here, when I just cant hold her for THAT one second, I bleed; profusely, through tears and blood, stains of which she never cant find! I wasn’t this, I used to tell her eberything, literally, and when tonight this night is actually blanketing me, I’m still here trying to figure out one singke way out, and also one single way back in; to her heart! For a man is made of two things; the words he once said and the love he then lost!!

Nothings paused, not even this breathing of mine, not this fuckall heart of mine, yet everything that was mine, has already stopped being mine! It hurts, it fucking hurts, and it hurts even more when she reacts the way she does! Am I no one that am treated this way?

I did something naïve; and I know I’m now screwed eternally. When I met her later that evening, we ended up getting an apartment ‘together’. It was miscommunication and misunderstanding of certain facts that led to this, 2 weeks later; TODAY. She asked me when I’m going to find a new apartment. Yes, she actually thought that this apartment (which comes with sooommmeee investment), is hers and am going to get a new one apparently. Haan galti sabse hoti hain! Since her new job which is only a month old, she was staying at her friend’s but that friend was relocating to Gujarat, blimey, the girl won’t have a place to stay and I was not going to let that happen, not on my watch.

How and I can’t stress this enough, how can I get out of this mess that I’m stuck in, now am out of cash, unable to get a job my motivation is more screwed up than when I came here, and the worst part is she sees me like this, only to shrug away coldly, every time. Holding her hand while sleeping, I feel the warmth again, I want to be where I was and not where I am! I couldn’t share this with anyone else whom I know in person that’s why tonight I need your help, your suggestions, anything that might be able to help me. 

Moving on, this is a pretty serious affair. Since I’m a dropout, ive been working in BPO’s, but started with my graduation last year, B.Com from IGNOU. I’m now JLPT (Japanese Language Proficiency Test)) N5 level (N5 being the easiest, N1 being the toughest) and would be appearing for N4 this December. I’d like to know, what skills/diplomas/certifications can I pursue in order to improve the trajectory of my career because at the end of the day, whatever experience I have on papers doesn’t count for anything. I was a B.Tech Chemical Engineering student, but that wasn’t my cup of tea. Any suggestions related would be gratefully appreciated. 

If you came down till here, just know that I feel indebted to you that you took the time to read all of it which means a lot to me rn. I would like to say that this post took a whole lot of courage and over 2 months to post it on this sub, and am hopeful that I’ll get some good suggestions.

I posted here before and had good success. You guys have been very helpful throughout this process. My brother and I are setting up a satellite office in India for our web development/SEO/marketing needs.

We are currently trying to navigate through the rigorous employment laws. All the resources seem to be convoluted and many are out of date. Anyone have a good link we can read through? These are the questions we are trying to answer:

* Max hours of work per week?
* Max hours of work in a day?
* Overtime eligibility? Is there a higher rate given?
* Paid holidays to give are 3, Any more specific to different regions?
* Any unpaid holidays we are required to give?
* Any additional pay required such as 13/14 month, bonus, etc?
* Is paid vacation/sick leave mandated?
* Any mandates for probationary period? 
* Trainings required to provide (i.e. sexual harassment at the work place)?
* Healthcare requirements?
* Are there contracts established? If so is there a good source for a sample contract?
* Illegal questions we cannot ask during an interview, for example in the US we cannot ask a candidates age and a lot more.
* What else are we missing that we may have missed or is a unique law to India?

Furthermore are there any ""nice to have"" qualities employers offer in India to assist in the recruiting process. We are thinking along the lines of (based on years of service):

* Additional rotating paid Indian holidays
* Additional paid vacation leave
* End of year bonus/commissions
* Equity/partner buy in after a few years of service


As a side note, if you are interested in applying and are skilled as a full stack web developer or managing SEO/PPC/CRM campaigns, send a PM and I will provide you with the Skype to send over a resume and interview.

Would you ever like to see them do an India-based character, or do you think it better if they don't?","I ask this - because at least China has one export that is universal and that doesn't require cultural understanding: martial arts.  Since it's a universal and technical art, and action is understood by any culture, it's easily adopted by the west (hence Bruce Lee).  

But India doesn't really have such a universal export: almost all our films are rooted in our culture and one has to be able to understand/interpret our Indian dialogue and social intricacies to get them.  That goes even for 'universal' themes like love/romance or action.  This is why most Bollywood films aren't readily watched by westerners unless they are already specially interested in Indian culture.  The very way the films are shot, edited, etc reflect a difference in mindset.

The only thing I can potentially see Marvel adopting is a Yogi, maybe some monk or sadhu who has special powers - but then again they already have Dr. Strange who is in charge of the mystic arts and has a oriental/tibetan lineage in Wong.  

So I think if they can't really get a useful character from India, without reducing him to a stereotype or caricature, it may be better that they don't use an Indian/South Asian character.  Besides, I believe they did the Shang Chi movie to largely tap the Chinese movie market, which is huge for them money-wise.  India has a big market too, but not as big as China and so they may not think about investing a character just for that purpose.  

Still, for me it would be really nice to see an Indian character done right and with justice on such a world stage, to be seen as powerful instead of side-stepped; too often we get overlooked in that way.",cfvqx0,,false,/r/india/comments/cfvqx0/marvel_just_announced_an_upcoming_movie_shang_chi/,AskIndia

I got into a car accident yesterday because my foot slipped on the brake and I ended up pressing on it harder than usual, causing my car to come to an immediate stop. A car coming from behind crashed into my car, taking out the taillight and causing damage to the bumper.

Now the guy who rear-ended me got mad and I apologised and (stupidly, in hind sight) agreed that it was my fault. There was a third lady who hit his bumper and I believe the guy behind me got her contact details.

So I went to the workshop yesterday itself and got all the damage covered under my insurance (except for a few things which I'll be paying for). This guy didn't call me yesterday except to inform me that he's taking his car to the workshop.

He called me up about an hour back, telling me that the estimate for the damages will be 45-50k. Dude isn't claiming the insurance apparently and, I quote, ""there's some issue with it"". He's also expressed that he's not interested in bringing the matter to the police. 

I am not very familiar with legal/insurance speak, but this reeks of bullshit to me. What are my options in this case?

Advice would be much appreciated.

EDIT: Will be filing an FIR and let the insurance handle this. Better to handle it through the proper legal channels instead of off the books since I'm most likely being screwed with otherwise.

I was driving near my house with a Learner's license. There was a L on the car but no one was accompanying me. I was alone.

I wanted to exit from the main lane to service lane in the opposite direction. I entered the service lane. This guy on his Activa was speeding really close to the exit, He had to hard brake and ended up hitting my car. 

Diagram - http://imgur.com/gallery/LYMnb5Y

No one was injured but his Activa got some major dent. 
It was my mistake to some extent. I should have 'waited' with my car's ass on the highway to enter the service lane. And it was his mistake too in my opinion as you must not be speeding like that near a highway exit to service lane.

There was hardly any scratch on my car. He started yelling at me and wanted me to pay for his damage for his dent.

I told him to claim insurance. He said 'I don't have my bike insured' and threatened me to get police involved. I told him he is free to do whatever he wants. There were 8-10 traffic police guys catching 2 wheelers for helmet 20-30m away from us. So I took my car there and he approached one traffic police there.

The traffic police guy walked up to my window and asked whether I have a license and papers I said 'Yes'.

Then the traffic police told us 'You two get this sorted amongst yourself, I dare you to not come inside the police station' (There was a police station few metres away). And he walked away catching 2 wheelers riding without helmet as usual.

Now this guy with a Pikachu face tried to intimidate me that *'Tujhe jaane nahi duga, ye karuga vo karuga bla bla'*

So I got down from my car and told him to control his tongue and talked in regional language and told that I am a local in this village to 'assert dominance' (He was an outsider). 

I told him that he is free to do whatever he wants and that it is illegal to drive on road without having a valid insurance policy. 

Then I sat into my car and drove away as he was being passive aggressive and saying 'Mera nuksan ho gaya' etc. He did not chase me.

**Story over**

Now can someone please tell me what is a person supposed to do when involved in an accident if

Case 1: I am not at fault

Case 2: I am at fault

Case 3: He is at fault

Case 4: Both are not at fault

Case 5: Someone dies

From my primary and initial understanding, this is a lot different from Credit agencies or credit agencies. 

I don't understand the purpose of Information Utilities or gathering all the financial data into a pool. May be, people who have their debts and credits authenticated by NeSL may be considered credible and be given loans at lesser interests in future?

Also, looking further into NeSL website, I see that they charge a fee to store their data.

I don't yet see advantages for individual as such but for Finance Professionals, I guess it is a huge opportunity to get data to build credit derivatives and pools based on available credit data.(if this data is publicly available which I think it is. )

To start with, I am a CS undergrad at one of the better state level institutes in Maharashtra. Finished my second year. Starting my third year i.e the junior year.

As you can understand, the idea that I have is quite vague.

The core of the matter is simply this - I want to find ways of applying computer science to design.

To add to the question, could anyone tell me what is the usual eligibility criteria for NID/IIT-B types for masters?

This post is about the problems faced by tenants after moving into a a new accommodation in Tier 1 cities. 

I have faced this myself, heard from friends and here on reddit. There have been owners not returning the security deposit, water and electricity problems or bad mobile connectivity issues.  


 I am thinking about creating a website like Glassdoor where users can  review and rate accommodation based on various parameters like:  


1. Behaviour of owners
2. Locality issues(water, electricity, connectivity etc)
3. Security deposit and its return
4. Building issues
5. Couple/Live-in/Party friendliness

&amp;#x200B;

Such a website would provide a platform to tenants to provide their remarks on how the accommodation turned out for them and that would be  valuable information for the next tenants. 

&amp;#x200B;

This would also bring in some accountability among land lords and owners as getting a bad review decreases their chances of getting next tenants.   


What I have thought as of now is very simple. A website having its entire page as a Google Maps with a search bar.   


User can browse the map and look for well rated apartments and can also use the search box to look up specific apartments/accommodations. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am fishing for more ideas on how this can be better and possible challenges that I might have to face.

This will be my first time traveling out of the US other than some minor resort excursions as a kid and I could use some advice. It seems like i decided to jump off the deep end with this one...

I will be traveling to India and Southeast Asia between October 2019 and April 2020. I have the first 5 weeks planned — I’m sitting a 10 day meditation course and then going on a 3 week pilgrimage to sacred sites in Northern India and Nepal. Beyond that, I’d like to continue traveling in India  for about a month before continuing on to Nepal, Burma, Thailand, Cambodia, and maybe Vietnam? It all really depends on how much I’m able to save up before leaving and how much I enjoy prolonged international travel. Maybe I’ll want to come home after 3 months, maybe I’ll get to April and want to keep going (I’m thinking of applying for the Australia/New Zealand under 30 work visa and heading out there after I’m done in SEAsia). For reference, I’ve been living in my Subaru Outback for the last year traveling around the West Coast working and exploring, so I have at least dipped my toes into minimal/itinerant living.

I am looking at applying for the Indian 10 year multi entry visa for US citizens that allows you to stay for 6 months at a stretch (ill want to have the option to be in India for longer than 2 months so the tourist EVisa wont work).

I have booked a multi city flight into New Delhi 10/11/2019, and out of Bangkok 4/1/2020. I am not certain that I will actually board the 2nd leg of that flight, but it was a cheap way to book and gives me plenty of breathing room to travel freely.

So, for the India Visa I know I need to submit an itinerary with my application that covers entry place, places I’ll be visiting in sequence, and exit place. I know when I’ll be entering and what I’ll be doing for the first 5 weeks, but beyond that I was hoping to leave it largely up in the air. How closely does my itinerary need to resemble where I really end up? Can I just pick a likely point/date of exit or must this be accurate? 

Also, I have heard that I need to be able to display my continuing travel plans upon entering India, otherwise I may be denied entry to the country altogether. Will my return flight from Bangkok to the US in April qualify, or do I need to book a flight out of India inside the 6 month window of my visa? Does this flight need to match what my Visa application itinerary states?

Am I crazy for trying to figure this all out without a travel agent?

Any additional travel advice/tips you’d like to share about the countries I’ve mentioned? Any advice on Visas and border crossings (I haven’t even started looking into this for countries other than India)?

Thanks so much for any help, I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed with the planning at the moment. Hoping 3 months is enough time to plan this whole thing out.",c8tdwy,,false,/r/india/comments/c8tdwy/help_with_india_visa_application_10_year_visa_for/,AskIndia

Hello all, My sister got a 49,000 rank in JEE Mains with Delhi domicile. She has got MAE in IGDTU till Round 1, but hasn't been upgraded till Round 3. Our options below in order of choice filling - 

1) IGDTU - ECE Electronics - I was expecting her to get this till round 3 but haven't till now, so a bit worried

2) NSUT - MPAE Manufacturing Process &amp; Automation Engg - Very difficult to get considering last year cutoffs - may get only after Round 4

3) DTU - MAM Mechanical &amp; Automotive Engg - May not get - high cutoff

4) NSUT - BT Biotechnology - Not a lucrative branch, but I have preferred it over other slightly better or similar branches of DTU because of lesser number of students (= better chance of getting placed)

5) IGDTU - MAE Mechanical &amp; Automation Engg - Allotted

6) DTU - PIE Production &amp; Industrial Engg - All of below branches are almost alike in placement scenario as all of them have very less/poor Core placement options. Students from these branches either go for Software, other Non-core profiles, MBA or MS. 

7) DTU - Civil

8) DTU - EP Engg Physics

9) DTU - Polymer

10) DTU - ENE Environmental Engg

11) DTU - BT Biotechnology

Of late I have been thinking if we should prefer BT, Polymer from DTU (far better college than IG) over MAE (better branch than BT) from IGDTU. I myself am from an IIT but from Civil branch and couldn't get a placement from campus. So I would totally prefer a better branch in place of better college but MAE is not an exceptional branch either. And she won't get IT in IGDTU either. 

Q1. Should I move DTU branches above MAE from IGDTU?

Q2. Considering no. of students, should I keep NSUT BT above DTU branches?

Q3. I have read some post on quora stating that NSUT is better for circuit branches, and DTU is better for rest. How true is that? 

Q4. Is ECE at IGDTU good enough? (if she gets it in further rounds)

Kindly suggest edits to the above order.

One thing has been irritating me everyday. Everytime I go to sleep and I wake up, I end up with messy hair. A lot of my hair gets intertwined with one another. To get it straight again, I'd have to run my fingers through it or brush it, but both of them cause some hair fall.

Should I be worried that I am losing hair like this? and How do I prevent messy hair while sleeping?

Also I wash my hair once or twice a week mostly due to the fact that my hair takes a lot of time to dry and I have to get to work in the morning.

Also I have a very dry scalp I guess, what could be a solution for it? Thanks a lot!!

Does diet affect the nourishment of the scalp? What oil should be using to get smooth hair? Should I just use conditioners instead of shampoos?

I also wear a skull cap and helmet while going to work. Could that also add up to the dryness?",cdgh71,,false,/r/india/comments/cdgh71/advicetips_to_avoid_dry_hairscalp_and_get/,AskIndia

I would really appreciate it if you could tell me what you think, both positive and negative. What could be some barriers/obstacles to implementing it in India? What could I use to my advantage?

We want to target teenage anemia by implementing a program in schools for a small fee which would teach young girls to cook (iron-rich, healthy) foods.  As part of the program they would make cookies which would then be sold in the city. The money would then be reinvested into the program and contribute to its expansion. A partner organization would transport food from the metropolitan area of Bihar to the rural areas, at first one or two villages in which we would test out the business model. It is a largely non-profit service, the only money to be won would be reinvested in the community. We would also conduct bi-annual blood tests to check the levels of anemia on the children/teenagers. We are still in the first steps of thinking it through, and of course there might be a lot of faulty thinking on our part. Let me know any ideas (what the cookies could be made of, would people in cities buy them/care if they knew where the money was going to, would we need additional partners, etc). Also appreciate any insight into Bihari culture, Bihari concerns in rural areas. Would parents be interested in paying a small fee for the program if they knew it would positively affect their young girls?

ABD (i don't consider myself confused), I'm looking for interesting Indian music that isn't from popular films. I would make exceptions for music from films that is particularly interesting or different, not your standard dance numbers or romantic songs. 

&amp;nbsp;

I was recently listening to the Dil Se soundtrack and found it really interesting, dynamic and quite different from your average bollywood movie! The music is not standard and even the production is not standard, there's a lot of dynamism in the tracks. For example, in Satarangi Re it starts off with that high pitch vocal singing and then suddenly breaks into the beat. I found it really great. 

&amp;nbsp;

Anyways, I also would love to find Indian music that isn't from movies. Like, is there a vibrant musician scene in India that isn't what we get internationally? Any hidden bands you really like that wouldn't have a chance to be marketed abroad? I'd also be interested in folk recordings. I'm not particularly interested in Classical music because those are quite easy to find and plentiful. 


&amp;nbsp;

Things I'm not looking for:

* Dance beat songs
* autotuned vocals
* highly repetitive lyrics

Dark skinned people are shown as ugly, or many times villainous, in most stories.","People of India are relatively dark skinned people. 

And we hate dark skin. That means we love to indulge in self-hate. This distorts our self perception, and affects us in so many different ways I cannot enumerate in a single post. I have seen people act distant from their 2 year old child because the kid was somewhat darker. That's just an example, and not to say that every parent hates their dark skinned kid. But almost every parent DOES wish they had a fair skinned kid. All such factors and others combine to create my opinion that prejudice against dark skin is a form of self hate, and we need to change it.


I have three questions in a bid to provoke answers and thought:

1. Do you think dark skin should not be stigmatized in media and life, and what do you think we can do about it?

2. Do you have suggestions of names of dark skinned beauties, whether male or female, especially those from India. Right now I can't seem to come up with beautiful dark skinned people in India, because our media and movies diabolically only promote fairer skin people. 

3. What do you think we can do to promote the idea that dark does not mean ugly? 

It is not just the media that is biased: people themselves are hugely biased against dark skin. Its tragic, sad and has very negative consequences for all of us.

I recently applied, and got approved for a Credit Card, and I just have a few questions regarding the impact of the CC on my CIBIL score. I am planning on applying for a student loan in a year for studying abroad, which is why my CIBIL score is important to me.

I didn't really get a CC for the purpose of having a credit facility. I just got it for the payback points and other perks (like the complementary airport lounge visit). My bank couldn't give me a high credit limit as I am working in an entry level position earning 20k pm. They just gave me a credit limit of 20k. My expenses for a month usually reach around 10k to 15k, which I would like to make using my CC for the payback points. However, as I understand it, having a high credit utilization ratio can have a negative impact on my credit score. This brings me to my first question; if I keep paying off my CC after each transaction, will it reduce my credit utilization ratio. So for example, if I want to spend 15k in a month, I would spend 5k, then pay off the amount due on my CC, spend another 5k, pay it off, and then spend another 5k and pay it off. Does this mean that my credit utilization ratio would be 25%(5k/20k) or would it be 75%(15k/20k) for the said month? Another similar question is, if I spend 45k in a single month like I mentioned above (spend 15k, payoff 15k.....) what would be my credit utilization ratio? Like I said before, I don't really care about availing credit facility and I'm going to be using my CC just like a Debit Card (i.e. paying it off as soon as I spend anything on it).

Is there no privilege of being an Indian, that I could use to my advantage? Some legal edge for business? Some provision of law allowing better access to financial instruments and investments?

Any argument I can come up with, ends with, if you as much effort over there you will be better off 10x. And I am really unable to wrap my head around this.

I am applying for MCA through the CAP rounds and wanted to know how the MCA course fares at VJTI in terms of teaching faculty, syllabus, extra curriculars and ofcourse placements.

Regarding placements, I have 58% in 12th which takes me off the usual 60% throughout (10th,12th, graduation) criteria, but my 10th and graduation scores are above 85%. Also, 99.9%ile in the MAH-MCA CET.
So just wanted to enquire this as well, if non criteria companies do make it to campus or if the criteria changes with each company.

I looked at their placement statistics and they have a worrying column of ""eligible students"", but no eligibility criteria has been defined there.

I'm just concerned that even after doing well in this course, I'd not be placed or be placed with a poor package just because of the institute.

Also in a relationship since the past six years with a guy who belongs to scheduled caste and is doing MS surgery. My parents are aware that I am in a relationship  with someone from a different caste and they're completely okay with it and caste is definitely not an issue for them.

One of my cousins(28M) got engaged last night and as it happens, I was asked by a few relatives about my marriage plans etc. My grandfather asked my mom about this ""one guy I have been posting pictures with regularly for the past five years"" and whether he's my boyfriend or not. My mom told him he's just a friend but he obviously wasn't buying it and was curious to know about the caste of ""this friend"". 

When he got to know the dude's SC he seemed pretty miffed and started lecturing her about how SCs and lower castes have a certain MENTALITY and how much ever they progress in life the MENTALITY will never change. Since I have studied in a professional college, obviously I have come across certain general category kids talking about how SCs, STs etc have a certain MENTALITY and they'll always stay the same chahe kuch bhi hojaye. Never really cared or paid attention to kids saying this crap but now I am really curious to know what this MENTALITY everyone keeps going on about is. 

So PLEASE TELL ME what are the stereotypes you have heard about regarding ""lower castes"" or sterotypes you have had to speak up against or have faced because you belong from a certain caste yourself!?

I absolutely do NOT want to pay the notice period shortfall.

**How do I go about this?**

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is indeed long, but please read through for details-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The sequence of events in summary:

1. I resigned (official email date 1st January 2019), requested a relieving date from my Manager.
2. My Manager confirmed resignation acceptance &amp; **he proposed the last working day as 28th February 2019**, on email (HR in copy).
3. Per discussion with the Manager, I completed my handover of projects/documentation. I complete last work day formalities &amp; wait for full and final settlement.
4. On March 25th, HR tells me I have to pay a notice period shortfall waiver of 1 month. (citing notice period in contract being 3 months &amp; I have served 2 months )
5. I try to explain, that the date was NOT proposed by me. I followed notice period as advised by the manager &amp; as discussed between me &amp; the manager.
6. They say - Whatever is written in contract takes precedence. Moreover HR cites that the Manager did not explicitly mention in email that the notice period is waived off. I have to pay if I have to clear the dues for the retirals to be processed.
7. Furthermore, HR says this matter is upto discretion of the management ( Management = Centre head of the premises I worked at)
8. My manager is spineless, but I have brought in level-up manager (American) in the communication chain &amp; I would be meeting the centre head in about 9-10 days. (he is out of India right now)

\---

&amp;#x200B;

I have worked for the company for past 6 years. (Out of total 11 years of my total work experience)The company is an Indian division of a giant European MNC.

About a decade ago, the Indian division was mostly a manufacturing facility in Gujarat.

Our centre head is someone who is a veteran from that setup &amp; mostly runs the centre basis same factory-driven-mindset, with loads of hierarchy &amp; ""well set"" grooves and ""network"" of managers.  
That is not how the MNC functions outside India, but the P&amp;L centre shows profit every year, so I guess the counterparts don't interfere.

Since I received the ""Notice period shortfall recovery email"" from HR in March 2019, I have been escalating the issue &amp; seeking a waiver on it, since it was not my suggestion to have a 2 month notice period.

&amp;#x200B;

HR Manager's manager had this overall input ""It is a *small* amount.. You should part ways on good note..""

The HR manager's manager borderline threatened me for the escalation with

""Do you want us to tell **this** when we get a call for background check anytime in the future?""

&amp;#x200B;

He also mentioned, that this is the process they follow &amp; ultimate discretion lies with management now.

So, I figured, it is pointless talking to him.*I did some digging and there was this IT/Systems in charge fellow who resigned recently. He served the notice period &amp; for whatever reason, his manager let him go 2 days earlier, that too with a record on email.Still, he was asked to pay 2 days worth of notice period recovery amount, before his dues were cleared!!He paid it up since he was supposed to leave abroad for his next job &amp; it was a small amount which he didn't want to hold up the larger settlement dues over that.*

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It simply blows my mind, that a company like such is actually hell bent on making money off notice period shortfalls, especially where the parting is mutual &amp; hasn't even caused any business harm/loss or lack of transfer of work.

I absolutely do **NOT** want to pay the notice period shortfall.**How do I go about this?**

I was thinking about:

1. Writing to the ombudsperson (reporting helpline for intercompany disputes) - to get some global heat in this.
2. Writing about this to as many functional head &amp; Global HR email addresses I can gather to just get this escalated so much, that it cannot be just pressed down.
3. Getting lawyer's opinion on this. (I would really like to avoid any legal proceeding, since that would call for a lot of work, time, money!)

Anyone with similar pain and has recovered completely?,"Can anyone tell me why I'm experiencing pain specifically in th area of the dimples of Venus and it's immediate vicinity?

4 months ago I did some deadlift like I normally used to do. The ""pain"" next day seemed quite normal except, it has persisted till date. It wasn't so severe in the beginning. But starting from April till May, I was required to sit on a chair for 10-12 hours per day (studies).

During this period, I quit gym too. My body became quite stiff during this time and I regularly twisted my back to relieve some built up stress - Cracking it once in a while. But one of these times I felt a seating pain in my lower back which rendered me unable to lean/bend forward. Even walking was painful- anything which required some work from my back was.

The very next day I visited a doctor who adviced me for an X-ray, and said that there might have been a minor sprain. This subsided within a couple of day. But the pain in my dimples of Venus still lingered on. If I walked too much or sat too much with a break, it would hurt a lot. Then again next day after some sleep it would return to the baseline constant mild pain.

After May, I decided to give my back some rest and quit sitting on chairs almost completely. I coupled it with some swimming and today, it has reduced drastically. I've started stretching my lower back as a part of rehabilitation- cat and camel poses, superman pose et al. But still there's a little bit of that feeling of pain. Even today, if I sit for more than 30 minutes, I start feeling uneasy in that particular area. It also seems like my upper hips also seem to pull back whenever I try bend, as if the muscles of that area have become less flexible. Massaging the sciatic area helps a lot.

Has anyone else here also experienced similar pain? Because I plan to study for at least 1-1.5 more years and if this persists, it hampers my preparation. Please advice, good people.",c7qu7u,,false,/r/india/comments/c7qu7u/injuries_lower_back_pain_anyone_with_similar_pain/,AskIndia

Since it is a different community.  
I was deeply rooted to Jainism and my faith in teachings of God.  
When I was in my 4th, 5th class. I used to experience immense loneliness. I had no friends in school, and my friends used to bully me. I was too ideal. I used to avoid this loneliness by following strict self discipline and control of my thoughts. One day I remember I experienced meditative state when I woke up.  
I don't know what happened to my loneliness and fast forward I don't remember any mental trouble in 6th, 7th, 8th classes.  
As I reached puberty, my father gave me computer, and computer operator installed pornographic images and flash in the computer. Till date, I am not able to restrain myself from watching porn images. I have tried many times, but had not been able to control myself. It is normal in my generation to watch porn. But, I feel severe guilt and shame after watching it. And you know the reason, due to my immense faith in teachings of God.  
Due to immense influence of people on Internet when playing computer games, and porn images on Internet, I had became very reckless kid.  
When I went to college, I decided to get a girl friend. So, I did all bad things like drinking alcohol, and showing people that I am very powerful by beating them.  
After, I got the girl, my ego had crossed all limits of existence. I started reading about some Jainism texts on the web, and I related my meditative experience in my childhood as qualities that are only possessed by revered monks according to Jainism.  
One day I was reading Jainism scriptures with my father, and I was reading a topic of Ego.  
During that reading, I realised that I have done big sin by thinking that I posses quality that is only possessed by revered monks. After that I broke up, and thought I will go to Hell. Only future Thirthankar story helped me regain my confidence.  


So, after going back to college, I started practicing all the strict lifestyle according to Jainism and did extreme penance.  
So, everyone started noticing me and I had been taken to mental hospital. I was treated by Dr. Prakash Shukla in Raipur. I was there in his nursing center for few time. I was given many injections during that time. I had to take year drop in college.  
Then, I joined the college back again, and after 1 year, I thought that I have become healthy and I don't need more medicines. Again I started practising extreme lifestyle, and again I was taken to nursing center where I was given injections which made me forgot everything.  
We didn't like how Dr. Prakash Shukla used to treat me, so we changed our doctor to Dr. Sudhir Bhave in Nagpur.  
Till then I am taking medicines from him.  
He tells since it is a repeat case, it will take 10-15 years to get cured.

Here’s my story.

Growing up I’ve always wondered what happy families are like.

I’ve been raised by 3 females, all from different generations. My elder sis, mom and nani. My father’s all well and alive, but he’s been away for the entirety life working as a doctor for the government.

My mother’s been working 12 hours a day since my childhood so she didn’t have enough time for me as well. My sis has been way too dominating and has always either outspoken or shushed me. And my nani always wanted two daughters. I’ve grown up introverted with anxiety issues.

My father hasn’t been the best role model either, he was never there when I needed him and has only ever done enough so as to pay for my college. 

I wasn't really raised with any practical teachings that a father usually passes on in order for their sons to be 'men' and to grow up, and prepare them to be 'the man of the house.'. I’ve had to learn things like shaving and driving by myself.

&amp;#x200B;

A bit about myself:

I'm a 28-year-old dude from Bangalore (originally Kerala) that started collecting records around 6-7 years ago after discovering the vinyl community on Youtube. Had no idea that vinyl was still a viable format until then but everything about it from the large album covers to the ritual involved in dropping the needle on the record appealed to me. Bought my first record (Marvin Gaye’s What’s Going On) a few months later and haven’t stopped since.

Currently have around 300+ records with the majority of it being Jazz and Prog Rock. Apart from that I also have some Krautrock, Zeuhl, New Wave, Psych/Pop Rock, Folk, Soul, Funk, Afrobeat, MPB, Tropicalia, Minimalism, Old School Hip-Hop and more. Some of my favourite artists are Mahavishnu Orchestra, Miles Davis, Zappa, Can, Fela Kuti, King Crimson, Talking Heads, Magma, Milton Nascimento and tons of others. (I regularly post pics from my collection on IG @sickofeverythingbutmusic)

I had always been into music, especially music from the 50's all the way to the 80's and since most of this music was originally released on vinyl, it felt like the perfect format to listen to this music on. Bought most of my records during my years in Malaysia and the UK.

Have a Rega RP1 fitted with a Nagaoka MP-110 cartridge, a Marantz PM6005 amp and Acoustic Energy Aegis Evo 3 Floorstanding Speakers. Quite satisfied with my current setup except for the fact that I have to place my turntable on top of my amp due to a lack of space.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's a pic of my collection:

https://i.redd.it/scya97f3dza31.jpg

&amp;#x200B;

I think it would be cool if other vinyl enthusiasts could answer the following questions in order to give us a better idea of your tastes and collection:

1. How old are you?
2. Which city are you from?
3. How many records do you own?
4. What kind of turntable, amp and speakers do you have?
5. How old were you when you started collecting records?
6. What started your interest in music?
7. What got you interested in vinyl?
8. Where do you buy your records from?
9. What’s the first record you ever got?
10. What is your prized possession?
11. What genres do you collect?

I study in a well reputed college and have been scoring good marks ( 84% as of now, 8.4 CGPA) throughout my course although my scores seems to be dropping semester after semester.

I went for engineering coaching and got really interested to take it mainly because I wasn't exposed to any other streams other than engineering and medicine. So I took Computer Science as my degree because I had a faint interest in it and it had a lot of job opportunities. 

But since my second year I started hating computer science, every aspect of it. I know many like it but it's just a no-go for me. I tried many fields like Block chain, Web Designing (had a little interest, the coding part ruined it), Machine learning, IoT, etc. but nothing sparks any interest in me. Now, just hearing the fact that I have to do the project and seminar for next year just brings me pain.

Now I have no idea what to do. There are campus placements in my college the coming year and I don't think I can pass them in the case of interviews or logical questioning as I am really bad at coding and most theory parts. And even if I pass, I don't think I will be interested in the work too.

I have a lot of interest in studying architecture and anything that ignites the creative spark in me(which Computer science doesn't). I am interested a lot in Photography (I take good photos too) and Graphic Design as well. But the career scope in these are very small compared to computer science. Also I have no idea how to develop these skills to a career/professional level one without committing to them, which in turn waste my time on studies and computer science.

What should I do?  Do I continue with computer science till I get an interest in it (which I don't think I will) or should I change my whole career to something else that I am interested in??

EDIT: I know changing careers would be a huge task and risk for me so I am trying my best to find a suitable field for me in computer science itself. Changing careers is like my last resort and I wouldn't do it unless I really want to.

We recently graduated from our college and were planning to get a good job. She is from a very underdeveloped village and was given scholarship by the government to study. Her parents are socially backward and never contributed for her well being and were against of her education from start. Her mom is abusive and her father is an alcoholic. She is the only one in her family to graduate. Her sister dropped out of the school and works as a part time maidservant. The one who supported her through tough times is her aunt. Her aunt fought with her parents and supported her through graduation, but she later passed away last december. Now that her aunt is out of the way her parents are trying to claim her as their own. Her parents are forcing her to marry a 43 year-old for their personal gain. Basically this man is ready to offer her parents three lakhs rupees ( roughly 4354 USD) in exchange of their daughter. The man in question is very shady. He has many lawsuits filed over him and is potentially connected with the local gang members. He is avoiding his jail time because of his political connections and power. He is already married to two women 41F and 32F and has four children, eldest being a 19 year old boy.

My friend do not know what to do. She cried yesterday while being with our other friends. We are motivating her to move away from her parents and start her own life. But she is too scared to take any actions.

If the marriage continues and they both get married, her life will get ruined. She will get abused more and will be forced to work in kitchen for rest of her life.

Can I earn some sort of money through this? What are the ways to do this? Upwork , Fiverr? Would  it be enough to serve as personal pocket money?

Under the banner of 'sanskar' these folks literally fuck up their child's life.

Blaming, defaming, threatening and even hitting to the extent that children are psychological devastated by the time they hit teenage.

Worse? You cannot reason out with them nor can you deal with the situation because they sure come up with something due to their narcissism. Moreover, they think they are perfect and always use the wildcard that they faced hardship in their childhood.

Well, I understand that they are not to be blamed completely as their parents brought them up the same way and cycle continues but somewhere something needs to fixed.

Why do you think Indian parents destroy a child psychologically and what can be done to change it?

With every passing day, I am finding it difficult to deal with my parents. All they care about is me getting married, a very very high paying job and giving the grandkids so their social status remains high at the cost of my own happiness.

For those who know which channel I am talking about, do you have any information on the background of those children? Are they orphaned/underprivileged/both ? Is there any article/report where I can find more info?

The reason I want to know more is simple: if that guy's legit, I would promote his channel among friends, and also maybe donate (through a link that appears in the description) to his cause, so that more and more needy children are helped.

This caught my attention and I researched a little about it and turns out all the so called “developed” countries use developing countries to manage their waste. There is a Wikipedia page about it.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_waste_trade

India is among the dumping yard as well!.

https://www.deccanherald.com/content/596894/hazardous-waste-dumping-india-sc.html

Shouldn’t India worry about it’s own waste and try implement better waste management solutions?.

Also what is the point of calling such countries developed when they are not able to deal with their waste. Shouldn’t they be well equipped to handle such things. Isn’t it kind of colonialism?.

Such are the things which make me question and in a way despise western countries.
Don’t get the wrong idea of hatred but many such things are always camouflaged with western countries.

But despite all such things a moth will still get attracted towards brightest light i guess.

Hi r/india!

Can y’all please help me with a little career advice? I searched through countless threads and websites and just couldn’t find anything substantial.

I’m currently in college and have taken up Marketing as my specialization stream. I don’t really have an idea what I’m supposed to do further in this field, or any one for that matter although I’d like to study abroad if that would be possible.

So my primitive course of action right now is - 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Look for colleges offering marketing related courses.
2. Check the requirements for their acceptance.
3. In the meanwhile, prepare for GMAT (or other competitive exams) in my ongoing final year (how?)

How’s this ‘plan’ looking? What am I missing out? Any other pointers?

Then they start their emotional torture.

""Jiski wajah se iss duniya me hai tu ussi ke liye tere paas paise nahi hai?"".

""Bhagwaan ko jitna dega usse sau-guna bhagwaan dega tujhe"".

Title is pretty self-explanatory. To elaborate, I'm a white guy and have lived in India for several years. My girlfriend is Bengali. Today she convinced me to buy a kurta. I've owned several in the past, mostly for use at weddings, Diwali parties and other formal functions. She wants me to have one just to wear casually, since she ""likes guys in kurtas.""

But honestly, I feel kind of uncomfortable wearing a full-length kurta around town. It seems like scarcely any Indian guys in urban areas use them for daily wear. Worse yet, my \[female\] Indian friends seem pretty split on whether kurtas tend to look ""retarded"" on goras. 

I know this is a petty question that boils down to self-confidence and personal preference, but I'm really curious to hear what Indians at large think.

I need some help. One of my neighbor is using his plot adjacent to my house as a sand dump yard. He illegally transports sand from a nearby river and dumps it in his plot using tractors. Then at night he uses a JCB to load the sand onto dumpers trucks to transfer it out of state. 

Now the problem that I have is they do most of there loading work at night which causes major nuisance. Second being, his vehicles have hit our property a few times damaging its structure. We don't have a perimeter wall at the moment so his vehicles have hit our septic tank and pump structure damaging it in the process. All this has happened in the past 3 years with the recent incident being 2 weeks ago. 

When we complain to him regarding the damages he says sorry but he doesn't do anything so that they are not repeated in the future. While I am in the process of building a perimeter wall I do believe that one day they will end up damaging the wall itself.

Also on the matter of why we are not filing a public complain against him is that   the guy and his father are know for un-proven murder and general nuisance. I don't want my family to suffer.

What is the best action to take in this situation? I am not sure police can help. I am sure officials are involved too with the illegal sand trade and any complain against the plot owner will bring out my identity. What can we do so that he takes his business elsewhere?

She told me that there is a girls school (or university) there now. So I just want to ask the people of Ludhyana (or Punjab in general) to tell me what it is like there. And maybe if possible, tell me which school this might be.

What I can tell about Gujranwala is that the inner city is very crowded, with lots of small businesses and food stalls. There are lots of motorcycles everywhere and the streets are really chaotic. People are very nationalistic and religious. Punjabi is spoken by everybody, but upper class people speak urdu with their children (my parents only speak in Punjabi with us when they are angry).

My college has a rule that once you get an offer from a company, you can only apply for some other company if it offering 2 times more than your current offers. (If you get an offer of 5LPA from Company A, you can only apply to company B if it offering more than 10LPA).
Due to this rule, I am not able to apply to a lot of companies. 
So how to get to know about the off campus drive of various companies, is there any particular resource where such things are updated? Or has anyone gone through off campus placement?

I started 11th grade (PCM) about 2 months ago and I'm not really sure about what to focus on. Obviously I'd like to get into a  decent IIT but I seriously doubt I'm cut out for that, considering its sheer difficulty and competition, and the fact that it's probably only going to get worse year after year. I don't want to only slog for 2 years, and possibly destroy my mental health (which is already not in the best state atm) for a very small chance of getting a seat. One of the other reasons is because I plan on applying to universities in the USA and Canada, so for that I'd need to make sure not only my grades, but also my extracurriculars and such to be good, which I'm not sure I can accomplish if I put 100% of my effort into prepping for the JEE-A. I want a healthy balance between studies and free time, which I can use to build up my portfolio and also socialise. So, I've been thinking of prepping almost only for the Mains/BITSAT.

Comparing with the western ''civilized'' nations, India has seen a very minuscule number of serial killers in the past 60-70 years. Though someone may argue about the cases not being reported but I find it an unconvincing argument that a crime of that magnitude can go unreported. The reason I find this interesting is that it is relatively easier to commit a crime and hide in the crowd here in India owing to the population. Chances of getting caught are also lower than, say USA. Also, majority of the killers have a troubled childhood and mental illnesses a lot of which gets undiagnosed here in India.

The last 8 - 10 years have been pretty bad, with the stress of IIT prep, followed by getting into and surviving grad school, followed by a job and now promotions.

I'm pretty stressed out and anxious all the time, and this has taken a hit on my general mood, social life etc. I've been putting off a lot of stuff I've always wanted to do (eg. learn a foreign language, become a better cook etc.), in pursuit of the next ""goal"". I'm super worried this is going to continue happening, with future promotions, marriage, kids etc - there's always this feeling that I should be working to reach the next checkpoint in the journey of life. I fear that I'm focussing too much on the destination without really enjoying the journey.

It also does not help that I'm used to super competitive environments - many of my classmates from school went to IITs for CS/EE etc, undergrad classmates went to IIMs/top foreign places etc - my current job has top students from India and around the world - including folks from places like MIT, Stanford etc. I cannot help but feel inferior and compare myself to everyone else.

It does not help that I live in a bubble of sorts, and that there is so much news/information about people's successes.

The second biggest issue being that both my parents do not walk at all and are very weak in terms of stamina and overall health. Now if one has to really see a city, one has to Walk a couple of miles at the very least- and I doubt my parents will be able to do that.

I broke up with my girlfriend a few months ago and I've been looking into getting back in the game. I set up Tinder and after a few dozen matches (all of the other conversations died out), I finally set up a coffee date with one girl! She's pretty cute, at least in the picture, and I don't want to fuck this up. All the relationships I've had in the past were with girls I've known for a long time (both of my previous girlfriends were from school and college, so I knew them well before starting a relationship). This is the first time I'm going on a date with a complete stranger. We talked a bit on Tinder and I know what she does and stuff, but there's still a lot I don't know about her, and one of the goals of this coffee date is so we can talk more about ourselves and see if we are compatible. Or, at least, that's my plan. She might just be using me for free coffee lol I don't know, but it's worth the chance I think, because she is kinda cute.

Any advice? What to start with? What to talk about and what to possibly avoid? This is the first actual ""stranger-date"" I've been to so I'm sorta nervous haha.

13 year old car damaged by a tree falling on it. Repair costs are Rs.1.34L.

IDV of the car is 1.62L. Insurance Payable is Rs.91,000.

The terms and conditions, 

&gt; The insured vehicle shall be treated as a  Constructive Total Loss if the aggregate cost of retrieval and / or  repair of the vehicle, subject to terms and conditions of the policy,  exceeds  75% of the IDV of the vehicle. 

But Oriental Insurance is saying that since their liability or insurance payable does not exceed 75% of the IDV of the vehicle, the claim will be a repair settlement.

I've filed a grievance on IRDA's IGMA grievance portal, PG Portal, spoken to Oriental's Regional Manager -  Mrs. Sunita Gupta and their DGM - Dr. Ashok Kumar Jain - from the Residency Road office in Bangalore. They reiterate the same lies, that it is based on Insurance Payable and not on the repair cost.

Three things:

1) If your insurance company tries to wiggle out of a total loss claim by saying a total loss is based on the liability of the insurance company - they think you are naive and stupid. Don't fall for it!

2) NEVER EVER buy your insurance policies from Oriental Insurance. Especially if you are from Bangalore

3) What options do I have to get them to close this as a total loss settlement without having to deal with our toothless judicial system?",cc1jyh,,false,/r/india/comments/cc1jyh/oriental_insurance_trying_to_scam_me_out_of_a/,AskIndia

Recently one of my friends who works in an MNC was placed on the bench after her project was finished. After a couple of weeks she felt that she was wasting a lot of time commuting and being on bench and not doing much work while on the bench so she took unsanctioned leave for a month to focus on preparation for CAT (stupid move on her part and I have informed her of this lol) and didn't collect any pay during this period. After a while the upper management found out about this, and asked her to report to work immediately and regularly from that point onwards after a meeting with her questioning her on why she had done that. Although she returned to work, her log time had shortage from the minimum required hours for the first few days after her return. The management on finding out about this issued her a show cause notice to explain why this happened despite informing her and that if her explanation was unsatisfactory they would take 'disciplinary action including possible termination of her employment' under some HR clause which states that the employee must report to work on time and complete the minimum required hours.

Even though I advised her to explain herself and hope for the best (despite having no clue what a show cause notice was) but she fears impending termination and how it would affect her future employment. She feels its better to resign before she gets terminated and focus on her CAT preparation but she fears the implications of putting in her papers in this current situation. Especially because the showcause notice said that  'disciplinary action will be taken including termination of employment' if she didnt respond or her explanation wasn't satisfactory. She's confused if the 'including termination' means that there is some other disciplinary action that can also be taken. She mostly fears the possibility of a court case being filed against her by the company if she submits her resignation as she doesn't want to get involved in that sort of thing with a company with seemingly infinite resources and just wants to take some time off to prepare.

So we would be grateful if you could help advise what she should do in the situation. Specifically:

1. What other disciplinary action can the company take against her?  She knows she is in the wrong. But she fears a court case being filed against her and doesn't want to get involved in that.  Although I find it unlikely for this to happen I don't know much about Law and don't want to advise her before I get some proper insight from r/india. What are the chances of her getting sued if she resigns now?
2. Is it better to explain herself and hope the HR doesnt terminate her employment or would be it be better for her to resign before she gets terminated so that her future employment isnt in jeapordy since the termination will enter her record forever?

What would be her best course of action in this situation?

Thanks in advance for all the advice.",ci0838,,false,/r/india/comments/ci0838/need_some_assistance_regarding_a_showcause_notice/,AskIndia

* [Sony KLV-40R252F](https://www.sony.co.in/electronics/televisions/r252f-series/specifications) 

* [Samsung UA43N5100ARLXL](https://www.samsung.com/in/tvs/fhdtv-n5100/UA43N5100ARLXL/)

I don't really mind the difference between 40 and 43 inches as such and the other brands like Mi, TCL are not to my liking. I have checked both TVs in the showroom and I like the sound on the Samsung better while the Sony's display is better.

I will mostly be using this TV for gaming (PS4, Nintendo Switch) and the occasional sports and maybe a movie or two. 

Could you advice me on which one is better? Or maybe a 3rd TV you'd know of that's in my budget (around 36k INR)?",ci4omz,,false,/r/india/comments/ci4omz/please_suggest_which_one_to_choose_between_sony/,AskIndia

I have been reading on many websites and trying to find out the processes, terminology and what not - just to be stuck in reading but not doing anything.

Randian's who have managed to and/or doing it on there own, please put in your experiences and guides to do the needful.

I'd like to stress here that though the process is considered simpler now, it seems far too bureaucratic  for a IT simpleton like me. From what I have read and understood:

* LLP or Private Limited are better than OPC (why?)
* LLP or PL need 3 people, while OPC needs one and one for nomination
* register company, get some secure USB token
* register trade marks (but no idea how to register different company names and products - like One97 and Paytm) for apt classes (35 to 45) or in all of them
* dedicated Office : needed or not?
* GST, VAT, etc :  what's needed and when?

And then there is freelancing and creating your own product - for which what and what not's are not clear anywhere. because presumably you'd need trademark and stuff there too and you also need TAN and PAN and DIN and current accounts and etc.

What I am interested in creating my web based product, and deploying it and making money. problem is I don't know if it is actually that simple.

So I don't want to make it about myself. I'd like this to be for others too who might want to seek up similar help or who'd step on this path in future.

So I have been using the Jio Giga Fiber for more than a year. 

My basic use is streaming (Netflix, Prime, Hotstar etc.) and downloading via torrents and some debrid sites (alldebrid/real debrid/premiumize.me etc). 

Till about 2-3 weeks back, I was getting consistent speeds of 90 mbps+ on almost all sites, with no throttling whatsoever. 

About 2 weeks back, I noticed that speeds on torrents and debrid sites has fallen to 15-20 mbps. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Changed DNS (cycled between Google, Cloudfare and Jio) to no use

\- Bought subs to different debrid sites, and the speeds are consistent (about 3 MBps) on all sites (and torrents)

\- Speedtest to Indian servers on [Speedtest.net](https://Speedtest.net) shows 100 mbps connection, same with Netflix (local CDNs I guess)

\- Speedtest to foreign servers (Singapore, HK etc) shows speeds of 10-20 mbps, with high pings

&amp;#x200B;

I also have an Airtel broadband connection - 40 mbps. I tried the same links with Airtel, and they max out the connection within seconds, so most likely the issue is with Jio. 

&amp;#x200B;

Did a tracert to some of the debrid sites for both Jio and Airtel. Airtel showed 6 hops, Jio 12 hops. 

&amp;#x200B;

I called Jio's CC and they basically said as long as ANY server shows 100 mbps speeds, they cannot do anything and they do not have a way to escalate it further. 

&amp;#x200B;

Checked with a friend who stays about 4-5 kms away, in a different society and uses Jio. He is facing the same issue. 

&amp;#x200B;

    I lost one of my number linked to my account ( Aadhaar). So I went to nearby Jio outlet to get a new sim with same number. At first they asked for my aadhar card which I gave to them . One of the employee scanned it using their Jio app and said to me yeah your account has a Jio number linked to it now tell me which number you wanted to get a replacement. 
      So I gave them a number and got a new sim. I received an OTP on my secondary number and they said the new sim will be active in few hours. I paid ₹50 ( I guess it should be free) but anyhow I left the store as soon as new sim was handed to me.
     But on the same day evening I saw an notification on MyJio app on my phone. It said a new unknown number was added to my account ( this is not the one I got replacement). The notification said a new number was added "" Choose another service to add"" and showed 4 options ( Mobile ,jioFi, GigaFiber , JioLink)  . This new number is added to my account ( Aadhar) without my consent and approval. I tried to reach Jio customer service using ""Live chat"" option in MyJio app which is useless because all I can see a chatbot giving me options to choose.  Then I tried on twitter but didn't get any response.
Finally, called to service after a long conversation with IVR finally got a chance talk to a human.
    Then at first he(agent on phone) said he couldn't do anything from his side and advised me to visit the retailer. Then after some serious conversation and putting me on hold, he said that  he will block new unknown number and asked me to confirm my aadhar details so I did. (This confirmed me that the new number has linked with my aadhar which is without my approval) . 
    If anyone have gone through this please let me know and I wanted to know if I can legally proceed and file a complaint on jio for misusing my personal information.

Think of it as a buffet of sorts.

I was excited initially, and was actually thinking abt sampling some of the restaurants here, but the prices seem a bit steep for me, 1000 bucks for 1 person for the ones I wanna visit. Also, there's a distinction between imported meats (which you can't order) and the rest of the meats. 

At best, I think this scheme is suited for really high end restaurants, whose dishes are expensive enough to buy a slot and taste them out. 

Of course if you're a fan of non-alcoholic drinks, freakshakes and whatnot, you're in for a treat bcoz all that is covered in the cover charges. (entire menu!
) 


Also, looks like a lot of food is gonna get wasted this way. No doggy bags here either. People are just gonna order on whim and throw away the remaining food. 

What do you think?

In the light of some selfish thoughts, here's my zomato Gold code - use it to avail 20% off on Zomato Gold memberships, which can be used to avail Infinity Dining.

I graduated in 2018 with good grades from a reputed college in Bangalore. My degree certificate says ""First Class with Distinction"".

But I don't feel like I learned anything in my time as an undergraduate. The faculty were utterly useless and did little to stir interest amongst the students in the subjects they taught. Nor did my professors ever know anything outside their textbooks, even going so far as to preach outright lies because that's how they'd always been doing it for all these years. The only thing I feel like I got out of my experiences in college were all the projects I did. Being a student allowed me participate in 4 racing events. That's all I feel like I reaped from my undergraduate education.

I'm not here to shit on the Indian education system, because I know enough of that is done on the internet. I've been working for a year, and I feel like it's time to pursue a Post Graduate degree. None of the bigger, well paying companies in the mechanical/automobile/aerospace sector really pay any attention to undergraduates anyway, and they usually end up with dead end supervisor roles (or so I'm told).

So should I even bother trying to pursue an Mtech in Mechanical Engineering from an Indian university? I've heard that it isn't worth it unless you get it from an IIT or BITS. Mind you, some people tell me that the teaching there is shit too.

I've started to shift my focus abroad. But I know studying abroad means working abroad to pay off my student loans. I'm not a big fan of that idea, and don't want to spend a significant portion of my youth outside the country. There are a lot of personal reasons behind that. (Don't worry, I'm not forsaking my career for a girl)

Sorry you had to read all that. I'll finally get to my question. Was it worth doing an Mtech (specifically in M.E.) in India? Did you end up getting a good job? If you did it abroad, did you end up spending a long time there? Were you able to pay off your student loans easily?

Of course I know each individual case is different, and it all depends on how well you study. I'm just a little lost and could use some guidance. Thank you!",cjqcjb,,false,/r/india/comments/cjqcjb/mechanical_engineers_was_it_worth_pursuing_a/,AskIndia

Not saying that this behaviour is exclusive to us, but I'm sure a lot of us have witnessed this first hand. What's the worst incident you recall first hand of Indian folks behaving badly abroad?

For me:

1. Our flight was awaiting departure at the Malaysia airport. Suddenly, the weather turned bad and it started raining very heavily on the runway. The pilot announced that there would be a delay of few minutes due to weather conditions. Hardly 2 mins later, this Indian lady - a honeymooner from her looks, gets up and starts yelling at the crew. ""Explain to me what is the issue"", ""what is the estimated time for fixing the issue"", ""Oh so our time has no value after paying so much money?""... BC pakka some IT mid level manager who kept yelling to ""fix issue asap"" at the poor crew. Her husband was of course supportive and joined her in the shouting match. Eventually, it took some co-passengers to calm them down.
2. Possibly the worst people to board a plane could be found on the Bangkok route. Groups and groups of crass middle aged men making lewd comments about the air hostess, or hell, even singing antakshari at night because they thought it'd be funny. Even more tharkis asking their co-passengers where to get the best ""maal"".
3. Seen many people throwing trash on the streets (habit from India), being obnoxious to other tourists (mocking them for their physical appearance or ethnicity) and sharing like 1 beer amongst 5 people. While in Pattaya, a HUGE number of establishments (strip clubs, bars and lounges) turn away Indians for these reasons. If they see brown guys approaching, they just tell them ""Sorry, members only"".
4. Reasonably well behaved in hard-assed Singapore. I wonder why...
5. On a flight to Dubai, after the flight took off, a Muslim guy got up and started looking for something in the overhead compartment. So, this moron sitting next to me calls the air hostess and asks her to check what he is doing. ""Bomb nikla toh?"" he said that so loudly that even the Muslim man heard it. Turns out, the Muslim man was just taking out his lunch box.

That is a really obnoxious thing to say to somebody but as a nine year old I thought that's what rich people say and the neighborhood where I grew up in which is a little town in the Northeast, is full of gamblers, and unfortunately, my father was one.

My father worked in the department of agriculture but couldn't save none. When I was around 14 years old, my father sold our house for only five lakh rupees, my mother battled everyday, reached out to people to convince him not to but nobody helped and I didn't understand anything about it, neither did my elder sister who was 17 at the time.

He never encouraged us to study and the neighborhood didn't inspire it either and consequently we hardly cleared our matriculation. After that, no college for us.

It was around 2012 when I got my first cell phone which was a Chinese phone with a 2g network (took 40 mins or something to download a 4mb song), with that phone, I taught myself everything I know, I can safely say I learned from that phone more than what I learned in school. 

I started confronting my father when I turned 17 or something about what he did to us and he always said things like, ""I don't earn for you, I earn for myself"", ""when I die, you'll get enough money from the government to build a house and live happily"".

Which wasn't true. My father died back in 2017 and now we're told to leave the quarter. They let us live for two years but not anymore.

I was never forced to go out and work and with a 10 pass certificate, I'm not going to find any work either. Shit has hit the fan. We got some 15 lakh from the office and paid 2.5 lakh for some loan he had, now with that little budget we can't imagine building a house in this age, plus my sister is unmarried.

I love my mother so much, I loved my father as well despite what kind of a person he was, he was my father nevertheless. But my mother, she's my life. If it wasn't for my mother, i would've ended this life.

My relatives stopped calling us a year later my father's death lest we ask them for help.

It's just 3 of us now, nobody comes to our house anymore, my father's work colleagues who used to treat me like a son now passes me by like I'm some stranger.

Life is bleak with no hope in sight. I'm soon to be 24 with no prior experience in work. I've been told to move out of the town but i can't imagine living my mother and sister in a place where there's no one to take care of them.

I dream about 3 of us killing ourselves. I hope it doesn't come to pass.

My father never let me work, not even go to market and get groceries because he thought I'm a fool, i can't use money. I squandered my life away. I work in our locality but it's not work in the traditional sense, i just help out people for little to no money.

What can I do? I don't hope to make my mother proud, I just want a stable life and always be there for my mother.

My nearest city is Guwahati. There I might my some work but again, can't leave them here and I a city like Guwahati, where average rent is 10k+, all of us can't move there either.

How do I make thing work, how do I make myself work?

How do you go out and find work? I have no real world experience. I used to have a really good friend, thought he was my best friend but that's not true. He stopped hanging out with me.

I play ludo with my mother and sister to keep them distracted of our imminent dark days.

(B.Tech) . Need help!,"Alright so I couldn't get into the top tier institutes last year, but I am not discouraged. Instead, I'm willing to work my ass off to grab a good paying job.

College Branch: CSE

It'll be my second year in this college when it opens in July

The field I'm interested in is Data Science. Although, I don't know if freshers can get such jobs.

I know a little bit of C/C++ (taught in college) and a fair bit of python.

What I need right now is for someone to kind of cross check my routine/timetable so I'd at the very least know what I'm doing wrong or missing something. 

This is the plan I've thought of:

About 30% in learning something out of maths/python/college courses/data science courses. 

40% in practicing/learning Open Source/git/github

20% in competitive coding. Basically following this roadmap  [https://careerhigh.in/roadmap/9/](https://careerhigh.in/roadmap/9/)

Remaining 10% in immersing myself into the data science world by reading articles/watching videos and browsing other useful websites concerning the IT sector.

My academic goals: 

Overall: Maintain a good CGPA(8+)

2019: To get a feel of competitive coding and become adept at open source.

2020: To start participating in coding competitions, crack GSoC, and start preparing for interviews for internships.

2021:To do a little bit of Open Source and competitive programming and focus mainly on internship in summer and placements later. 

Some specific questions:

1. Is the above time-table/routine viable for these goals? Can I expect to achieve all of my goals?
2. Can I get a data science job as a fresher from a tier 3 college? 
3. Should I start off as a regular Software Engineer and then switch to data science after some years of experience? If so then should I be spending more time on Competitive Programming rather than Open Source?
4. I've heard that I'll need to build a good portfolio to even get interviews. What are some examples of things I could put onto my portfolio apart from GSoC and Competitive Programming achievements. Is LinkedIn used for this stuff?
5. I've also heard that making projects is a great way to get experience and learn a lot of things. Can I also put these on my portfolio? If yes then what should the scale/size be of such projects? I've made a couple of python scripts to kind of automate some tasks but they are hardly 10 lines long. 
6. Do I even need to practice Competitive Programming or DS/Algo to get a good paying job in the data science sector?
7. What do students at the very top institutes study/practice/learn? IIT Bombay has arguably the best students in India but it's not even in [this](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2018/06/google-summer-of-code-2018-statistics-part-2.html) list. What things do they do in their summer breaks, or the whole year for that matter, to get an edge over students of other colleges?
8. When do I start applying for internships that I'll be doing after my 3rd year ends. I'm pretty sure companies don't visit my college for internships at the starting of 3rd year. How soon should I start applying myself?
9. How would a proper internship fare against working under an IIT professor in the summer after 3rd year?
10. Again, is it viable to think I'll get a data science internship in Summer 2021?
11. What backup plan should I keep if I can't crack GSoC in 2020 ? The selected students are announced in the first week of May. Will that be too late to apply for internships for Summer 2020? Will I even have any relevant skills by then?

Thanks a lot for reading this far. Normally, these questions should've been discussed with my seniors in college but there's nobody wanting to achieve anything great in this college. I could've scored a lot more in JEE last year but there were some reasons way beyond my control that hindered my learning and performance.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 29 year old female currently working as an ad-hoc English professor in a Delhi University college. I've been working in this position for the last 5 years. I've had to shift from one college to the next (worked in 4 colleges so far) because vacancies are limited. I would sometimes be hired against a leave vacancy, and when the professor would come back, I would have to leave. Or sometimes I would be forced to leave because of a change in policy (such as right now when the EWS quota ate into general seats).

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly, after 5 years, I see no chance of landing a permanent job in Delhi University anytime soon. Being forced to move from one college to the next because of factors beyond my control, and despite great reviews from colleagues and students alike has been demoralizing.

&amp;#x200B;

I've thought long and hard about this, but I think I really need a career change. Just that I don't know where to start or where I can apply my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

I have an MPhil in English from Delhi University. I was within the top 3 ranks across BA, MA, and MPhil. I have several publications and will present a paper at an international conference in October. 

&amp;#x200B;

Incidentally, I also have three offers for a PhD from top UK universities. I couldn't go, however, since I could get only partial funding. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also married and my husband is paid well-enough that I don't have any immediate financial worries.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, what should I do? Should I:

&amp;#x200B;

* Grind it out in Delhi University and hope to land a permanent job (while getting a PhD from DU/JNU)
* Cough up the cash for a PhD from UK (we're talking 80L-1cr over 3 years)
* Switch careers completely and change to a new field. Maybe even do an MBA?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm leaning more and more towards option #3. But in that case, what kind of places will hire me? Think tanks? Research foundations? How do I go about finding a job in these places? 

&amp;#x200B;

Would it be wiser to just do an MBA (I have strong quant skills and a 330 score in GRE) and use that to change careers?

Please help me out.
I have a small family run fabric business in Chennai.
I have had two workers working in my shop. One was working for 15 years and other for 7 years.
They do minor fabric cutting job as well as cleaning the premises.
No documents etc is involved since they are working on oral commitments.
They have been very lax with their work for last five years but since we don't have other options, we tolerated them.
Ever since my father got sick, I was totally immersed in his well being and had to skip days at shop while my brother managed it by himself. 
The market being weak, we could not give them raise this year but a bonus of one month salary was given.
One is given 15k, other is given 13k.
They both took advantage of situation and walked out saying either you increase the salary by 1.25 times or they are quitting.
After few days they both returned since they couldn't find employment anywhere else.
I agreed to keep both for old amount for a month and told them that if they are able to get better options, they can leave anytime but from now on, I could only pay them 10k each.
In the meantime, my father passed away ladt week. 
On 1st July, I had 20k with me , so I thought I'll atleast give them immediately so they can meet their expenses atleast.
After taking 10k each, they both refused to continue and one threatended me with violence.
Today I recieved a call asking for 1 lakh settlement for him working for so many years.
I'm confused as how to deal with it.
Your advice will be really appreciated.

My name Is Nicklas I come from Denmark, but that's irrelevant. I’m doing some research on Abhinav Bindra - possibly for a video biography.

I am here because I want to know how big of an influence Abhinav Bindra has had (and possibly still has?) on India. How did his Olympic gold medal in 2008 impact the country? I’ve read his book, but I want to hear some personal accounts and experiences. How could the everyday Indian feel the impact of this event - if any? Was it celebrated nationwide? How did it impact the culture? Did anything change? How significant was this day in 2008 - and the man?

I've had only one serious relationship in my whole life and that was a decade ago. That lasted for 5 years. It was in short the best as well as the worst period of my life. She was forgiving and I was an entitled idiot. We both had problems but we were so similar in thinking things through that we sailed past all of it untill distance drew us away. We fell out of love. We broke up. Took me a year to move on. Fast forward 5 years to the present now. After a string of dates  with some wonderful people and some amazing friends I learned to love myself and even quit my job to fund my master's.
Back to college, I'm in a class of 5(specialisation) which has 1 girl. This girl(24 F) is the best. She won Ms Freshers and won every Athletic competition held out there. She is beautiful and wholesome. Problem is she is from a family of Jats and her dad's like double my height and has allegedly gone to jail for murdering people. She has been in one serious relationship and that guy was using her. She gets proposals everyday. Coming back to me, I've topped the class and is second in the university..I have conducted conferences successfully and am a complete opposite of what I was during graduation. I've become more outgoing and that definitely was a factor for both of us getting attracted to each other in some way. We have become each others biggest confidants and I've bared my heart to her. She respects and finds me intriguing for some reason.
Now coming to the problem? I'm ready to settle down with her but she ain't( she hasn't explicitly said no but she was honest about it yet she disapproves when I even glance at a woman silently) . She wants to settle with whomever  her parents  get her yet she is terrified of the prospect of marrying someone she doesn't know. She wants to enjoy freedom because she was never ever allowed to even leave her state to travel to any other place.  I don't have any patience left and I have to be with her for one more year( untill I complete my post-graduation) whether I like it or not. I have no lack of women hitting on me or being flirtatious. She is the naivest person I have ever known.(One of the reasons I like her). She is a Jat and I'm a a Christian from Kerala( her dream destination in India). She is rich and I'm upper middle class. I don't believe in religion and she does to some extent. We both are in Mumbai now (internship) for a month and I've no clue what to do next.

I study in class 11(NonMed)and i am finding the syllabus waaay too hard for me to digest. I can write long paragraphs describing my problems but instead I'm summing them up in few points:
1.I just can't concentrate. 
2.How do i catch up with all of the syllabus 
3.How do i get all of  the distractions out?




I really underestimated class 11. 
I scored decently well in 10th boards but the studying lattern I've been following for past years seems to be breaking up. 
In the begging everything was going fine but past couple of weeks have been pretty messy to say the least. The syllabus is moving way to fast and I'm unable to match the pace. Part of the reason might just be all of these distractions all around me. Whenever i try to sit down and study i think weather i should study the older stuff which i haven't perfected or should i study what teacher taught today. I get pretry overwhelmed thinking about this and end up using phone and scrolling through twitter,watching pointless videos on YouTube or playing Counter strike.
I've realised that something needs to be done fast.

I'm guessing we all know someone like this. Someone who does minor unethical or illegal things and justifies them by saying ""Itna to chalta hai"" because there are always bigger offenders. It seems like a very Indian thing because there's always a bigger fish in India.

Some examples of such behavior would be:

* Copying assignments in school / college
* While driving, overtaking from the wrong side, parking in a no parking area for ""just 10 minutes""
* Not wearing seatbelt / helmet
* Being just a little late - 5/10 minutes, every time
* Littering, spitting, not flushing etc.
* Not declaring complete income for taxes
* Other minor things like not ordering food but eating bites from everyone else

None of these in isolation can be called out because they're minor in comparison to much bigger offenders - corrupt politicians, copied movies, drunk driving etc. 

However, I see this as a pattern in some people. Like if someone is douchey in one aspect of life they are also douchey in other aspects. IMO the cumulative effect of such behavior would be significant even if they all seem like victimless crimes on their own.

I am 31, male, currently working in US. I recently got out of a relationship that was going nowhere and have been feeling great and free after the breakup. However, some people around me like to remind me that I am a loser for not being 'settled' yet. And this is not some direct insult as well. It comes in form of subtle concerns such as ""Oh, people will start thinking there is something wrong with you"" and shit. Geez, relax you fucking 'relatives'. I am 31, not 80. Even 80 year olds are dating and finding partners. I want to take time and focus on myself and my hobbies. Who cares what age I settle in or even not settle for that matter. I may find someone I want to marry at 35,40,45 or not at all. Does it diminish any joy in life? Hell no! Yeah, sometimes it feels like it would be nice to have a partner, but it's foolish to think about what you don't have rather than what can be enjoyed right now. Even though I logically understand that I will be just fine and hopefully find a partner in future, this judgement by relatives (and sometimes even friends) undermines my confidence and makes me think that I should get 'settled' first before enjoying life.

So the following day, I went to apply for a photocopy and reassessment. Fast forward to 3 July, the photocopy came and with it, joy. It was clear at first glace that it was a correction error, and i just needed 3 marks to pass. Now, here's where the trouble began. The online portal for B. Tech admission has been opened and its last date for registration is 17 july. And my result is gonna come on 23 july. This 1 week gap is just a shitstorm of disappointment. I dont know what to do.

Specifically any ***complications in voltages and safety*** of appliances is appreciated.  


In addition to Indian sockets type D and (fits two pin type C), I am thinking of adding equal number of European sockets (type F, also fits two pin type C). I really like the safety features of European plugs with hidden contact pins, ground connection first as well as those fancy child safe sockets with shutters. Lots of equipment will not even have jacketed contact plugs, which is changing in the last decade. Also more equipment, including TV's are going two pin plugs unless they have metal housing, and I guess thats to use the same plugs for more markets.  
Getting power cables for different sockets wrt Laptops, or any detachable cable inlets is the easiest part of the problem, and most appliances are rated for 220-250V or 100-250V shouldn't cause any problems.  


The bulb sockets are a little complicated, as the smart-home scene grows in India more providers continue to make the only two sockets used widely and there's no real use of using the E27.

I wonder if anyone here is interested for some regular games in the Real Time Strategy genre of gaming related to modern warfare themes.
Strangely I have observed that this fantastic and the most well made RTS game is somehow less explored/ less advertised or less played by Indian gamers.
I think people interested in the strategy genre of gaming should know about it and come together to build up the strategy gaming community in our country.
We have legendary gamers in all other genre of gaming except RTT. Lets master this genre aswell. This is a humble callout to all the  gaming geniuses and every other  aspiring professional gamers in India. Lets fill this gap and make the Indian gaming community proud!

Gamers please comment and let us connect if interested. Mind you the game in consideration is tough and has a steap learning curve. Its challanging.

Hi - I am currently a 3rd year student studying CS outside India. I left India to do my undergrad. 

As I enter the last year of my undergrad, I am still not sure on how to deal with what happens after I graduate. 

I could get a job in the country I am in right now (this would be easier for me than most people because I already have some work experience in the field and am pretty confident about converting it into a job, possibly a good one), apply for a permanent residency and become a citizen eventually. 


This would make my life a lot easier in terms of Visa issues etc. 

Or I could move back to India. My parents are fine with this because I would be closer to them. I definitely care about my parents but am also ambitious and career-oriented and I am not sure if the Indian workplace environment is particularly conducive to do well. But eventually I do plan to start something of my own and have been exploring these options and India has a lot of potential in terms of starting something of my own. I could be completely wrong though. ( but I see YC and other accelerators making a lot of India-focused investments)



Questions. 
I am not from a metro in India and have no experience living in a metro in India. What’s the quality of life there?

How is a good workplace in India for someone career-oriented?

I am fortunate enough that my parents have done we for themselves so there is no pressure to send money to them at least for the foreseeable future, but how do I ensure that I plan well in terms of finances considering my situation?


Finally, is it realistic to invest back home with the money I make here. Even savings accounts in India give better returns than here.

Have a look at the question asked [here](https://boxofficeindia.com/report-details.php?articleid=5202) and the answer of BoxOfficeIndia editors on Sacred Games' popularity (or lack of it). Just highlighting some of the things they say:  

&amp;#x200B;

*Q: Sacred Games is having a second part despite it being very bad and practically unwatchable...*

*A: India does not patronize this sort of stuff and* ***Netflix audience in India*** ***watches foreign programs not the sub standard Indian stuff***.....Netflix knows what is going to grow subscriber base and its not Sacred Games for sure. Its ***actual very good this sort of rubbish like Sacred Games goes to digital*** *otherwise we would have to bear toned down versions in cinemas. ......This is just a second part there could be another one but eventually when its not working it will die.....Sacred Games is like the Sahib Biwi Aur Gangster of digital as that film had three parts despite no one really watching any of the films. Of course it* ***may be talked well off but what comes out of the mouth and actually having watchers is two different things.***  

&amp;#x200B;

Now I have heard that the website is a key source to assess commercial performances of movies and I also understand that maybe Sacred Games doesn't qualify as commercial success but I am genuinely curious who are these people, and have they literally been living in caves not to acknowledge the fact that this is the content a lot of us liked and want....

Hi,

Looking to purchase a laptop for programming, watching movies and browse the web. The following configuration seem good, just needed reviews for the same.

 The Asus one seems to have a bad panel but people who own the laptop how bad is it?

The Hp one has a 3 cell battery, IPS LED backlit panel on paper this should translate as better battery life and better display but does it? 

I  can't find information regarding if the HP laptop allows storage to be updated or the SSD is soldered to the laptop. 

The Acer laptop seems good on paper any comments on how good or bad it is ?

&amp;#x200B;

I plan to dual boot have Ubuntu and Windows 10. Any driver issues for Ubuntu I need to be aware off ?

The old laptop I had had a Broadcom Wifi &amp; Bluetooth modules had issues with Ubuntu and needed a bit of effort to get them working.

How is the battery back up of all 3 laptops on Ubuntu ?

Please don't suggest me to get a Mac as the Mac's I am looking for are far far away from my budget.  :(",cccbsr,,false,/r/india/comments/cccbsr/laptop_suggestions_please_help/,AskIndia

I began thinking that why it always happens that only women are oppressed. We say that in God's eyes, all beings are equal, but did god knowingly did that or did we made our society filthy by doing this to fulfill our needs.   
Another thing which came to my mind was why all abusive words start with mother and sister only, why we do not use father and brother's name as abusers for this purpose. I asked my father this question and he replied that he also don't know the answer to this weird question, but maybe people respect their mothers and sisters more, so to hurt others' feelings, they use these disrespectful words against each other.  
I also know that nowadays, with the advent of advanced technology and intellectual minds, we're living in a modern world, but I don't think that things have changed in comparison to early times, mainly in our country India.   
Our country is still pretty much the same. Although we are developing at a rapid pace our mindsets are still very narrow.  
Child rape is so common in our country, but we are still busy doing fighting petty clashes over religious issues. People are beaten or criticized just from being a particular religion, but not for being a rapist or criminal.  
We nowadays have so many organizations like Bajrang Dal, RSS, VHP, etc. who just shout God's name and beat fellow citizens for not saying their God's name. And the most astonishing thing is that our youth also fascinates and supports their activities.  
We don't have any large group or organization fighting to stop or criticize these heinous crimes.  
The most amusing thing is people are busy fighting for the rights of Imaginary Gods and they have completely forgotten to fight and claim the rights of their fellow beings.  
On the other hand, people with no mental balance at all are still roaming among us raping and contriving crimes with children and woman.

Since there is a news about water scarcity on daily basis, I was thinking again about rain harvesting to manage my household requirement of water from rainwater only. I've read about someone in Bangalore doing it successfully, but it seems difficult for a common man.

 [http://www.forbesindia.com/blog/life/bangalores-rain-catcher-the-man-who-never-payed-for-water/](http://www.forbesindia.com/blog/life/bangalores-rain-catcher-the-man-who-never-payed-for-water/) 

I request everyone to share knowledge upon this. If I can install such system at my home successfully, I'm hoping to do it for all houses in my Mohalla.

**My past experience:** We were living in a poor colony. Authorities used to supply piped water only for 5-10 min daily at 4 AM with very slow speed. Since the quantity and speed was very less, if anyone hooked it with electric motor it would suck all the water leaving everyone else without water in the colony. So we used to hook a portable handpump at 4 AM and filled buckets manually then took them to main tank. And repeated this again. It was very tiring physical process which made me a very cautious water consumer. It was my best water conservation learning, carry it till the date. You leave open a tap anywhere and my heart will skip a beat.

So during rainy season, we'd skip first one or two rains (acidic rain or what-not), clean the roof and then block all sink points on roof except one. Rainy water was stored in a tank from there. Raint water would not spoil for months and we used to take it as drinking water, it had a very sweet/different taste. On the other hand if piped water got mixed with rainy water, there'd be small worms in it within days.

I feel this process was not hygenic and efficient.

If anyone has any experience in this field. I would appreciate if I can find a cheapest method to install (think of tier-2/3 town cheap).",ccfv92,,false,/r/india/comments/ccfv92/rainwater_harvesting_at_home_experience_and_best/,AskIndia

AIR POLLUTION causes **IRREVERSIBLE LUNG DAMAGE,** which results into many different things in human body.

**How do you measure pollution inside your house?**

I have a friend who got involved with and recently became engaged to a man from India, and there are some concerns that have arisen.  We (our circle of friends) have only met the man once, and even then it was brief and we didn't really learn much about him. We have a number of concerns, but she has assured us that these a just cultural differences and are the norm for Indian culture as he has explained them to her, but I'd really like to fact check some of his points. The whole thing seemed to happen very suddenly and move very quickly, and the situation is a bit mysterious and complex, so maybe it's best to just go point by point.

- Firstly, they met on Tinder. It seemed to start as a casual hook up date, and they did have sex on the first date.
- After the initial hook up, they began formally dating a month or so later.
- After things became more serious, she said she loved him. He did not (would not) say it back to her. There was no explanation to this given for several months.
- The relationship continues, but eventually she expresses concern with why he won't say I love you. He became frustrated, and said in his religion (Hindu) he is not allowed to say I love you until he is engaged. Shortly after this, he proposes.
- He states that his religion requires him to become engaged after about 6 months or so of dating.
- She is not Hindu and has no intention of converting, which he knows. However he previously told his parents in India that she was Hindu, then backtracked and said that she will convert after they are married. 
- He is here on a student visa which will expire very soon. 

Their wedding is coming up soon and we're all concerned for her. She's committed to the engagement, but I can't help but feel unsure about this man's intentions. There appear to be some paradoxes in his piety, and there are some points about the specifics of his religious obligations that I am having trouble confirming through research, so I'm asking here, are we all right to be concerned?",ch4ucg,,false,/r/india/comments/ch4ucg/questions_from_an_outsider/,AskIndia

is it just people being senselessly competitive?

I've  decided to take drop and try for jee mains in January and April again next year even tho I haven't scored enough in boards(64% aggregate,  54.9% in pcm) for iits/nits/iiits but am still eligible for decent engineering colleges like:-

DTU, New Delhi (through jee mains+ JAC)

COEP, pune (through MHT-CET)

RVCE, Bangalore (through COMED-K)

VJTI, mumbai (through MHT-CET/JEE MAINS + DTE COUNSELING)

DAIICT, GUJRAT (through jee mains)

and everyone's  fav MIT,Manipal (through MU-OET).

Now  my parents want to (and I mean really in a very toxic manner) send me to a local shitty private engineering college(where ofcourse uniform and 75% attendance is mandatory), and prepare myself for coding independantly(lol) because a relative of mine (who is from iit-kharagpur ofc) told them to, and then do masters from some US college(which won't  happen if I join said shitty college for Btech). And I really want to  have a decent job after my bachelor's before I decide my further education,atleast for a while.

The thing is I want to enjoy my college life(I guess?) a bit and actually have a decent chance at good job prospects in the future, plus I'm still a bit unsure whether chasing engineering would be a good idea for a lazy student like me but hell I can do something my parents wish for me to do. Also will try my hand at IELTS and reach for foreign colleges in  europe (less expensive than US and Australia), tho that seems unlikely since my parents are unwilling in that matter.

So  fellow redditors, please give me some insights/opinions on whether I'm making a sound decision or not,and if yes, how shall I prepare for JEE MAINS since I haven't touched a book for months and really have not much guidance as of now. I would also like to know if preparation for JEE would be enough for other entrance examinations like MUOET, COMED-K, etc.  Also I would really like to self study and avoid coachings (never could use them to an advantage), and amount of books shouldn't be a problem. I'm also weak in chemistry and my math concepts (a majority of them) are  terribly fucked. I'm willing to put in the hours tho promise (even tho I'm prone to mood swings and demotivation, but my career is on the line, hell my life is). I'm 17 and just passed my boards this year if it matters. So PLEASE help me and thank you for your suggestions.

Sorry for the formatting as I typed this on the mobile app, and also I meant no offence to anyone going to any engineering college, it's just my elder friends really warned me about their situation and they were Frank af  with me so I thought the wording shouldn't be very offensive, but if it is I'm really sorry, and thanks again:)

Edit: by eligible I meant my board Marks are enough for mentioned colleges and that I need to improve my jee rank (hence why I wanted to take a drop). I'm not actually eligible for iits/nits/bits etc. Due to low percentage in board exams.

Does anyone know how to hire English speakers in India for internet based jobs? Is there a Craigslist equivalent?  Any ways of contacting locals without going out to directly recruit?

(1/2) UPDATE\* Basically - I'm looking to outsource an emailing job that is very simple, but too complicated for automation. I'd send out a list of emails, and the employee must send out prewritten emails to those people. The employee would have to choose which email to send based on the size of a company - so a bit of research is involved. I would like to pay hourly, but with a bonus for every time a client purchases via the email. Work as much or as little as you want remotely.

(2/2) UPDATE\*  

Short Job Description: We are a start-up company in the United States that offers marketing services to small and medium-sized businesses. We need to hire more sales team members to email lists of potential clients about our services. Once a potential client responds, we will take the conversation from there. Very easy. Work as little or as much as you like. For high performing employees that have excellent English grammar, there will be more work available within the company.

Payment: We are looking to structure a performance-based system. A low (but fair) hourly rate + substantial bonuses for each client that purchase our services. 

Interested applicants:  Please send name, email, expected pay (a range that you would like to make), and how you prefer to receive payment.",chk8e7,,false,/r/india/comments/chk8e7/does_anyone_know_how_to_hire_english_speakers_in/,AskIndia

These days we see a lot of 'sting operations' and videos of politicians etc etc.

But what I wanted to know was whether a normal person can get a video/audio recording of a statement by a person in secret and then use it against them in court when they deny it 

For example - Suppose a woman is giving false rape/harrasment case against a guy. And in person she says - Beta ab tu dekh, Meri toh har koi sunega lekin Teri koi nahi sunega. The guy says - But it's false !
The girl says- yeah prove karke Bata. Koi yakeen nahi karega 

And badam, unknowing to girl, this was recorded by a small camera/audio device. Now my curious ques is whether it can be used in court as an evidence of the women lying as she herself admitted to it. 

Or will the video/audio be discarded on the ground of not being consensual? 

Please tell. Thank you

So this guy wanted a service from me and for one month he kept dillydallying and making laaaarge phone calls. Finally a few days ago we hashed out payment terms and I sent him details and asked him to pay by that evening otherwise I would need to cancel his appointments as my time slots are limited. He then made an about-turn and said ""I am a bit surprised by tone of your message and find it demanding. Looks like we have hit an impasse. You are free to act as you deem fit."" This dude had a whole spiel about how his mum died of cancer and he had bills of 7.5 lakh every month on an income of 2.5 lakh and how he values relationships because he is a Gujarati and blah blah blah. Like we're talking half an hour phone calls a couple times a week.

This dude had wasted quite a bit of my time and I was upset. I shot off an email:

""Please do not play victim all the time, it ill behoves an adult to do so. I must admit I am shocked by your behaviour and attitude as I have not experienced this in the past with others. If you do not pay for a service or a product, you cannot legally obtain it. You are unfortunately mistaken in your assumptions, there is NOTHING strange, shocking or demanding about this, in fact, that is how all organisations work; it's how the entire world works. I was under the impression that you would have been aware of this global fact, but now I suppose I was mistaken in that assumption. I have respectfully asked you many times to pay the fee if you want the lessons, but it appears you wish to take me for a ride and play with my time. I am not asking for something unusual when I ask for a fee payment on the 24th when your lesson was to start on the 27th at 6.45AM in the morning (per YOUR special requests), and I do not understand why you feel so offended every time we talk about the financial aspect of this service. It's especially strange because when we spoke a few days ago you were quite happy to mention that my fee wasn't a big amount for you. I have every right to cancel lessons that people refuse to respectfully pay for.

Just to be clear, I am not registered as a charitable organisation, and I am taxed on all profits every year. I have an aging mother and pets to single-handedly support and bills to pay. I've had a much-loved pet die of a long-fought battle with cancer ; my mum had faced domestic violence; my childhood was fraught with instability. I empathised with your situation but most people have been through things equally bad, if not worse; you're not the only one. However, you will never hear me saying that to anyone to drum up support or get people to perform favours for me because I don't believe in airing such matters publicly or using past personal traumas for favours. Most people don't, if we're being honest.

And yes, I was also very surprised by the total and complete lack of response to any of my messages. I found it highly disrespectful, especially because you were the one who asked for the bank details and said you would pay the fee a day before I sent the details. Please develop respect for another person's time and effort (and this really applies to every person, not just me); I work sixteen hours a day. If you were only looking for free advice and tests for you and your wife, you could've been clear about that instead of wasting a professional's time with endless sob stories, long calls and spiels about values &amp; relationships (that were completely unnecessary).

I went above and beyond to accommodate you and your wife's special requests for time slots (that I usually never accept - I only start at 7.30AM and my last lesson ENDS at 11PM, and yet, because I wanted to HELP you and your wife, I accepted your requests for a different time) and flexibility, but you chose to be rude and disrespectful. Trust me, there is absolutely no need for me to accept 4 or 5 installments or a request for out-of-hours time slots as I am always fielding class requests from keen students who are happy to do as I say. However, you chose not to be appreciative of the generous offers I extended to you. I guess I learnt a valuable and priceless lesson about trusting people who come in with tearjerkers as a bargaining tool! I thank you for it.

I am not sure if Canadian society would be accepting of such an attitude, to be honest; it's a high-trust society and I reckon you would find it difficult to fit in and be successful in that society if this is a general pattern of behaviour. It might not be worth it to expend so much time, energy and money into emigrating in such a case if you would only have to return. (Immigration agencies will never tell you that a not-insignificant percentage of those who do go there eventually have to return for a variety of reasons, the biggest one being the inability to fit in or be accepted by others, whether for work or a social life). At this stage, with the current situation that you face with your case, scores, and time limit, it would be worth it to reconsider the move.

Good luck with the exam and on your future endeavours.

Here is what I got back:

""Your personal remarks against me are derogatory, and uncalled for. Needless to say, this has drawn my lawyers attention to pursue legal recourse under civil proceedings. I advise you to unequivocally apologise for your distasteful remarks.""

What should I do? I honestly do not think it's derogatory and afaik there is nothing legal he can really do I mean, what? I didn't even curse. Sounds ridiculous to me.

I spoke to her sometimes over whatsapp, about mundane academic stuff. Nothing that would make it seem like we're very good friends or anything. We never hung out or for that matter spoke too much IRL

Apparently she has taken a liking to me, and has begun to send me lots of massive texts. This is very inconvenient since I am preparing for GRE and I spend my days in college library studying. Whenever I turn on my data in the middle of the day, I'll have 9-10 messages from her. They're pretty mundane texts too, about what happened during the day and the things she's worried about. Its almost like i'm her boyfriend/best friend without my consent, and she'll pour out her heart to me when I just don't care.

I give her very small replies, just enough to not sound rude. I have even gone far enough to tell her that her texts are disturbing me, and I have no interest in the things she sends me. She promised to not do it, yet I woke up today to 24 unread messages. Its like she just doesn't get it. If I don't open her messages, she'll send me an SMS asking to ""please reply""

She is a classmate and we've spoken normally in the past, which is why I am reluctant to block her or completely cut her off, because I don't wish to make things awkward in the classroom.

The culture surrounding work emphasizes *being at work* and *appearing to work*, but actual level of productivity is less important. It's more important that your butt is in the chair for 10 hours a day than that you're productive. This is why despite the long hours, [Japan has a very low level of productivity](https://www.tokyoreview.net/2018/07/japan-productivity-overwork/):

&gt;The problem is that for Japan, productivity isn’t the point. The professional culture is input-based (full schedules of meetings, onerous paperwork and menial tasks, and similar) rather than output-based, where long hours and late nights are a less a means to accomplish tasks and more of a means of value-signaling, demonstrating devotion to the organization and commitment to the team members. That isn’t unique to Japan – any visitor to Washington, DC will notice people boasting of their lifespan-shortening work regimens – but what’s unique to Japan is prioritizing the effort made over concrete results. There are two reasons why the problem is so pernicious.

I was wondering if this work culture would also apply to India. I know very little about Indian work culture. Does it similarly emphasize appearance and the ""ritual"" of work, over raw productivity?",ce5rgh,,false,/r/india/comments/ce5rgh/question_for_indians_would_you_say_that_the/,AskIndia

Hi [r/india](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/),

I need to find out some information about the powers, structure and management of local government in rural india.

&amp;#x200B;

**Background:** I work at a UK water company and am working on an extra-curricular charity project with WaterAid. Part of this project is to 'develop a strategy to reduce open-defecation in rural communities.' Specifically we are focusing on the district of *Bhadrak*. We are able to make use of volunteers in the area, small amounts of cash provided to each village where twin-pit toilets have been installed (about $100 per village), medical/health care centres/professionals, community groups and schools.

&amp;#x200B;

I won't go into detail of root causes of open defecation, as I'm sure anyone in India would be fully aware, but briefly the root cause is that in rural communities it is the cultural and behavioural norm to defecate in the open. Reasons such as believing toilets to be unhygienic, not wishing to share with in-laws, men not wanting to 'hide their shame', not wanting to do the work of emptying toilet pits are a few. The problems this leads to are multiple health and economic issues as well as huge risk of violence against women.

&amp;#x200B;

So far we have strategies to educate, inform etc etc using the volunteers via all the channels we have available to us (classroom activities, women's group education and discussion, medical practitioners discussing defecation when they meet patients and so on). However our overall goal to tie it all together is to get locals who support hygienic toilet use to petition for a Gram Sabha on the issue. It's my understanding that 10% of  18+ villagers (or 50 villagers, whichever is higher) are needed in order for this to happen . The overall strategy is based on influencing people through each of these opportunities, find champions to support the idea and petition for Gram Sabha. Then, *I don't know what we should be aiming for from there?*

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is what powers does the Gram Sabha/Gram Panchayat have. I understand the basic structure of local government, but *we need to figure out what we actually want to come out of Gram Sabha. What could they do to help fight this issue?*

&amp;#x200B;

**Local Government:**

\- How much funding do they get and how much can they spend on non-centralised (local) projects

\- What powers does the local government have that can help incetivize changing behaviours

\- Are there community votes at Gram Sabha or are decisions made by entirely by government

\- Can decisions be made without Gram Sabha

\- Is a Gram Sabha releated to the issue of open defecation realistic?

\- What does the process of villagers petition for a Gram Sabha look like?

&amp;#x200B;

**Other questions you may like to help me with:**

\- How can you incentivize rural, religious communities to change their behaviour.

\- Are there any major issues I've missed leading to open-defecation in rural communities and how could we counteract them?

\- Do you live or know anyone in a rural community (or do you practice open defecation)? - ***I would love to speak to you***

\- Does anyone know of, or have ideas of, cheap retro-fit ideas for the twin pits (to improve accessibility for elderly/disabled people)

I would be very grateful for any help, insight or advice anyone can offer. I really feel like in order to develop a successful plan I need the perspective of people from India, so please help me! Thank you guys!

I am visiting Bhubaneswar and would like to know the whereabouts of a good laptop repairing shop.

~~Link in the comments regarding my problem.~~

This is  my laptop [https://www.msi.com/Laptop/GT60\_0NE/Specification](https://www.msi.com/Laptop/GT60_0NE/Specification) and around a year ago I was playing a game without charging my laptop on high settings and something happened

So on the December of 2018 I was playing Rainbow Six Siege on Medium to High Settings on my laptop while charging it and my neighborhood had a blackout . Since it is an online game and I couldn't pause nor save it I had to keep on playing and I was still playing that game even without charging my laptop. My laptop suffers from poor battery backup and hence I lost power to my laptop , closing the game abruptly and ever since I could no longer use my dedicated GTX680m GB ddr5 GPU and shows error code 43.

I've tried numerous ways to fix the laptop without having to open it(I've never opened it other than fiddling with the  battery ) and found out that after safely discharging all the electric build up (Pressing the power button for 60 seconds) and then starting my laptop without plugging in the charger, I could use and see my GPU (used GPU bench marking tools to confirm whether I could use my dedicated GPU or not )but if I plug in my charger, then there is a blue error screen, dedicated GPU driver vanishes and shows an yellow mark on my dedicated GPU hardware and my laptop turns off.

I went to my locale laptop dealer and he said there might have been a problem with the battery limiter or something but since he does not fixes laptops he advised me to go to some other place to have it checked and get it fixed.


So seeing that I am at an impasse here that I cannot use my laptop to game without having to plug in the charger to game for longer period of time and if I plug in my charger then I could not avail the usage of my dedicated GPU, I wanted to know what is my problem and could it be fixed or not. Anyways I will take my laptop to a better place to have it checked but still I would like to know about my problem and solutions regarding how to fix it.

When you're in class, does the teacher ever do this thing where they explain you something simple and mundane with a lot of passion and care, but rush through the genuinely hard concepts?

This is just something I never talked about. I'm in college and working so I don't interact with teachers at all. But I remember a few years ago in class 10/11, the Physics teacher spent like 30 minutes explaining how electromagnetic induction works, but then while solving some equation he all of sudden introduced the concept of definite integrals. I immediately asked him what that was, to which he did some funky hand waiving, implying it was not something worth worring about.

There are many more examples that I can say, but my point is that, teachers waste a lot of time telling us things that are obvious, things which don't need too much explanation because it's already found in our textbooks. But anything that's not in the book, like some new word or idea (I can usually tell what topic the teacher will be unwilling to expand on), or something that seems to invite private engagement (ahem, private tuition), they will ignore, as if even talking about that is a moral sin.

There's another thing I always wanted to ask you. When you were in school, did you have music periods and ""games"" period, which were essentially free periods? In my life, in 12 years they taught the students nothing about music. But on the fees book, the payment was divided into columns made for music and games and craft etc. We never got to do any of those things. But that's just my story. It probably is not the case in most schools.

I suggested that he use sites like Upwork to find freelance jobs like typing, subtitling etc. But frankly, I'm not sure he can work freelance jobs that well. His computer skills are okayish at best.

( Sorry state of Dentistry in India ),"After completing her Post Graduation in Orthodontics 2 years ago, my sister is struggling to find a Job.

Since then she has worked for free or peanuts ( 8k / month ) after studying almost 10 years for this degree. It's now more than a year and she is quite depressed about her job prospect ( after investing about 60 Lacs in a post-graduation ). I'm younger than her and have been working in tech field for almost 5 years. I do see a lot of opportunities  in  bioinformatics, have been involved in consulting few Startups helping them to set-up ML engine in addition to the work I do for my company. I've been trying to convince her to leave her field and learn programming.

She thinks that we need to give her more time and this field requires patience, although I feel that she is wrong and the situation is going to become much worse, as the number of students with MDS are going to increase. May be in future it might get stabilised once the BDS earns a house hold bad name, but it's a long time till then.

Correct me if I am wrong but I believe that Post Graduate degree  in Dentistry is worth Toilet paper, I think it makes sense only for people who have established clinics or deep pockets .

1. The rate at which water is wasted in India (due to breakage in pipes, overflowing government tankers, etc) is tremendous when considered holistically
2. The food might run out due to the surge in population and limited lands and farmers not getting paid enough to sustain their livelihoods
3. Air pollution due to unchecked emissions from factories and vehicles
4. Religious, racial and political issues
5. Tremendously increasing pressure on metro cities like Bangalore, Delhi and Mumbai
6. Government and government employees being their worst at their jobs. Add to that the ever-present corruption in almost anything

Consider all of these points and others that highly hurdle your life and living standards. Now consider how all of these things affect the poor who can't even get basic education and also the reservation system in government jobs. Like seriously, half of the country is facing water crisis and it is going to be worse in the coming years. Water is a basic resource and it might lead to people doing crazy shit for just water, which many of us waste. Pollution is increasing - air, water, noise, land. Waste management sucks, plastics clogs almost every sewer line in the country. Meanwhile, the government is busy dealing with issues like ""Mandir yahi banega"", Yogi Adityanath is burning tonnes of mango woods to kill global warming (dude doesn't know that burning produces carbon which is the main greenhouse gas). 

&amp;#x200B;

These are the main things that the government should be focussing on because these things only dictate our living standards. And if we keep on neglecting these things, then we are fucked in the long run.

reasons i currenlty hate my job(this project in specific):-

1.Team members do not explain things clearly they are all experienced i am new to this so it would take time for me to absorb all the things but they expect me to get it completed asap this causes me anxiety pressure and nervouseness

2. 12pm-9pm this shift+the location of my office is very shady no public transport after 8pm although company provides cab service but i would reach my home faster taking the public transport

3.My manager,he is annoying AF expects too much and never appreciates even if i try and always asks me to send daily status mail(idk what to send if one day theres no progress) 

4.The tech stack is outdated even though there is some Java but no real coding stuff its mainly testing or something like that

P.S. There is bond of 2 years as well,and if i don't pay the bond amount they won't give me a relieving letter(worried about this as it shouldn't be like i was unemployed for an year if i go for an interview somewhere else)

I am a cautious flyer so i decided to look up this airline since i had never heard of them before.

I was really shocked to find the amount of problems this company has had with regards to the engines on their new A320neo planes.

This article from 2018 shows that this is not a new problem faced by the planes engine configuration https://www.businesstoday.in/sectors/aviation/indigo-airline-engines-technology-error-egine-manufacturing/story/270547.html

This website which tracks Aviation Incidents and Accidents paints a horrible picture for the company in 2019

https://www.aeroinside.com/incidents/airline/indigo

With engine failures midflight occuring almost weekly!!

Should i be as concerned as i am or am i being stupid? The only alternative flights i could book is an Air India flight, is this company better? Anybody have any suggestions on what to do?

Muslim Personal Law is a direct violation of the constitution’s Article 15 and the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1968. Per this law, a son gets TWICE as much as a woman in inheritance, and *mahr*, which is essentially reverse dowry, is allowed.

I think just like the Special Marriage Act, we should have an option to choose a Uniform Civil Code over personal law for a short time period, and eventually phase out Personal laws.

Often in democracies, we overlook the importance of an able administrator - those who keep the wheels of motion turning thereby enabling the rest of people to fulfill their potential. Sheila Dixit was that; and more.

One may differ with her policies and implementations; one cannot but marvel at her tenacity. That rarest of rare quality which sometimes makes all the difference, especially when found in a politician.

Katheria was also present at the spot. 


BJP MP RS Katheria justified it by saying, ""My security did not attack toll plaza employees, they first attacked my ppl. Toll employees did not know other cars were part of my convoy, they thought some other car is slipping through behind mine. My security guard only fired in self defence. ""

Fire to save toll? Any cost comparison between the toll ans the bullet cost? Give the MPs prepaid toll card.. no free toll for anybody. 
I think this all was to save Rs50 (approx) toll ticket.

1562455384,[deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ca04m8/major_crisis_in_ka_government/,42,47,,,Major Crisis in KA Government,"The JDS - Congress coalition government in KA is in a major crisis. At least 10 Congress and 3 JDS MLAs have resigned in supposed protest against their respective parties. More resignations are expected.

The crisis is grave because several of those who resigned are senior leaders, ideologues not just opportunists.

None of these have joined BJP and have explicitly mentioned that their decision was not related to BJP.

The background context is that last election had no clear mandate. BJP won the largest number of seats but not enough to form a government. JDS and Congress formed a post-poll coalition and formed the government. But they were so incompatible that they could not even fight the LS elections united. Result BJP won landslide in LS polls.

Anyways this is a shocking development and points seriously to the extent of dysfunction in both Congress and JDS and their associates.

Veterans like Ramalinga Reddy (Congress) and Vishwanath (JDS) walking out is earth shattering in these parts of the world.

Water is scarce in some while there is too much flooding in others, there is traffic problem and congestion in some while there is housing and garbage issues in others. Or, it could be a combination of these things.

The responsibility of fixing these problems is of the representatives whom we choose and elect. But these days, I'm seeing a tendency to blame ""outsiders"" or people who come from other states to study, work, etc. for a city's problems. Trust me fellows, politicians love this blame game as it shifts the responsibility from them! But please don't fall in their trap. Ultimately, we are all Indians and this country belongs to all of us, from north to south and east to west. Don't let them divide and rule upon you.

1563186259,rahulthewall,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cdfqzk/on_july_31_the_final_list_of_assams_national/,79,147,,,"On July 31, the final list of Assam’s National Register of Citizens will be published. Close to 42 lakh residents of Assam will find out whether the state considers them Indian citizens.Those who do not make it to the final list may end up being indefinitely detained in detention centres.","# Background

The first National Register of Citizens was compiled in 1951, after the Census was completed that year. Since 2015, the state has been in the process of updating the 1951 register. One of the stated aims of the exercise is to identify so-called “illegal immigrants” in the state, many of whom are believed to have poured into Assam after the Bangladesh War of 1971. [1]

In 1979, about eight years after the war, the state saw an anti-foreigners’ agitation. Assamese ethnic nationalists claimed illegal immigrants had entered electoral rolls and were taking away the right of communities defined as indigenous to determine their political future. [1]

In 1985, the anti-foreigners’ agitation led by the All Assam Students’ Union came to an end with the signing of the Assam Accord. Under this accord, those who entered the state between 1966 and 1971 would be deleted from the electoral rolls and lose their voting rights for 10 years, after which their names would be restored to the rolls. Those who entered on or after March 25, 1971, the eve of the Bangladesh War, would be declared foreigners and deported. [1]

The National Register of Citizens now takes its definition of illegal immigrants from the [Assam Accord](https://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/98564/1/appendix.pdf) – anyone who cannot prove that they or their ancestors entered the country before the midnight of March 24, 1971, would be declared a foreigner and face deportation. [1]

# Eligibility Criteria [2]

* People whose names appear on the 1951 NRC.
* People whose names appear on any voter list in Assam up to March 24 midnight, 1971.
* Descendants of the above.
* People who came from Bangladesh between January 1, 1966, and March 24, 1971, registered themselves with the Foreigner Regional Registration Office and were declared by the Foreigner Tribunal as Indian citizens.
* All Indian citizens including their descendants who moved to Assam after March 24, 1971. (They need to furnish proof of residence in another part of the country as on March 24, 1971.)
* [People who can provide any among a slew of other admissible documents.](https://imgur.com/nfap9ZH.png)


# Exclusions

Of the 3.29 crore people who applied, 2.89 crore people made it to the draft published on July 30, 2018. But over 40.7 lakh were excluded, including [army veterans](https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/nrc-veteran-who-served-30-yrs-in-indian-army-excluded-from-citizen-list-118080200091_1.html), [government employees](https://www.firstpost.com/videos/india/of-no-fixed-abode-ex-govt-employee-in-a-fix-as-assam-nrc-leaves-him-out-includes-wife-and-daughter-5020441.html), [families of former presidents](https://scroll.in/article/888735/why-relatives-of-former-president-fakhruddin-ali-ahmed-are-not-on-assams-final-nrc-draft) and [Assam’s only woman chief minister](https://scroll.in/latest/889159/assams-lone-woman-chief-minister-not-included-in-final-draft-of-national-register-of-citizens). There is no official community-wise or district-wise data. But anecdotal evidence suggests Bengali-origin communities wee overwhelmingly affected. All those left out of the draft were told to make fresh claims to citizenship.[1]

**Over the past year, the NRC officials also accepted objection forms which allowed people to flag the inclusion of “ineligible persons” in the register. On June 26, 1.02 lakh applicants who had made it to the first draft were told they had been included erroneously. They also have prove citizenship all over again.** [1]

[Members of the All Assam Students’ Union have filed lakhs of indiscriminate objections on the inclusion of names that sound Bengali Muslim in the final NRC draft.](https://thewire.in/rights/assam-nrc-bengal-muslims-objections)

Over the next month, Scroll.in will bring you a series called **[The Final Count](https://scroll.in/topic/56205/the-final-count)**. It will tell the stories of those being counted in Assam, the anxieties triggered by the process, the vagaries of the state as it compiled the National Register of Citizens, the complex historical forces which brought it into being.

# What happens if your name isn't in the NRC?

Those who do not make it to the final list will have to appear before the Foreigners’ Tribunals of Assam. These quasi-judicial bodies were originally set up under the Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunal) Act of 1983. The law has since been struck down by the court but the tribunals persist, tasked with determining whether individuals being tried are foreigners and should be deported.[1]

# What happens if you lose your case in the foreigner's tribunal

Given that no repatriation treaty exists with Bangladesh, no one knows. They may be detained indefinitely in one of the [detention centres that Assam is building.](https://scroll.in/article/887351/assam-has-received-sanction-from-centre-to-build-a-detention-camp-for-foreigners)

# What Next?

* [BJP promised to extend NRC to every state in India in their election manifesto.](https://indianexpress.com/elections/bjp-election-manifesto-national-register-of-citizens-5664960/)
* [BJP MP Tejasvi Surya urges Centre to extend NRC to Karnataka](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/bjp-mp-tejasvi-surya-urges-centre-to-extend-nrc-to-karnataka-5823753/)

If Assam is any indication, over a billion people will be required to submit proof of their own identity as well as records to substantiate several generations of family history. And this will be done in a country where the state does not reach many of those who live within its borders, where many fall through the cracks of institutional records, where the story of a life and a generation is contained in local memory and personal relationships rather than in documents.[1]

# Role of Supreme Court [3]

[ Read about the multiple procedural irregularities that have characterised the Supreme Court’s NRC Case: the use of sealed covers, consequential decisions being taken in closed-door hearings, and the bench’s disturbing disregard for due process rights. In the course of this years-long proceeding, the Court has far exceeded its brief as the apex judicial organ of the country, with its repeated stress on deportations making it appear more executive-minded even than the executive: more the Supreme Deportation Authority rather than the sentinel on the qui vive. \[3\] ](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/in-the-court-of-last-resort/article25105456.ece)

The government set out a plan where detainees who had spent more than five years in detention centres were to be conditionally released. The conditions of release are so onerous that in my view, they rise to the level of being unconstitutional, but let us ignore that for the moment. The Court refused to accept this proposal as, in the opinion of the CJI, it amounted to sanctioning an “illegality”. [3]

There is no – no – law that authorises indefinite detention of an individual, whether citizen or foreigner. And if there was a law that did so, it would almost certainly be struck down as unconstitutional. On what basis, therefore, does the Court say that releasing detainees who have spent more than five years in detention would be endorsing an illegality? [3]

Here are some excerpts.


&gt; The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), on its part, combined its disavowal of consumerism with a fascination for technology, welfarism, and a strong state

.

&gt; BJP became sharply critical of the globalizing facets of the liberalization programme initiated by the Congress. Murli Manohar Joshi, with his famous quip of “computer chips, not potato chips"", spelt out the need to thwart economic globalization from subverting Indian culture


.

&gt; The Vajpayee government attempted to tread a cautious middle path, with the upgradation of India’s creaking infrastructure being its stated priority. (but) There was no question of rolling back the tide of deregulation and technological upgradation through foreign direct investment (FDI).

.

&gt; Consequently, despite the commitment to swadeshi in the National Democratic Alliance’s common programme, the opening up of India to global business was pursued quite actively in the Vajpayee years. But the motivation was entirely strategic—to thwart any bid to isolate India internationally and to prevent its portrayal as another rogue regime.

.

&gt; By the beginning of 2015, the government came to the grudging conclusion that the costs of its ambitious infrastructure improvement plans would have to be met through public expenditure.


.

&gt; Till 2015, the government had focused its energies on improving the ease of doing business and creating employment opportunities through “Make in India"" targeting foreign-owned companies. While these initiatives were neither abandoned nor diluted, the emphasis of the government’s messaging changed. Addressing the concerns of rural India and designing welfare schemes for the poor became the government’s paramount concerns.

.

&gt; In subsequent years, this partiality for the medium and small enterprise was extended by the BJP to freedom from excessive state regulations—the inspector raj—and demands for low taxation. Traders and small businesses, in fact, became reliable support centres of Hindu nationalism precisely because their economic interests and their conservative social orientation coincided with that of the BJP.


&gt; In short, the interventionist state—albeit guided by the right motives—has, therefore, always been a part of the BJP’s political personality. It is the belief that decision making must not be doctrinaire and should be guided entirely by practical and nation-building considerations that sets the BJP apart from both the Congress and the Left.",caj8q9,,false,/r/india/comments/caj8q9/p_a_summary_of_what_drives_right_wing_politics_in/,Politics

it might sound crazy/scary/unlikely and even preposterous considering how the modern state has enough resources to crush you so bad that you arnt even recognizable but consider the facts. the bureaucrats and the defense personal who the state calls for help during a protest or riot is unhappy as far as i know people who are serving or who are in the academy hate whats happening to the institution they are going to be or are already part of due to cutting of many promised privileges and perks.
talking about the general public, we are literally scammed everywhere from the water we drink to air we breath to even the religion we worship, unlike developed countries where breaking of pollution laws will result in heavy fine and cancelling of license in india you can pay and your clean on paper. institutions are pretty hollow no work happens until you are a part of the system or have enough money to throw around. large number of MPs are criminals or have a history or are out on bail or are aids to criminals and help them escape,  We have politicians who are mostly incorrigible rogues and rascals who have no genuine love for India, but have looted the country, taking much of the country's wealth to secret foreign banks and havens, and who know how to manipulate caste and communal vote banks, often by inciting caste or religious riots. 
Our bureaucracy has largely become corrupt, and so has the judiciary. law and order is corrupt and ineffective.pollution being everywhere is real not only in your water  but also in the food we eat the regulations are not imposed strictly and nor action taken, clearly if action was taken in any way i wouldnt see maggie in stores and wouldnt feel like im smoking 100 cigarettes even when i dont smoke shit. 
on top of that water in your river is shit literally companies dont even have the courtesy of cleaning their discharge and the govt sends all the shit straight into the river.
talking about the future will of the nation our education system and healthcare is pure SHIT. High cut offs in govt colleges to kids dead in hospital, i dont think i need to talk about it. 1 out of 3 malnourished kid is a Indian apparently im not saying this UN is. we produce millions of graduates and only half a million gets employed rest are expected to sell pakoras. women and girls get raped for reasons such a caste, honor, dowry and just for being born a femalepeople in general have stopped giving two fucks, they park where they wish making roads into personal garages, building regulations are not enforced and Delhi is literally a war zone right out of jarhead with dust and smoke literally everywhere.

i remember reading about a speech by the protector of commonwealth Oliver Cromwell who in 1600 marched into the parliament with soldiers and said  ""It is high time for me to put an end to your sitting in this place, which you have dishonoured by your contempt of all virtue, and defiled by your practice of every vice; ye are a factious crew, and enemies to all good government; ye are a pack of mercenary wretches, and would like Esau sell your country for a mess of pottage, and like Judas betray your God for a few pieces of money. Is there a single virtue now remaining amongst you? Is there one vice you do not possess? Ye have no more religion than my horse; gold is your God; which of you have not barter'd your conscience for bribes? Is there a man amongst you that has the least care for the good of the Commonwealth? Ye sordid prostitutes have you not defil'd this sacred place, and turn'd the Lord's temple into a den of thieves, by your immoral principles and wicked practices? Ye are grown intolerably odious to the whole nation; you were deputed here by the people to get grievances redress'd, are yourselves gone! So! Take away that shining bauble there, and lock up the doors.You have sat too long for any good you have been doing lately... Depart, I say; and let us have done with you. In the name of God, go!""  then closed the parliament.A drastic and total change in the system is now required. Tinkering here and there with amendments will not do. The Constitution and the system itself has exhausted itself. The whole system in India, including our state institutions, is like a building which is totally dilapidated thanks to us and the people ruling us. Renovation and repairs will achieve nothing. It calls for demolition and fresh construction. We have to create a new, just social order in which everyone, not just a handful, get a decent life a society of virtue.",c7pj9u,,false,/r/india/comments/c7pj9u/do_we_need_a_indian_version_of_french_revolution/,Politics

1562306047,PMYOUMYTITS,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c9cd5u/ysk_that_the_indiabangladesh_border_is_dubbed_the/,42,43,,,"YSK that the India-Bangladesh border is dubbed the ""Wall of Death"" by Bangladeshi locals. The BSF admit responsibility for the death of at least 364 Bangladeshis and 164 Indians.","The BSF used to shoot lethally at civilians trying to illegally cross the border officially until 2011. In 2011, the shooting of a 15 year old girl [Felani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_shooting_of_Felani_Khatun), led to an uproar in Dhaka finally resulting in then Home Minister Chidambaram announcing the discontinuation of usage of lethal weapons and the shooting of civilians. 

&gt;Nurul Islam made it over successfully. Moments later, as Felani reached the top of the 2.5m high fence, Indian border guards who had spotted them came running out and shot her dead from close range.  
&gt;  
&gt;“\[The BSF shot\] without any warning. I don’t understand why they didn’t shout anything,” remembers Nurul Islam, who has been relocated with the rest of his family to the Bangladeshi village of Ramkhana, near where his daughter died. “I wish they’d said ‘stop.’ If they’d just said ‘stop’ she would’ve been saved.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Felani’s lifeless body hung from the fence for five hours, in full view of Bangladeshi and Indian farmers living nearby. Eventually, the BSF slung her hands and feet onto a bamboo pole and took her away.  
&gt;  
&gt;It was over 30 hours before her body was handed over to Bangladeshi authorities and returned to her father. “They took her jewelry,” Nurul Islam said, sardonically.

According to Human Rights Groups this did not end the killings though. 

&gt;Except now they come about in more creative ways. Shootings are rarer, but Bangladeshi border guards report recent incidents of fatal beatings, strangling, stoning, and poisonous injections.  
&gt;  
&gt;Human rights group Odhikar accuses the BSF of killing over 1,000 Bangladeshis in the past decade. The BSF themselves admit responsibility for the deaths of 364 Bangladeshis and 164 Indians since 2006.

[This article](https://www.pri.org/stories/2012-01-04/bangladesh-india-border-wall-death), from which the above two sections are, was published in 2012. 

The Narendra Modi government proposed to Bangladesh [single high border fences with anti-cut, anti-climb properties](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/india-to-propose-to-bangladesh-single-high-fences-with-anti-cut-anti-climb-properties/articleshow/64941395.cms?from=mdr) in 2018. In that article, the BSF claims that killings went down to 0 in 2018.

&gt;Following repeated complaints by the neighbouring country, India adopted a policy that the BSF would use only non-lethal weapons along the India-Bangladesh border. As a result, since the beginning of 2018, there have been no deaths on account of BSF firing at the border till date. In 2017 the number of deaths was 14, less than 18 in 2016 and 26 in the previous year.   
  
&gt;  
&gt;“This looks like a win-win situation for both the forces – BSF and BGB (Border Guards Bangladesh). From 26 deaths in 2015 and BGB (Border Guards Bangladesh). From 26 deaths in 2015, we have come down to zero till date in 2018. It used to be an issue of grave concern for Bangladesh,” said the BSF official. 

However, Human rights group Odhikar report [11 killings](http://odhikar.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Statistics_Border_2000-2018.pdf) along with 24 injured and 16 abducted in 2018.",c9cd5u,,false,/r/india/comments/c9cd5u/ysk_that_the_indiabangladesh_border_is_dubbed_the/,Politics

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR, but still longish but bite sized transcription below. (See from around 10:00 to hear it straight from source).

&amp;#x200B;

* Congress party has not done no building of talent for the past 15 years.
* Congress’ victory of 2004 was a fluke that mislead them to hubris and stopped any reform in the congress party and prevented them from building any talent since.
* All the young people RG brought in have either wasted away or joined other parties.
   * E.g., Mahua Mitra - ‘Congress ke Sipahi’ got disillusioned with Congress and joined TMC.
* In contrast to Ms. Mitra, who actually fought elections, almost everyone in decision making role in CP draw their power from merely being around RG. Most are not electable, and many have not even bothered to stand for elections.
* Practically, RG cannot leave because CP has no one to leave the party to now. Historically every regional congress satrap has left to start his/her own party (Mamta, Pawar, YSR etc), and RG is barely electable, forget leading an opposition.
* How messed up is Congress?
   * The Congress Working Committee has 54 members.
   * 19 of these contested Lok Sabha elections. 16 of them lost.

1. Only 2 permanent members - RG(Wayand) and SG(Rae Bareli) won.
2. 2 special invitees not permanent members (Gaurav Gogoi and A. Chelakumar) won.

* Some of the other members of the committee:

1. Deepak Babariya - close to RG, responsible for MP. Never contested elections
2. Avinash Pandey - General Sec of the party, incharge of RJ, only contested in 1985 in assembly.
3. Ahmed Patel - Last contested in 1989 as MLA.
4. AK Anthony - last contested 2001 as MLA
5. Gulam Nabhi Azad - last contested 1984 for LS, 2006 Kashmir MLA.
6. Moti Lal Vohra - 1998
7. G. Sanjeeva Reddy - 1967 MLA!!!!",c82fsj,,false,/r/india/comments/c82fsj/on_what_is_wrong_with_congress/,Politics

Here is a link to the members of the CWC, https://www.inc.in/en/congress-working-committee

Now, if you did click on the link above and see the members in the CWC, you'll definitely be wondering that, all of these people have stuck here for so long, even though many of them don't have much of a political or electoral projection. Many of them are basically dinosaurs, antiques of political figurines. They in my opinion are the ""YES Men"" of the Gandhi family, it isn't much of a secret that many of them believed that the 2019 election would go in their favour, that the agenda set by them would work, they even lead Rahul Gandhi to believe it, I suppose when everyone around you would say that this works and you'll win, you seem to start believing it at some point. Not only were these members of the CWC living in a bubble,after Rahul Gandhi announcing his resignation, all of them disagreed, and it's not even because they care, the simple reason behind a Gandhi at helm for them is ""Self-preservation"".
Look at the alternatives they provide aswell, they would rather choose someone within the CWC to lead them, rather than being someone from the outside in. 

If an outsider would arrive and take reigns of the Congress leadership, it would be his imperative for him to forcefully fire or retire these member of the CWC, since they play a far more important part in the misfortunes of the Congress in the recent elections. They have collectively failed to bring up state units of their party, many of their more prominent members of state units were poached or just straight up left the party. Also this has lead to keeping the top leadership ie. the party president in a bubble that everything is fine. This obviously doesn't leave Rahul Gandhi Scot free who should be guilty of surrounding himself with people who would only agree with him always and make it seem that everything would work out. 

The risk now proposed by many is that in the case that Rahul Gandhi would resign there could be a possibility of factions of Congress getting split up like it did after the 1996 elections, they think that like Sonia Gandhi became a unifier of these Congress factions later on when she became the party president, Rahul Gandhi would be doing the same thing, however unlike the last time, almost all of the Congress state leadership has been exported from the Central Congress (the one in Delhi, the people who are close to the Gandhi's, such as Kamal Nath, Scindia or Pilot), with the exception of the Punjab Congress which works with a certain autonomy, every other state unit is weak. Also a risk of splitting up now, actually wouldn't exist because now they don't have any factions strong enough to win elections on their own. 

The solution to this is simple the CWC members need to be removed or retired out, the present CWC members are much rather a closed group of individuals, who's main priority is self preservation of power for them and theirs after them and keeping the top leadership positions away from outsiders, they are quite literally (though it's a very losely used word) the Lutyens gang. Unless they have are from in the CWC, a resigning Rahul Gandhi will just be replaced by one of them and nothing will effectively change. Sure we might see them winning elections, but that still won't be becuase of them being an effective electoral force but would be because of the failure of the  government in keeping it's promises. To change its fortunes the Congress needs to have a long haul of reforms, mainly in it's CWC to ensure that it can overcome the tag of party of dynasts and of the privileged few.

 First they win over the population by winning over the majority then declare the minority is conspiring day and night to finish 'us' I.e. the majority,  



be extremely vocal against foreign influence no matter good or bad when they are not in power. e.g.  FDI bill of UPA time allowing for 75% of FDI in retail . BJP going crazy over secular govts attack on their baniya brothers. This is an actual quote by gadkari . Sushma swaraj announcing she'll shave her head out side parliament if such draconian laws are passed.



Then when they come to power they passed 100% FDI bill shamelessly within months  .




There are numerous examples like this like the India US nuclear deal etc. If you look closely it becomes so clear that BJP has tried to weaken Indias standing in the world setting as a self relient powerhouse and but on other hand  increasing the market value of Indias, their end game seems like to make a consumption giant in today's global economy , a mere  market for foreign players to sell their good in , kind of like a watered down version of British raj 




But Indians,  myself included were made to think opposite,  Thanks to BJPs marketing game . They made us believe that BJP is taking all the right actions , bringing India back to her glory days . Now I realised the newly found respect from Goras and chinis is because we are making our markets easier for then . Indians hate that ,All this was impossible if BJP didn't have their Propoganda power . 


In Points the step they are taking :


1&gt; made party funding totally opaque,  now they can receive huge funding from anywhere ,no question asked 

2&gt; control large no of media outlets , made all of their voter base to watch it religiously.  Think for a moment,  can a self respecting,  successful , unbiased person watch channels like zee , India TV?

3&gt; after winning majority vote they merged their organization with the idea of nation . Now you cannot criticize BJP without being accused of anti nationalism. 
BJP = Bharat 



4&gt; slowly taking away human aspect of enemy group from their target audiences conscience.

But what they don't get is this hatred will shift toward their own after, if always does, after they're done with muslims most probably baniya, jains, gujjars  or other well off communities will be the target. 



5&gt;eliminated competition,  a viable option for people to turn to when they realise it's time for a new govt .

6&gt; Shifting of point of comparison,  I Remember people used to be unhappy during Manmohan days that India is performing not so good w.r.t China, singapore and USA in key sectors . Nowadays people are happy that we're out performing Pakistan in almost all sectors.



7&gt;instilled  fear of extinction in target audiences  ,constant violence,  riots and rape involving communal angle to keep the narrative us vs them rather than have people focus on real issues concerning the nation. 




&gt; this is not a point for the argument but another observation,  Hindutva imo was never possible to grow into this level of degeneracy if it wasn't for radical Muslim leaders having a free hand for so long. And no small percent of every community argument is not valid here. 



Last generation of middle class and rich muslims is directly responsible for this , they never spoke against I'll commented by their members,  I doubt know how but even the most emphatic muslims I know can just turn their head the other way if the culprit involved is Muslim and victim is not. 



Who is most vocal about hindutva ? Other Hindus


Who stoped separatist movement when they turned violent in Punjab? Sikhs



Who was most vocal against church abuse ?  Christians .



Unless we acknowledge this fact BJP will keep riding on the us vs them sentiment no matter how much we abuse Modi or Shah.

My best friend and classmate didn’t get placed. Neither did he secure admission into a government college for post graduation. He has a very low percentage and poor communication skills. His family wants him to come back to his village and continue work in their half acre paddy field. None of us knew about his economic situation until he recently told us. He was always disappointed on hearing about holidays and stuff. We used to wonder why ? It seems at his house he could eat only one proper meal cooked with broken rice. He studied entirely on state funded scholarships till date. But unfortunately can’t study further probably. Looking at his state I wondered why he had to face such a situation. Another friend of mine who is from the city unlike us actually is the son of a police officer who took gate coaching and utilising his reservation for getting into IIT. While this guy has to quit studying because his family has no money to feed them.
TLDR: It occurred to me that often privileged part of the backward classes that have already benefited from reservation are repeatedly exploiting it hurting the chances of their own community that’s still economically and socially depressed.

Ranting on twitter/reddit/facebook doesn't seem to do anything. In my opinion, violent protests on streets is not an option. For some reason, voting is not being used as a weapon against this.

Surely, there is a need for a revolution. With BJP in majority in Lok Sabha and to be majority in Rajya Sabha, congress in disarray, opposition is virtually non-existent. Media doesn't do shit.

Some have called it a “sealed-cover” jurisprudence, and in many cases such as the Rafale case, the CBI  director case etc, Supreme Court benches led by Gogoi  asked for all critical information from the government to be submitted under seal.  This means that decisions on these cases cannot be subject to public scrutiny. The SC was asked to determine the constitutional value of the electoralbonds instituted by the current government, which is has stalled.

Though the NJAC was shot down by the supreme court some years ago to retain judiciary independence, the collegium system is also vulnerable to influence by the executive. In fact, for the very act of ruling against the NJAC, the executive delayed the process of appointing judges etc by not moving files.

She is quite close to us and lives with us( I have a joint family) when she comes to our state. 
Her home is 30 mins away from my college. It takes around ₹230 one sided in Uber Auto, so rounding off ₹450 in a day just to travel. But I'll have no food expenses, no laundary issues or whatsoever. Their house is really big and I'll be very comfortable undoubtedly. She is so close to me that she might even arrange a driver for me to pick and drop. But I don't think I should give her that much trouble. 

So what do I do? ₹450 in a day is just so out of my budget. 
Should I reduce my travel expenses by traveling in trains/buses (please tell me about this in detail in the comments) 
OR
Should I look for a shared room, like a PG or a shared apartment, online or meet a few brokers? 

Please help.
Edit: 
I live in Powai. Near Hiranandani Gardens. The nearest bus stop is Hiranandani Gardens bus stop. 
My college's name is TSEC. Nearest bus stop is National College bus stop. 
Now, my budget is 1200-1500 per month in terms of travel. 
I am okay with A.C buses as long as they are convenient and not overcrowded. I downloaded the m-indicator app but it doesn't show the fares of the buses. 
The thing with locals is:
1) they are heavily crowded (please excuse me, I am new to Mumbai)

Here is the news from today:

&gt; [Sanjay Sinh resigns from Congress, Rajya Sabha, to join BJP](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sanjay-singh-resigns-from-congress-rajya-sabha-to-join-bjp/articleshow/70448603.cms)

&gt; His term was set to end in April, 2020. 

&gt; Sinh's wife Ameeta Sinh, who is the chairperson of the All India Professional Congress in UP, has also quit the Congress.

His political history:

&gt; Singh had lent support to Sanjay Gandhi when that member of the Nehru-Gandhi family had chosen to contest the Amethi constituency in the elections of 1980. 


&gt; However, Singh left the Gandhi-led Indian National Congress (INC) party in 1988 and joined Janata Dal, which was led by a relative of his first wife. 

&gt; He later changed his allegiance to that of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and in the 1998 Lok Sabha elections he won the Amethi constituency seat.

&gt;  Although Singh stood again as the BJP candidate in the elections of 1999, on that occasion he was faced with a challenge from the widow of Rajiv Gandhi, Sonia, who played heavily on her family's contributions to the area. Singh lost.[6][8]

&gt; He rejoined the INC in 2003, choosing to announce his move on the birth anniversary of Rajiv Gandhi.

&gt; He gained a second term as a member of the lower house of the Parliament of India in the elections of 2009. Since that time, he has represented the Sultanpur constituency as a member of the INC.

&gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjay_Singh#Political_career


Sidenote:

His personal life is a bit filmy too. He is married the widow of an Indian badminton champion Syed Modi, who was murdered under suspicious circumstances. Sanjay Sinh was chargesheet by the CBI but the case was later dropped. The aftermath is crazy as well:


&gt; Shortly after being released for lack of evidence, Modi's widow, Ameeta, married her long-time lover, Sanjay Singh. This marriage received sensational reportage in the press and became front-page news in India. Sanjay Singh's wife, Garima Singh, read of the wedding in the newspapers and filed a case in court stating that she had never been divorced from her husband and praying that the court declare his second marriage invalid (due to bigamy) and order restitution of her conjugal rights. Investigation revealed that Sanjay Singh had obtained a decree of divorce by stating a wrong address as his wife's residence. He had given the address of one of his several houses for that purpose, although Garima had not lived in that house for many years.

Psychologist Lynn and Nyborg promote for cutting all immigration from 3rd World countries.","So the psychologists here are stating that immigration from 3rd world countries like India should be cut off to save ""white"" civilization. As black or brown people have low IQ and they are going to ruin their ""white"" high IQ countries.

[https://brainstats.com/average-iq-by-country.html](https://brainstats.com/average-iq-by-country.html)

We know that these scientists have some very questionable results considering that India's HDI, GDP per capita have improved. 

Many people were (either by BJP or Congress) and are still getting lifted from poverty. We know that the country is better than it was in 1990s.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy\_of\_India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_India)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_countries\_by\_Human\_Development\_Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Human_Development_Index)

&amp;#x200B;

Yet people like Richard Lynn and Becker show that IQ got lowered for some reason. Becker also posted his study on research gate here-

[https://www.researchgate.net/project/Worlds-IQ](https://www.researchgate.net/project/Worlds-IQ)

You can download his stuff. 

Richard Lynn is known for espousing scientific racism to ""preserve"" or ""save"" the ""white"" civilization. He sympathized with white nationalists and supremacists. Many white nationalists and academic white nationalists like Nyborg, Rindermann have promoted such racism against all countries(which include black and brown population) except far east asian countries like China, Japan and South Korea.

Not just that, they also lowered Indonesia's IQ from 87 to 78. Ghana's IQ lowered from 73 to 58 holy shit.

REMEMBER BELOW IQ 70 IS CONSIDERED INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY. A person below IQ 70 cannot pass even 5th or 6th grade. IQ below 80 is considered elementary school dropout. That is, a person with below IQ 80 will not be able to drive vehicles. 

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence\_quotient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_quotient)

According to Lynn's and Beckers research, an average Indian is nearly intellectually disabled. What the fuck?

AND DUE TO THIS, these academic racists are promoting stuff like cutting off immigration from all Brown or African countries.  This is messed up stuff. They are promoting ""white"" nationalism and that is why I put the flair of politics here.

These race ""realists"" are dog whistling actual nazi tactics of sterilization of black or brown people, promoting discrimination against low IQ people by promoting statistics where they show correlation between genetics, IQ and crime. 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically these psychologists are trying to promote that black and brown people have ""bad"" or ""poor"" genes.",ccrlnc,,false,/r/india/comments/ccrlnc/book_promoting_scientificacademic_racism_cites/,Politics

I get to see a variety of cases for administering radiation and chemotherapy. 

I frequently come across patients with sulphuric acid burns on their skin applied by a local quack who claims to ""cure"" their cancer 

Now effects of that are two fold.  One the skin will have burnt and got infected 

Two that patient cant be given radiation since the skin is fucked 

The nmc bill which recently cleared the lok sabha legalises such quackery by letting anybody take a 6month course in medicine and prescribe allopathic drugs 

I dont care if you're not a medico but I'm disappointed by the lack of outrage and media coverage in general

Imagine for a second that you or your family member needs emergency  medical attention and the government mandates an untrained quack to deliver that care 

The nmc bill also completely dissolves the mci. Agreed that there are serious corruption issues with the mci.

 But dissolving it and making the licensing council a political body with meagre doctor representation is a grave error. It is just a continuing trend of the government trying to control anything and everything and destroying the autonomy of independent bodies 

The bill also lets private medical colleges fix fees for 50% of their seats.  Meaning they can sell mbbs and md seats. So you know who's going to be setting up pvt medical colleges in the future 

If you're a medico you must be already pissed by now 

If you're an aspiring medico not too late to think about other professions 

If you are a medical student strongly recommended you give mle and do pg in the states. 

If you are not a medico then pls voice your opinion and protest because this effects everyone and I don't want to be the one to say ""I told you so "" 

Edit - AIIMS delhi resident doctors association has called an indefinite strike including emergency services from tomorrow

They form nearly 50% of the workforce (much of which is superfluous) and have an outsized impact on elections. 

Consequently, government after government is forced to take decisions to placate them. Be it massive subsidies and farm loan waivers to water policies that actively harm the rest of the population and future generations.

Take water as an example. We've had a record dry spell and it's clear that in the next decade, we'll have some very, very serious water shortages.

All the propaganda in the media focuses on individual responsibility. That if you *just* used a bucket instead of a shower, and if you *just* stopped washing your car, maybe we will solve India's water crisis.

This sort of shaming is nice - and we should all strive to save water at an individual level - but it completely neglects the root cause of the water crisis: farmers. Or rather, unsustainable farming practices.

Agriculture accounts for an overwhelming 80+% of all water usage in India ([1](https://www.orfonline.org/expert-speak/if-80-water-consumption-in-india-is-for-agriculture-why-is-it-unregulated-and-inefficient/)). The rest is used by industry while domestic use forms a tiny fraction of the pie.

However, water usage efficiency in Indian agriculture is a paltry 38%. [Source](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/only-38-water-use-efficiency-in-agriculture/articleshow/67562239.cms)

Moreover, Indian farmers continue to grow water intensive cash crops like sugarcane in water scarce areas. The largest producer of sugarcane in India is UP. But UP also struggles with water scarcity. 

Yet, no one would dare tell these UP farmers to stop growing a crop that takes 3-4 times more water than a regular crop. Because telling farmers anything means that the government will lose the next elections.

As long as India's farmers continue to play an outsized role in Indian elections, we will continue exacerbating our water crisis - among many other issues.

They are, for the lack of a better word, holding this country's future generations hostage.",ch7g0h,,false,/r/india/comments/ch7g0h/cmv_india_is_being_held_hostage_by_its_farmers/,Politics

1. Chief Information Commissioner is currently at a Chief Election Commissioner level.
2. They have an immutable term of 5 years.
3. The salaries are not paid by the government. Instead paid by the same body that pays Supreme court Judges and CEC.

What this amendment want to do :
1. Remove the level/status of this CIC to currently unclear level/status(It's Modi govt,why are we not surprised on the unclarity)
2. Remove the immutability from the term of CIC to an unclear number.(jibe at BJP with text in brackets , same as above)
3. Control the only source of income of this independent CIC.

I don't know if this is not the desperate attempt by the government to try and hide whatever they want to hide then what is.

Thought that sectarianism was a pillar of the Saud Iranian rivalry? Think again, think Kashmir where the two countries’ geopolitical rivalry and Turkish ambitions cross sectarian lines.



With Iran, Saudi Arabia and Turkey competing for Indian Kashmiri hearts and minds, Iran and Turkey’s embrace of Kashmiri nationalism is winning them sympathy among both Shiite and Sunni Muslims.



The two countries’ perception of Kashmiri aspirations as nationalist rather than religious gives them a fighting chance to counter long-standing Saudi influence in the troubled South Asian region.



The Kashmiri competition, like Kazakhstan where a Saudi-inspired apolitical and loyalist strand of ultra-conservative Islam has gained popularity, suggests that crown prince Mohammed bin Salman has not given up on religion as a soft power too despite who seeking to root his legitimacy in newly found Saudi nationalism rather than the kingdom’s ultra-conservative interpretation of Islam.



Prince Mohammed, since coming to office in 2015, has significantly cut back on funding and converted the kingdom’s major funding vehicle, the World Muslim League, into a group that sings his praises and propagates tolerance and inter-faith dialogue.



Nevertheless, the crown prince  views the promotion of Madkhalism, a particular Saudi strand of ultra-conservatism that preaches absolute obedience to the ruler and sees the kingdom as the model of Islamic governance as a way of countering Iranian activism and the notion of an Islamic republic that recognizes a degree of popular sovereignty.



Saudi Arabia invested an estimated US$100 billion in funding of religious seminaries, cultural and higher educational institutions, media organizations and in a handful of countries militant groups as part of a more than 40-year religiously cloaked, globally waged covert war with Iran.



More recently, Turkey has sought to lay claim to leadership of the Muslim world by funding mosques and other institutions across the globe and seizing up Islamic causes like Jerusalem.



The funding, coupled with diplomatic pressure, also aims to counter the far-flung, embattled empire of Fethullah Gulen, an Islamic preacher who lives in exile in Pennsylvania and whom Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan accuses of having staged a 2016 failed military coup.



Iran, Saudi Arabia and Turkey’s identification of Kashmir as a battleground points to the increased importance they attribute to South and by extension Central Asia.



In a twist of irony, Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan appears to be embracing the Sufi Menzil sect, one of the largest and most powerful Sufi orders in Turkey, that is far more liberal than Saudi Arabia’s ultra-conservatism but shares with Madkhalism a rejection of politics.



Menzil Sufis have filled vacancies in the government bureaucracy and security services created by Mr. Erdogan’s mass purge in the wake of the failed coup of alleged followers of Mr. Gulen, according to journalist Timur Soykan, who recently published a book on a more controversial Sufi order.



Like Madkhalis, Menzils, with a history of support for the Turkish state and its military, potentially could serve as anti-dotes to Iranian Shiites’ activism in places like Kashmir where Iran is targeting the Shiite minority who account for 15 percent of the region’s population.



Iran and Turkey’s emphasis on nationalism rather than religion compensates to some degree for Saudi Arabia’s first starter advantage, allowing Iran in particular to make significant inroads in Kashmir.



Portraits of Iran’s late spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, loom large on billboards in Shiite neighbourhoods whose streets are named after Shiite martyrs. Saudi Arabia’s execution in 2016 of a prominent Shiite cleric sparked anti-Saudi protests in Kashmir.



Unlike Iran, Turkey, eager to expand economic cooperation with India, has restricted its focus in Kashmir to verbal support in international fora rather than the funding of mosques and/or schools. That has not stopped separatist groups from embracing Mr. Erdogan even if that doesn’t challenge Saudi influence on the ground.



Indian journalist Asit Jolly estimated as far back as 2011 that 15 percent of Kashmir’s population was  affiliated with some 700 Saudi-inspired ultra-conservative mosques. A Sufi organization put the figure ten times higher.



Ahl-e-Hadith, South Asia’s oldest Saudi-backed religious group, is believed to have funded some 150 schools, colleges, orphanages, clinics and medical diagnostic centres in Kashmir.



“Practically every village along the picturesque, poplar-lined, 60-km stretch northwest of Srinagar towards Gulmarg has one or more Ahl-e-Hadith-funded mosques. The new mosques and their attendant madrassas make for a contrasting picture with the hundreds of dilapidated mosques built over centuries in the age-old Sufi tradition,” Mr Jolly reported.



""The Wahhabi influence is not new to Kashmir as followers of this Islamic practice have been there since the last 100 years. But the phenomenal growth in their influence and their far and wide reach now can be attributed only to the funding the local 'Ahle Hadith' have got from Saudi Arabia in the last 30 years,"" said an Indian intelligence official more recently.



Added analyst Abhinav Pandya: “Kashmir is becoming the ground zero for a new geopolitical race for influence: Iran and Turkey have deep, sometimes overlapping interests, Saudi Arabia wants to ensure a return on its financial and ideological investment… The question is whether these states…will weaponize those supporters in a future proxy conflict between themselves, or between separatists and India itself.”

I quickly reported this to the nearest police officers I could find, but they said they couldn't do anything as I didn't get the entire number.

There is a lot of market research and understanding of finance and economics involved, all of which I do like and feel can pickup, I have a background in it as well.

Taking him to hospital tomorrow. Need advice.,"Have always been interested in helping people, specially poors. Few days back saw a thread here in which many were wishing they could do something to help the needy. Here's an opportunity.

Have always given money to people whom I have felt are genuinely needy. Similarly, found an frail old guy, walking with a stick, dirty clothes etc today. SO asked if we should help, I said sure. SO went an offered him 20rs to eat something (we usually offer biscuit packets, but no shops were around). The old man took it, said 'thank you'. SO asked what will he eat, he said he can't, as he vomits anything he eats. 
Then he went ahead, and started showing his foot. Swollen and shiny. He told he hurt it while sweeping a temple nearby. Broken glass piece was the cause he said, because slippers were not allowed. We asked when? He said 6 months ago, and this is 7th month. He said he can only consume cold drink, anything he eats is thrown out.
SO said let's take him to hospital. A private one was nearby, but we didn't have any vehicle, so we have told him we will come tomorrow. Have noted down his location (sleeps outside an apartment with his wife).

My queries: I feel the infection might be bad, so better to take him to govt hospital. Can anyone guide me regarding this? As the wound is 6months old, could amputation be required? 

Will try to meet him tomorrow and upload pics.

tl;dr: Found an old guy who sleeps besides road with an infected feet (6months old wound), want to take him to hospital. Pvt or govt? How not to get cheated at hospital? Will they reject the patient?

UPDATE: Called 108 (thanks to u/doctor_d9) last night to enquire about the facilities and whether they will help a homeless man. Operator on the call was quite helpful, assured us that ambulance will be sent and everything will be free of cost. 
As per the suggestions of u/Sharmajikabeta2 , we decided to go and convince homeless guy to go in the ambulance along with his wife. But as expected, he wasn't ready. Started saying things like 'what if they amputate, what will I do without my leg, when my time will come I will go (die) otherwise God will help' etc etc. Tried explaining to him, all attempts were futile.
He told he is himself going to hospital today with his wife, just to take medicines (free in govt hospital he told). 
In the end, gave him 200rs (might help him in something), and have told him that will come to meet him again in few days.

I was telling him how I see so many people in their 40s in my office living paycheck to paycheck with no real retirement plans and one sickness away from bankruptcy.

He is 26 and was taken aback. He had somehow assumed that he would be rich by his 40s. How, he had no clue. But that's the dream he has been sold ever since he was a kid that he's believed it.

This is something I see so much around me. Young people who don't really have the education, skills, ambition, ruthlessness and heck, even luck to be really financially successful (I stress ""financially"" - you can be successful in other areas of life)

Yet they all somehow believe this marketing fiction that they will have CXO titles, big houses and fancy cars.

So they make decisions based on this belief. They buy expensive phones on 12 month EMIs. They blow their entire annual savings on a single 7 day international vacation.

Why? Because everyone on their Instagram feed is doing it (never mind that their parents only vacation to Shimla).

If you are one of these people - and by default, average people are most people - I really encourage you to take stock of your lives.

Ask yourself:

Do you really have the drive, skills, network, education and most importantly, the ambition to push for senior management/executive level? Most people never become VPs and CXOs because they simply don't want it enough. And that's okay. Just know if you have it in you or not.

If not, you have to ask yourself: are you doing the things you are doing - taking vacations, buying gadgets - because you *really* want to? Or are you doing it because that's what everyone around you is doing?

Instagram envy is a very real thing. You have to constantly watch out that you don't fall victim to it. Don't model your life on somebody's highlights. And don't take decisions assuming the best case scenario.

Lastly, figure out early what you want from life. And more importantly, figure out what you're willing to give up on.

So many young people I see have been sold this GQesque idea of a male figure who can do everything - have a great career, have the perfect body, have a great relationship, exciting hobbies, and social life.

But that's never going to happen. Unless you're a superhuman, you can only have 2-3 of the following: career, health, social life, love life, family, hobbies. Pick what's important to you and prioritize that. 

Because man, I have to tell you, most average people are in for a rude shock in their 60s if they let Instagram dictate their lives",cfp6lm,,false,/r/india/comments/cfp6lm/pragmatic_advice_to_average_people_of_randia_from/,Non-Political

So I've been studying in Bangalore, and have been looking around to buy a scooter for myself, for daily commute. The cheapest option for me, and one which I kind of had a liking towards, was the Honda Navi. Since I need it only for the next 3 years, I was looking at second hand options.

All the listings I had seen earlier were already sold.

Yesterday I came across a listing for a Navi on OLX, mentioning single ownership etc. I contacted the seller, and discussed about the scooter a bit, and spoke about the price, and told him that I will get in touch with him and test the scooter when I'm back in Bangalore in a couple of days.

I quickly ran the numberplate on the RTO Parivahan website just to check all things, and it came back to a different name from the seller. But this name was familiar.

This name, I had seen earlier while running some registration numbers of the earlier listings I had seen. So I quickly went through the listing I had seen on Quikr, and it had the same Registration, and same physical numberplate.
But, the seat cover was changed, and the headlight caps were changed to orange.

The Quikr listing was posted 8 days ago, while the OLX listing was posted 7 days ago.
Quikr listing said 10,700km while OLX said 10,900km.

I asked the seller once again if it was single owned, and he confirmed.

I need some advice as to what this could be. This is the first time I'm dealing with purchasing any sort of vehicle on my own, so I just want to be sure.

If you want to take a look at the listings, I will send them to you via PM.",ca0wrm,,false,/r/india/comments/ca0wrm/planning_to_buy_a_second_hand_scooter_on_olx_when/,Non-Political

In areas like Bandra it goes up to ₹ 20.0 million. You can get a better apartment/condo for similar prices in Manhattan. It’s absolutely insane. People over there make much more money. 

I did some math. If you fund your purchase through a home loan (1,5 crore ₹) after making 10% down payment, with a 9% interest and some principal (20 year loan) you will have to pay at least 20 lakh in the first year. That’s too much for people just starting their career. 

On top of everything the prices haven’t increased since demonetisation. That just shows prices are fuelled by cash transactions which reeks of corruption. The government should at least start looking at this.

Eg : Banta Soda or Goli Soda bottles,"Recently I went into a tunnel of thought about how different our daily use products changed over last two to three decades. Today most of us cry over use of plastic bags, environment change or such but actually we going deeper into being more environmental unfriendly than before. 

For example : As a kid, I used to go with my grand parents with a lunch box or a can to get break fast or lunch from a local hotel. A decade later, my dad used to bring food in newspaper packets placed on banana leaves wrapped by a thread and cans for liquids. Then it was plastic packets and now it is plastic boxes.

Similarly beverages. We used to drink aerated fluids in those lovely glass goli soda bottles but now the plastic mini or big bottles. 

What other daily life objects went more environmentally unfriendly?

Ps : I feel so nostalgic thinking of those goli soda bottles and how awesome and simple they are.

It seems fully-automatic needs a constant water supply.  As opposed to semi in which I used to attach a hose from any running tap nearby. 

Now being an Indian household, the municipal water supply isn't constant and so we have an overhead backup water tank. There are 2 separate taps for each of these water supplies. And there lies my confusion. Which of these taps should I connect the washing machine to? 

Like I said, in my semi-automatic, I didn't have to worry about this, as I would usually try my best to do the washing when the municipal supply is in full pressure (thankfully it has a schedule). But even if it runs out I just plug the hose to the water tank tap. 

We try not to use up a lot of the water tank supply for washing as it's limited and washing generally needs a lot of water. 

So, how should I do about connecting the water supply to the fully automatic machine?

Is there a mechanism that'll easily allow me to switch between the two water supplies while being permanently connected to the washing machine? Or do I have to rely on only one of the two?",cadhmb,,false,/r/india/comments/cadhmb/buying_a_fully_automatic_washing_machine_for_the/,Non-Political

OP in the thread flatly refused to go to a government hospital because he hadn't ""heard good things about them""

Then there were other people in the thread saying that you have to go to Apollo and Fortis and other fancy hospitals only if you have any medical issues.

I just want everyone to know some ground realities of government hospitals, especially in major cities:

1. The medical talent in top government hospitals is almost always the best in the city. The sheet variety of medical cases you get, plus the prestige of working in a top government hospital tends to attract really smart doctors. These doctors can usually leverage their position at a top hospital into a thriving private medical practice

2. Even the residents at government hospitals tend to be better since admission to a top hospital is extremely competitive. 

Government hospitals typically don't have good facilities and infrastructure. You also have to run around a lot to get things done. Which is why people prefer to go to private hospitals, especially if they have insurance.

But please know that the doctor's working at a top government hospital in a big city are all extremely qualified, and plenty of them also have an altruistic mentality.

 My FIL and uncle are both doctors are two major government hospitals and say this from experience. When literally the CM of the state needed some treatment, he came to my FIL, not some private hospital. When Jayalalitha was sick, my uncle was called in from his government hospital.

If you're in a major city and don't have money, go to your city's biggest government hospital. You won't be comfortable, but you will get good treatment",c9pwvc,,false,/r/india/comments/c9pwvc/psa_government_hospitals_are_a_perfectly_viable/,Non-Political

We went up to the doctor at 8 am.

He came by 8:35 . He checked and he said everything's under control - and increased her dosage of anitbiotics.

Not satisfied with his volatile judgements - after that we went up to 2 more renowned doctors in Howrah, Kolkata and both of them stipulated that she can recover within the next 4 days, though her low BP is something serious - but with adequate salts, it will come to normal levels.

&amp;#x200B;

I am happy, All 3 doctors have stipulated that she is safe though she has to drink a lot of water and eat food . Her drastic weight loss according to the doctors was not because of typhoid but because of her low intake of food.

Psychologically, my sister feels a lot more better though physically she is weak- a condition the doctor said will sustain for the next 4 days or so because of high power antibiotics.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to take this post to specifically thank a few people (I am sorry I couldn't personally message you) so I am updating your name here :

&amp;#x200B;

To u/pts_ , u/nihar88 , u/Froogler , u/abhishek123456789011 , u/hidinginyourtrunk , u/Gear5th , u/horny_not_rapey , u/suyashgulati , u/The_Gandhi, u/antarctic0\- You people have been angels in disguise. The support I have received from you is incomparable . The fact and the gesture that you showed with offering money when we are complete Internet Strangers showcases how good is still left in the world. From the bottom of my heart, thank you for your support, which I believe to both of your joys, I won't need :)

&amp;#x200B;

To u/princessa_k17 \- Thank you for your kind words. They were endearing and were really helpful.

To u/lo8 \- Thank you for trying to offer me a subtle way to earn money. I can still help you if you want :)

&amp;#x200B;

To u/GeneralSkyKiller , u/mrfreeze2000 , u/EggShellEmotions , u/Direct_Equivalent , u/banchod85 \- I completely understand if you consider it to be fishy. It's the internet - I never expected anyone to believe me let alone be ready to loan money. I came here partly to vent and partly to get some further suggestions and I completely agree if you think me to be a cheat. If you believe I am trying to garner sympathy (u/Direct\_Equivalent) I am not - I was telling something true- but I completely understand if you think I am trying to feed on human emotions - I am not that guy if you would have met me in real life. To u/banchod85 \- I had already mentioned in the Kolkata thread that I and my sister live here in a cheap PG for studies and articleship - My parents originally stay in Siliguri - My mother had come up 15 days before here - Hence, we didn't know about the government hospitals very well.

I messaged the mods that I am ready to provide any documentation to prove that this is true - still haven't received a word from them - though now it's not required, all is fine :)

&amp;#x200B;

To u/UndeniableDork , u/Kirmaada , u/f03nix , u/iheartsubmariner , u/chromakeydream  , u/bhairavp , u/nxp2ytw3q , u/faltupanti , u/gameboy716, u/Catholic_Joe, u/Darshan_Prajapati , u/iitian, u/Rakesh1995 , u/twistedrea1ms , u/heteretes , u/username-_\--  Thank you for your invaluable information and help - It was supportive in it's own sense and would help me a lot if situations became worse which by God's grace didn't :) Also to u/nxp2ytw3q \- I wans't on an Anti-Modi attitude - my father's business did get a real bad hit due to demonetization - I wouldn't want to bring politics in my sister's health please :) To u/heteretes \- Yes, my outlook on government hospitals has completely changed on account of what I have heard from you all but here's hoping I or my family or anyone else for that matter faces a hospital- going situation :)  


To u/ManifestDestiny1 \- We didn't know - We took him on his word , I don't want to disclose the doctor's name here because I don't think that would be correct - Should I PM you the doctor's name ?  


All in all, Reddit has been wonderful ! The multitude of both support and criticism has been overwhelming. Thank you to everyone whether you called me fishy or you supported me - but you showed interest in my case - which counts. I thank you from the bottom of my hearts and wish to God that all of you have a great and a disease-free life ahead.

P.S : I hand-typed all the names , If there was an error, please tell me the same , I will correct it. Apologies in advance for that :)",c9qmgv,,false,/r/india/comments/c9qmgv/update_on_my_sisters_health_typhoid_shes_safe/,Non-Political

All of us know the above fact but people continue taking intimate videos and photos for sending to their  lover. If you take a pic or video in a compromising situation, once it has been written in the memory of a device, there's no telling where it would end up.

I have seen enough videos where the guy promises that it's for his own personal use or that he would delete it soon after. But they end up in the web, nonetheless.

So we all should take care not to ever click a compromising picture or to film a private video no matter how much you love/trust the other person. Even if the guy/girl is trustworthy, it can still leak due to involvement with his/ her friends, repairmen, co-workers or by himself/herself if he/she ever wants to get back at you for leaving him/her. 

And for guys, just don't do it because imagine what would happen if the girl in question was your sister.",c9wl0l,,false,/r/india/comments/c9wl0l/minor_rant_about_leaked_pics_and_videos/,Non-Political

(Plus a bonus freaky incident),"I've seen some people stick up old passports to their new ones. And i was wondering if i should do the same. What do you guys do?

Actually i have a freaky story. Apparently the print quality of my passport is bad according to some senior official at the Berlin airport recently. I legit almost got held back there because they could not read the last page of the passport which they run through that machine. They tried many times and it wasn't recognising. The guy called his higher officer, they stopped me for 15 min and started questioning me saying, the ""passport is wrong"". He finally let me board and advised me to get a renewed passport. (Had a similar issue in Ukraine, but they ended up making some calls and let me go without interrogating me).

So I'm gonna get it renewed now. But i am not sure if i should keep the old one, because it has this issue. But i also do want to keep it because i already have some visas on it, and i hope that will help me get new visas more easily.

Any advice?",c9ywmg,,false,/r/india/comments/c9ywmg/what_to_do_with_my_old_passport_plus_a_bonus/,Non-Political

After launching four successful book giveaways — [first](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9z3lxo/hello_i_am_giving_away_free_copies_of_1984_by/), [second](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a22a3v/hello_i_am_giving_away_free_copies_of_animal_farm/), [third] (https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a7vzda/hello_i_am_giving_away_free_copies_of_both_the/), [fourth] (https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/az1i04/hello_i_am_giving_away_free_copies_of_crime_and/) — and getting tremendous responses by everyone, I decided to do this more often. Although I am planning to make this a monthly thing, it'd require some time to set it up. I'll've to arrange proper system and channels to ease the process, and have more transparency and automation. I am already on it! ��

**UPDATE #1** Congratulations everyone! The book is now one of the top in Amazon's 'Best Sellers' and 'Most Wished For' Lists ��

For this giveaway, I selected the book which was much requested since our first Giveaway:

**Brave New World by Aldous Huxley**

On BNW: 1984, Brave New World, and Fahrenheit 451 are widely celebrated as the trilogy of authoritarian warning. They are also the most banned books. When you put it in historical context and realize that Huxley's magnum opus was published in 1932 - when Fascism was on the rise in Europe and just before World War II started -  before many of the ideas that Huxley explores were even developed as they are today, it makes it even more of an astounding read. It's a bit disturbing how accurate a book written in the 1930's has been. Also, I think it can be paired with Mill's Utilitarianism to get a good idea.

It takes place in an advanced future where humans are cloned, socially indoctrinated and pharmaceutically anesthetized to passively uphold an authoritarian order. It is a remarkable piece of literature in that it deals with a world that is genetically engineered and could become a reality. 
What makes this novel so powerful; it’s not unbelievable. There’s just enough truth within Brave New World for it to be real. It’s a cruel mirroring of our own existence, should we follow a certain path too strongly. 
Nationalism, Jingoism, Xenophobia, Fascism, Authoritarianism, Totalitarianism, Separatism, Isolationism...how subtly they are intertwined, with much accountability.

Quotes from the book:
&gt; “Because our world is not the same as Othello’s world. You can’t make flivvers without steel and you can’t make tragedies without social instability. The world’s stable now. People are happy; they get what they want, and they never want what they can’t get. They’re well off; they’re safe; they’re never ill; they’re not afraid of death; they’re blissfully ignorant of passion and old age; they’re plagued with no mothers or fathers; they’ve got no wives, or children, or lovers to feel strongly about; they’re so conditioned that they practically can’t help behaving as they ought to behave. And if anything should go wrong, there’s soma. Actual happiness always looks pretty squalid in comparison with the over-compensations for misery. And, of course, stability isn’t nearly so spectacular as instability. And being contented has none of the glamour of a good fight against misfortune, none of the picturesqueness of a struggle with temptation, or a fatal overthrow by passion or doubt. Happiness is never grand.” 

&gt; “But I don't want comfort. I want God, I want poetry, I want real danger, I want freedom, I want goodness. I want sin.” 

&gt; “I ate civilization. It poisoned me; I was defiled. And then,"" he added in a lower tone, ""I ate my own wickedness.”

1562738503,fiinomedia,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cbcvl6/how_corporate_social_responsibility_can_sensitise/,0,8,,,"How Corporate social responsibility can sensitise the locals on Water, Sanitation and Hygiene practices ?","Water, health and sanitation has been a major concern in India for quite a long time. According to a report published in the Huffington Post, 3 infants die every 2 minutes in India due to lack of access to water and sanitation. In India, almost 26% of rural people live below the poverty line. Poor sanitation affects the health and overall development of the country. Women are the most affected by lack of proper sanitation. For example, in India, a large number of girls drop out because of the lack of separate toilets in the school for girls. Only 22% of them manage to complete class 10. 

Various initiatives have been undertaken by the govt to achieve the goal of improving India’s sanitation and curb the problem associated with it. However, the goals require combined action and efforts from government, corporates and non-government organisations. 

Despite making massive sanitation drives across the country, 50% of India still defecate in the open. The initiatives and cleanliness drive though seemed ambitious, there is an urgent need to involve Corporate Sector to promote WaSH components and sensitise people about WaSH practices. Corporates can implement WaSH component through **CSR Initiatives in India.** Corporates through their innovative ideas can plan **CSR projects** and implement WaSh Components among the poor and aware masses of the country. Corporates can reach to the interior parts of the country and benefit the people through their innovative approach. 

In this regard, **Fiinovation Company** has partnered with People’s forum for a social intervention on Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WaSH) components in Paradip, Odisha. The **CSR Project** intent to benefit around 700 households in the district by sensitising the locals on Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WaSH) practises. The program will ensure access to safe drinking water by installing community Reverse Osmosis (RO) plants in the locality. The activities will include the installation of storage tanks for the collection and storage of the purified water. Every household will be enabled to collect 20 litres of safe drinking water each day through this initiative.**Fiinovation Team** investigated the prior condition of the area and concluded that the local people faced immense problem in fetching safe drinking water due to the scarcity of resources. Through the project, Fiinovation pvt. ltd intends to improve the quality of healthcare with access to clean water which is important to maintain good health. In addition, it also aims to create community-level awareness session on the prevention of waterborne disease and combating malnutrition by conducting frequent awareness drives and health camps. 

In order to identify the key problem within the community, **Fiinovation Team** conducted a rigorous need assessment study which resulted in some important observations and essential requirements. Insufficient and unsafe drinking water was a major concern in the area. Due to the presence of many industries in the area, air and water pollution was a major issue in the region, resulting in respiratory and skin diseases. Non-availability of primary healthcare services added to the woes of the people. People’s forum realised the need to sensitize and create awareness amongst people and implement various initiatives listed in the project activities. As a part of the project, other activities like tree plantation in and around the colonies, school campus, playground and other suitable places, aimed to reduce the flow of pollutants has been initiated. Also, the existing Self Help groups have been employed to carry out the execution along with the NGO. 

India can truly achieve the target and surge towards becoming a developed nation. All we need is a collective effort between all stakeholders, adequate funding and determination to achieve the goal.",cbcvl6,,false,/r/india/comments/cbcvl6/how_corporate_social_responsibility_can_sensitise/,Non-Political

Sony is not responding or willing to take responsibility.,"Long story short, a recent security patch update for Android TV (Sony) put my TV into a bootloop. After trying to reset the TV using the information given on their website and failing, I called their customer care. The service guy came, tinkered around a bit, and said that the motherboard is gone and has to be replaced. I am not a novice and have done my fair share of rooting android based devices to know that the bootloop cant be a motherboard issue. Either ways, he asked me to pay up Rs 9k+change for the motherboard repair, to which i refused.

I contacted their customer service, and was told by their extremely uninformed representative that if the service guy said i had to pay 9k, then I had to pay 9k. They cant help me.

I took to twitter but to no avail. I wrote them a long winded email but haven't seen a reply. I cant seem to find a listing of their After Sales nodal-and-above representatives anywhere, and the whole thing just feels rotten. The customer care is absolute pits.

Having never raised a consumer forum complaint or knowing how to go about it, I would like to request ya'll to help a brother out and let me know how to approach this issue. Thanks in advance!",cbi1wx,,false,/r/india/comments/cbi1wx/a_software_update_broke_my_sony_bravia_led_tv/,Non-Political

I'm a 28 year old dude that read the usual Archies, Tinkle, Asterix etc as a kid but always wanted to get into more mature series and didn't know where to start since there was so much out there. As I became an adult and gained a serious interest in music and films, I became quite curious about manga, seinen manga in particular. As a huge fan of Asian films, especially those in the samurai genre from directors like Kurosawa and Kobaiyashi, I started collecting samurai manga like Lone Wolf and Cub, Vagabond, Blade of the Immortal etc. Within two years of collecting, my tastes in manga became even more defined just like my tastes in music and films and the pic below features my entire collection as of today. I've slowly started getting into western comics/graphic novels too although manga holds a special place in my heart. Curious to see the collections of other Indians.

I'm just a guy without too much of morals. I have lied when the need be for personal gain at times.

So, I met my (future) wife via a matrimonial website. However, my mother wasn't comfortable telling this to everyone. So, she instead told some people that I met her through a friend in a function. Now she expected me to say the same thing to whoever asks. (This would also require me to cook up further stories in case people question deeper.)

People give a lot of damns about others' lives in our society. Because most of the people one generation elder are free from productive work.

I thought, she must have her own reasons. If she says that I found her through matrimony, then they'll ask her why she didn't consider the option they were proposing to me and all that. So, I thought that, she may have her own reasons, and she's willing to marry me and very supportive. Now let me just do what she says and not give her more problems for once.

When I asked my (soon to be) wife about this, she plainly refused to lie to anyone. Also, she said that we should be strong, otherwise, we'll be trapped about worrying about society and life will be difficult.

Then I told her she doesn't need to lie and I'll see whatever I have to say. After that, she stopped talking with me.

Now, due to her not talking to me, I felt bad, and I talked to my father and he'll convince my mother. I won't say to anything, or tell the truth, but I won't lie. 

Let's assume that I know that they'll know anyways. But it was about agreeing to my mother's request instead of arguing with her like I always do.

Now I feel bad, that I lack the morals and strength of character I should have been having.

Edit: An added info seems necessary. I didn't hide it from my friends or close people. Only from the people that my mother deals with but I'm rarely going to see. She could have her own reasons and rather than questioning her, it's about agreeing to her one request or just ignoring it. Maybe her reasons are wrong. So do I go ahead and try to change her or do I agree to her is what this is about.",cfu2kn,,false,/r/india/comments/cfu2kn/am_i_the_asshole_for_being_ready_to_lie_about_my/,Non-Political

Edit:

I was thinking more along the lines of adding a bot to the subreddit which would translate from one language to another within the 22 languages. For eg, if someone types in Gujarati, I could reply to that comment with something like !tohindi which would invoke the bot to translate the Gujarati to hindi and reply to my comment with the translation.

Devanagari or any other script is usually difficult to type with unless you use something like Google Translate so most of the posts would still be in English but for the people from rural areas who are comfortable with and only use Devanagari keyboards on their phones (for eg: my grandmother) a bot like this could be very useful.

I also understand the irony in having an english command for translating to other languages but it is a syntax, though I believe commands for Reddit bots could be added in other languages as long as it is in the Unicode.",cf3n8o,,false,/r/india/comments/cf3n8o/why_do_submissions_have_to_be_in_english/,Non-Political

Mumbai's response is flabbergasted whenever these rains try to shut down you people. 
I was stuck there in 2017's flood, I was in Andheri East, I had to evac my hotel room as the ground floor started to fill with water and I was on the first floor. 

*HERE IT STARTS*


Idk how to swim and I had to cross a wide road where water was flowing like a river and I could see an abandoned bus half submerged in water just 40meters away from me I had lost all hope but then suddenly a few local boys came joined hand in hands made sure everyone crosses the road safely. A group of other boys was already at the other end of the road guiding us where to go next. They weren't any government employee but just some local boys who were making sure everyone gets out safely and I can tell you by the way they looked and dressed, they were from slums and might have lost their home or suffered heavy loss but they were making sure we got out safely and they did stay there for every single soul that day..
As I walked towards Worli (my friend's place), IDK the exact places which come in between. We were walking in knee deep water. On my way, I could see people from apartments were on the road who could have been sitting in their balconies having chai and pakoda and posting on Instagram and Twitter, but they were standing on roads distributing water/ tea and some were even distributing biscuits. I found this kind of stalls after almost every 200 meters. I didn't drink water or ate at any of those single stalls that night, I guess my heart was already filled with the warmth of your hospitality and that smile kept me going.. I walked a bit further and there was a Railways station (just to give you an idea about the location) and there was a big Mosque a few steps ahead and I guess it was a Muslim locality because I could see a lot of Muslims standing on roads making sure everyone is getting out safely, Mosque's doors were open wide enough and everyone was being welcomed with big smile but I kept walking as I had to see how much this city could surprise me.. I saw a few more Mosques on my way and the view was almost same everywhere and I could tell that the code word to enter those mosques wasn't ""Pehle bolo Allah-hu-Akbar"" that day (Yes, this was necessary &amp; I am brahmin as well before you start typing Mull.. in comments). After walking for another 30 minutes I reached an intersection where almost every car was stopping by and asking people if they needed lift, Some people were being a dick obviously by not stopping but there was another group of local boys who were making sure every car was stopped and they could help every senior citizen get to wherever they wanted safely..  I forgot to mention Train and Bus services were put on halt that day.. I finally found a local taxi and when the cab stopped at the sea link toll and I handed him over the money, He smiled at me and said don't worry, not taking it today, go ahead, stay safe. 
I walked 10-12kms that day, I checked that later on map that day, My friend wasn't there he was stuck between Mumbai and Nasik as well so I had to sit at a bus stop for another 5 hours in rain, My cellphone was dead, my friend was coming via Train which was put on hold, he was more than a 100km away we just had this conversation that I will be sitting at that specific bus stop, I had no idea if he will be able to make it, I had no money, my luggage was in my hotel room, I knew no one else in this unknown city  but trust me I was just smiling and thinking about what I saw on my way.. I will always remember this incident and this will be one of the incidents I am gonna tell my kids &amp; grandkids if I ever made it that far..
 
BUT

Now let's talk a bit about being a dick. Every year it's been Raining and you guys are STILL SURPRISED about it. Why? I saw a report last night from Ravish Kumar's Primetime (Please watch that video on YouTube I BEG YOU), and I hope you know about your city's own star Afroz shah who has been pleading every day to save mother nature. I can bet most of you know about the Niti ayog report which predicted there will be no groundwater in 21 cities by 2020 and no water for 40% of India by 2030. If you guys can just start by installing water harvesting system, you guys can save your city from being flooded and can solve Maharashtra from the water crisis. It's no big deal your BMC has one of the biggest budgets and I  don't want to hurt your feelings but  I am really sorry to say you can also put the Shivaji's statue on hold for a couple of years if budget is an issue. 15 countries have declared Climate emergency, we are being kept away from this issue and kept busy in stupid religious issues. 
It's already TOO LATE FOR US, If I am being a dick here then please Google ""GRETA THUNBERG"" and we really should learn a bit from her and millions of other kids who stand with her now. Before I tell you from where I am I need to tell you it doesn't matter (but it'll be fun to know), we need to solve this issue by staying united. If you think you are safe today because water can't reach you today then STOP UNDERESTIMATING THE NATURE.

Edit: I told her about the fact that homeopathy works on dilution. She said; ""keep your knowledge to yourself."" (1714 hours)

I was going to type out a huge post regarding my faults and my problems but fuck that,that’s a long list and not for you guys to handle 

Here’s the thing I started my engineering in the year 2016,I’m supposed to be in my fourth year this coming semester but I doubt I’ll clear my second year.
I fucked up. Huge.
From day one of college to this day.I messed up every step of the way. I had my set of problems too but I run away instead of facing them. I was depressed through most of my time in college,I was socially super anxious,I had a hard time putting my head to study. Well like I told you,it’s a huge list and I’m not here to talk about that. 
The thing is I’m not clearing to my next year and I’ve to stay back another year but here’s the thing I want to continue doing this,I know I can do it. I’m so confident once I put my head into doing my work I will do it,I’m not a stupid kid,I like to think I’m fairly smart but I messed up a lot. But this is what I’ve been telling my parents every single time from my first year,for every mistake. I was pretty confident of doing well after the first time I got a year back but yeah I really don’t know what to do now. I’m blessed to have really supportive parents but I’ve already disappointed them enough. They’ve given me the option of joining a Bba/Bcom course so I can go over with a degree and even given me the option to start working or build a startup but the thing is I know all the mistakes I’ve made during the last three years here and I know I will not make the same mistakes again and I really don’t want to regret leaving engineering knowing I could do it but I didn’t do it because I didn’t study enough. 

I was still keen on completing my course but I read a quote saying insanity is doing the same thing again and again expecting different results. So I’m here and any advice would be nice.

I'm a terrible person who couldn't even study or get a degree. A total failure and a disappointment to my parents.

 I remember crying on the first day of college life because I hated it. It's nearly five years. I'm 23 now. By hook or crook I managed to finish only 2 years that too with beyond fifteen backlogs stilll remaining. I've been detained twice already and dropped out once. I am not able to focus because of procrastination and severe other attention issues but my parents don't get it. They just think I'm lazy. 

I just finished 4th semester. I'm sure the results will not let me go into next semester. Another year gone. By the time I finish engineering, eight years will have passed since I joined. I don't care anymore.  I'll be 26 by then just out of a shitty low tier college with no experience. 


I've don't have many friends. Those I have have either graduated or doing something worthwhile.  Most of them earn good or are going for masters in America.

Some friends left me because of my bad attitude. 


My parents are sick of me and my mom compares me with my friends or other children of her friends and it makes me feel so emasculating.

But I can not do anything. I wake up no earlier than 3 pm because I've no energy to get out of my bed, nor I go to sleep before 5 am because I can't bear closing my eyes or putting my phone aside. The voices and the anxiety consume my head.

I've other chronic pain in my body and a few other physical ailments. I have no interest in living.  I don't enjoy doing these bad habits deliberately. 

I think of suicide everyday but I don't have the courage to.",c8vhip,,false,/r/india/comments/c8vhip/my_life_is_completely_destroyed_and_i_see_no_way/,Non-Political

1562562867,for_acedemia,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cagvi4/np_rant_indian_men_are_the_biggest_crabs_in_the/,84,161,,,[NP] [Rant] Indian men are the biggest crabs in the bucket and we need to change that.,"This is in response to a thread I read in here which stated some Italian woman who was concerned with her Indian interest. Comments like 'Beware he'll run away' or 'Indians are either too nice or too disrespectful' always come in when these kind of threads are there. 



Everytime you see an Indian dude who is usually much above the typical 'Hilaake soja' mentality of most guys out there, people shame him to no limit and then bring them to their level. Why can't you be happy for someone else's success? Even when someone's asking for some decent advice, are we that critical of ourselves that we label that person as bad/indecent for asking advice for a basic human need?


Every single time a friend of mine gets someone pretty to date this is the general mentality. 'Isko kaise mil gayi itni achi (How did he find someone so good looking', 'Langoor ke haath me angoor''Bodyguard/Friendzoned hai/Bas ghuma rahi hai' are the typical comments. 
Is it really that hard for you to believe that someone might not be as miserable as you when it comes to the opposite sex?


Other than a handful of folks who are sincere, you get nasty comments from everyone around you if you try to work on your health/looks. It's like being Indian is a curse and that label just means you have to be an ugly looking bloke with a pot belly on your body since that's the way it 'should be'.

No one tries to learn from the other person, no one tries to instill the values that the person might have, they always reach the simple conclusion that if I, who is playing video games and has a dull IT job, I can't get a decent woman then no one else can in my circle. That mindset will get you so far lmfao.


Are we this self hating that we can't believe for a second that an Indian dude is not having it that bad with women or life in general? And we just have to instill the stereotypes that most of the decent dudes out there are trying to fight?





Please support and uplift our brethren, we need it much more than others. A humble request, that's all.",cagvi4,,false,/r/india/comments/cagvi4/np_rant_indian_men_are_the_biggest_crabs_in_the/,Non-Political

1562572248,Pixel2Prime,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cai4wm/substantial_leakage_of_airconditioning_from_metro/,4,26,,,Substantial leakage of airconditioning from metro stations,"I recently noticed that some metro station( specifically janakpuri  west) has a glass door at the entrance that can be closed , however the  door is kept open the entire time leading to a substantial loss of  cooling outside.

I am aware that since the rush  is high this is bound to happen, however the amount of loss of cooling  is very high to ignore.**I was feeling the cool air from a distance of  about 10-15 m from the door! the entire radius of 10 m outside up to the  road has a temperature similar to inside of metro station**(a large crowd  of rickshaw wallas even tend to sit there to cool themselves down),  unlike other metro stations that are located underground which limits  loss of cooling as cool air tend to stay down, Janakpuri west has a very  high loss of cooling which i am sure is leading to higher usage of air  conditioning in that station.

In this age where  we are trying to limit global warming and the detrimental effects of  over usage of electricity and air conditions to the environment it will  make sense to take appropriate measure , such as appointing a guard to  close the door when passengers are low , or a structural change to the  passage so that this issue can be solver earliest.",cai4wm,,false,/r/india/comments/cai4wm/substantial_leakage_of_airconditioning_from_metro/,Non-Political

I was driving my kid to the day care and I need to make a left turn and then another right within 50 feet of turning (so I basically couldn't be over 15 kmph). I take the left (with turn signals on) and turn the right signals on and make a turn - bam a two wheeler on my right trying to over take me bumps pretty hard on the door and makes a huge dent. He then starts to tell me how it was my fault and when I mentioned about the turn signals he starts to back off and says he didn't see it. ""DIDN""T SEE IT? WTF?"" Where the fuck are your eyes when driving?

As I was stopped and speaking to this moron, another moron shows up out of the woodwork from the side of the road and says, ""it happens, move on"". WTF? Anyway, I ask the two wheeler to park on the side so I can get his insurance details, he fucking takes off.

This ,people, is exactly how you enrage people and make them do things they normally wouldn't. If I find you, you're dead meat.

All I am asking is for people on two wheelers to: 1. Use the rear view mirrors (actually use them), 2. Fucking watch for turn signals, 3. Don't squeeze into a gap that is tighter than a rat's ass, 4. calm the fuck down while riding.

This is what their website says :

""The Human Library is designed to build a positive framework for conversations that can challenge stereotypes and prejudices through dialogue. The Human Library is a place where real people are on loan to readers. A place where difficult questions are expected, appreciated and answered. The Human Library is a danish idea from 2000 and is now available in more than 80 countries.""

Some of the topics that were available to read was

*Depression
*Alopecia
*Accident Survivor
*Gender fluidity
*Porn Addiction

They do have a FB page : 'Human Library Bangalore'

Kudos to the Organisers of the Human Library Bangalore chapter for making it happen, I think they are available in few other cities too in India.

IMO, they deserve much more attention and awareness from the people.

Context - I am pretty bored this summer so I decided to follow my oldest passion of making a youtube video. 
I have grown up watching YouTube. Currently 19 yold.
I had tried making few videos 6 years ago, about tech and completely in English but that time the project shut down pretty quick due to my weak ass computer, bully friends, and lack of English Indian audience on Yt &amp; some more challanges. Eventually I even deleted those videos. After that I got pretty busy with studies and tutions. 

Now coming to today I have seen the growth of hindi audience on platform and wish to exploit it. All stars have basically aligned in my favour. I am vella as I waiting for college to start, I just bought a new laptop which can handle editing. 

Now the real issue is 
1. My Hindi is bad!
2. IDK what hindi audiace and rural audiance watches the most on the platform.",c9geq8,,false,/r/india/comments/c9geq8/some_opinions_and_help_required/,Non-Political

Many non Gujarati people may not know about this disaster. Even many young Gujarati (who are in their twenty/thirty) don't know about this disaster. As per wiki,

* Estimates of the number of people killed vary greatly ranging from 1800 to 25000 people
* The Morbi dam failure was listed as the worst dam burst in the Guinness Book of Records (before the death toll of the 1975 Banquiao Dam failure was declassified in 2005).

I born and brought up in town near Morbi and thought to share this because 

* As stated many people don't know about this disaster
* My cousin's Aunty is from Morbi and I remember she told that during this disaster they climbed up to 2nd (or 3rd floor) terrace and water level was just 2-3 feet below from terrace
* I just saw a upcoming Gujarati movie teaser on this disaster (and I liked it as per regional movie standard) And I believe this movie can be good watch for even non Gujarati people https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFrjG_9vgNw

Gorgeous soundtrack (Very Gustavo Santaolalla-ish feels), almost perfect use of color for the scenes that give it a countryside-early-morning-mystique, beautiful performances, great casting and what a story.

You have to be in a packed theater to feel the collective uncomfortable squirming of 200 people when the man emerges from the sewer, the dead quiet of the theater as they collectively feel a sense of entitled guilt.

The fantastic scene where everyone's caste is asked, and the hierarchy explained and the collective laughter of 200 people who are also wondering, damn, I've participated in this shit too at some point.

A massively relatable romantic sub-plot strung on Whatsapp messages that relay the same sense of confusion you get, as you're thrown, deep-end first, into the heartland of the hindi belt.

All in all, the movie leaves you uncomfortable, hopeful and hopeless all at once. And asks you the wonderful question, ""Who the hell are \*these people\*?

An eternal satire?,"'Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro', a movie I vaguely recollect watching as a kid. Even though I couldn't appreciate the gravity of the movie I happened to randomly watch as a kid, I always was for some reason fascinated by it. The corpse of the commissioner played by Satish Shah randomly going AWOL and fucking shit up is all I remember from then. Well, I've heard and read so much about it since then that I made up my mind that I should give it a go now. So, I did. It's available on Amazon Prime Video for those of that are interested, and have subscribed to. No. Not shilling. Merely hoping enough people here can, and do, afford it. Anyhow, having ~~seeing~~ seen the movie now with maturity and cynicism only time can provide, I'm convinced it's actually worth a place in our hall of fame. You can tell from the first frame that it is an old movie, but the things it represents and tries to tackle? Consider me damned if it seems to you that those things haven't aged well and are not as relevant to this age. Humour is fun. Gives us the leeway to actually explore shit without as much of the stigma. Give it a watch. However you can. If you can't afford it, and are a novice to the ways of piracy despite being in India, (make hay folks!) DM and I hope I can help you out. Any and all sorts of discussion are welcome.

My wife had some money in the savings account. Her account manager from IndusInd Bank asked for a meeting to explain a new investment option. The person explained that it was a Tax Free investment for a 15 year period like PPF and would give a return of 9% which is higher than PPF. It seemed all good, they took her signature on a KYC form and cancelled cheque. I asked them about the plan details and they said they will share the next day. In my absence, they asked my wife to get an online verification as per procedure. The numbers weren't discussed at all. 


After 15 days, we received the policy of Tata AIA details, I was a bit surprised since the policy was initiated with no discussion on the numbers. When I saw the policy details, the returns were 4.5%. I immediately connected with the IndusInd guys to explain this and I wanted all the calculations on mail. I got a half baked calculation sheet which clearly was showing 4.5% return. Now the policy had seven years of investment and cancellation had heavy penalty. I told them, it's not acceptable and you need to cancel this without any penalty. But they didn't have the authority to do it and it would also mean accepting their mistake. 


Action taken: I contacted Tata AIA directly mentioning that this was a misrepresentation of facts. Thankfully they were willing to accommodate. In next two weeks I had interactions with Tata and IndusInd, their representative came over personally along with IndusInd. The IndusInd employees were unable to explain the numbers and after 3 weeks Tata AIA approved the cancellation with full refund. IndusInd employees or senior management were not at all responsive or helpful in this case. 


Learnings: Don't make investments through banks, they have preferred vendors and they will oversell to get more commissions. They don't care if you lose or make money. 

This is my second such problem with IndusInd so I will advice everyone to stay away from them if possible. Their policy is to just make more money out of customers. 


TLDR
Don't trust banks in my case IndusInd for third party investments. Specially warn the people around you who don't understand the calculations. Its better to make investments through good brokers whose fees are linked to your returns. That way they also work hard to get more returns.",cep1cu,,false,/r/india/comments/cep1cu/bad_experience_with_indusind_bank_dont_trust_them/,Non-Political

I opted for science after the board exams. Realized I won't even pass, had to fight with family members to change it to Commerce and I passed with 57% marks. 

Came to Mumbai to study CA, Estimated around 2.5 lakhs as fees &amp; Expenses.   Couldn't afford that.  I  had interest in technology so decided to pursue it instead. 

Learned computer engineering (hardware networking) for one year  and got a job at a MNC, worked in that field for 6 years. I was just 17 when Joining this Job &amp; a Didn't complete my Graduation. 

Around 5th year in my job I realized I had more interest in building things on the internet than fixing active directory problems. 


I started learning more and more about it, and build a real blog which got decent visitors and started to make some money.  But to really make something worthwhile I had to dedicate more time.  

I used to live in Virar and traveling to Andheri (Mumbai) every day for job took 9 hrs + 4 hrs of my time and after that hectic peak hour mumbai local the body simply didn't want to work anymore.  

So in around 2013 I left my job and decided to move full time into Internet marketing. 
My wife, her parents and my Mom all thought I have gone mad and pretty stupid. And honestly That's pretty much fucked up if you ask any one of that age. 

For next 12 months I built websites around local businesses in UK , ranked them and sold the leads to two companies. The most successful of them was one was around heavy transport vehicle driving training. The company paid $35 per lead and I made more than $4K per month (around 2L in INR) with it.  

This boosted my confidence and I invested most of those funds into experimenting and investing in digital marketing. 

I used to post my screenshots on Facebook, In 2014 a random dude msged out of nowhere and asked to meet.   He looked confident and we meet at a Google conference later that Week.  

We discussed what we both has been doing. He had lots of contacts at emerging companies and I had the skills, strategies , and contacts to actually delivery successful marketing campaigns.   it was a promising match and we end up forming a company together. 

We built a digital agency, the first client he brought gave us over two crores in revenue. We quickly built a team of about 40 ninjas and went on to become a very successful company. 

In next 3 years We worked with more than a dozen listed companies, 3 fortune 500 company and made a lot of money for ourselves.  

At materialistic levels, just last year he bought a very expensive car (80 lakhs), travelled to over 30 countries and I bought  a expensive home (3BHK powai - 2.5 cr).  

We are still partners and have been doing great so far and hopefully will continue to. 

At multiple times in my career I had to fight with my own people, go against the wind to make my way.  

Point of all this is, you reddit guys are tech adopters and are technically more advanced than the general public.  There is a lot of people who are stuck at a job they hate but can't do shit about it. Either for family pressure or a dozen different reasons. 

For You, I strongly recommend that in your free time develop a skill - mostly in a area you enjoy doing , and use that skill to compliment your primary source of income. 
Once you are confident enough and have some numbers (revenue) to back it up, take a leap of faith and see where it takes.   


Don't worry about failure - If you fail, getting a job is the easiest thing to do.   

I agree that the being a  entrepreneur is volatile and there is no security but so is everything else.  Just see how many people gets fired everymonth with no where to go and they all wonder if they could make something like that. 

Parents ko bus paise chaiye. As long as they see you are making good enough,  they will be fine. Sooner or later.   My father in-law loves to flaunt when I share my photos with a BMW and mom makes dozens of calls telling all relatives whenever she purchase something expensive.  

They just want to see you happy, it's just that their scale of happiness is a bit off.  Trust them to trust you.",cep1qe,,false,/r/india/comments/cep1qe/trust_yourself_and_do_what_you_love_it_works_out/,Non-Political

I hope it will be a good experience, because I can't wait for the second season. I could not find any other sub dedicated to Indian Netflix shows, so I guess if more people are interested, then we can change the sub to include all Netflix India shows, or maybe all Indian streaming services shows like Netflix India, Amazon Prime Video, Alt Balaji, Viu etc. Please show your participation.

1562062762,RejectedCoder,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c87jbg/guide_building_your_resume_while_in_college_as_a/,13,31,,,[Guide] Building your resume while in college as a CS Engineering student [Part 1 / 4],"This is a guide that I wanted to write since a long time and I was inspired by a post written about college placements on this forum. The end goal of this guide would be to land you a job at a product based company. The pre-requisites are that you should not hate coding and you need to know a programming language / at least have the determination to learn.

I will be constructing this guide as a whole for the 4 years that you will be in engineering. Feel free to skip some or add anything extra if you feel the need to. I've been writing drafts for this post since a week and have tried to organize my thoughts, but excuse any disorganization :)

This guide might help you if you check these boxes:

* A computer science student (preferably a newbie)
* Still in college (preferably in 1st year)
* Have a zeal to excel in the field and get relevant jobs.
* Have a blank resume with respect to your engineering degree.

**Stage 0 : Pre-work**

If you are very new to college, the odds are you are either severely depressed because of the achievements of people around you or you are overly enthusiastic for a new beginning or you are just unaffected by college. All of those are okay. If you are in the basket where you are scared of people boasting off about their achievement in the first year of college, don't worry! It doesn't matter what others do as long as you do what you can do and a lot of people who boast do not possess the expertise they think they posses. However, if you feel out of place, do DM me. We can have a chat.

In the pre-work phase, one has to understand their college and how things work in their college. This is best done in first year, before your first summer vacation. Most of the colleges have cells or clubs that have some sort of active projects. You need to talk to people, go through the college website and find out about these clubs. These clubs can be student-run or it can be run by a group of professors. You should be looking at the latter as they have well defined problem statements that they'd be working on and you've better chances of getting good exposure working on these projects.

Make a list of all the clubs that are there. Know about the procedure to get into each of these clubs, the projects they are offering / have previously done and who is the contact point. From these clubs, pick any of the interesting clubs/projects and set a goal to work towards developing skills that would help in those projects.

A personal recommendation would be to avoid highly specific clubs i.e. if a club is focusing on one problem statement that it is trying to solve since a few years it might not be the ideal place for a newbie to join. Smaller problem statements are good.

At the end of this stage, you must have a goal to be a part of one (or multiple) clubs during your first summer break.

**Stage 1 : Year 1**

In the first year, you will be under a common branch and your subjects will be science-related and not field-related. You might have 1 subject each semester that relates to your field, but I am not sure how much of help that would be as the teachers would be teaching the subject to non-CS people too. However, they will be introductory programming classes and its good to focus during these classes. If you don't find them helpful, read on.

We will divide the 12 months of first year into 3 quarters. 

1. Spend the first three months into learning at least one programming language. 
2. In your second three months, you should be able to read code and implement a few things. Then, pickup a programming language like C++ / Java. 
3. In your third quarter, you should look at trying to test your learning by implementing something useful. It can be small, it can be something that's already there, but do try to implement it from scratch by yourself.

Let me elaborate all three stages clearly.  


**Stage 1.1 : First Quarter, First Year - Learning a programming language**  
Python is an easy programming language to start off. You can also start off with C/C++/Java if you really want to skip a few steps, but I would ideally suggest you start off with Python. Learning resources like Hackerrank Language course, Automate The Boring Stuff e-book, some long Youtube tutorials and Learn Python The Hard Way ebook should be of help.  
Note : You should not aim to finish all 4 sources as that is not practically possible in three months. Follow a breadth first learning approach where you read a little and write a little. 

A good step to start off would be to aim to get 4 stars on Hackerrank's Python course to get a good grasp of the syntax. You should be familiar with indentation, for loops, if-else ladders, functions, lists, tuples, dictionaries and optionally, list comprehension. During your course, if you feel like something isn't clearly explained in Hackerrank, navigate to that section of Learn Python The Hard Way and refer it.

At this stage, you are comfortable with reading and writing Python, not explore Automate The Boring Stuff and try implementing some of the tasks given there. (I am looking at something that is onwards from chapter 8 of that book).

Alternatively, you can also watch and implement code from hour long Youtube tutorials that make promise to make you a hero from a zero in Python. But this looks like a hack that isn't rewarding because you are quite literally copy-typing the code that the Youtuber has written.

**Stage 1.2 : Second Quarter, First year - Implement &amp; Learn OOP**

Many companies in the outside market look for Object Oriented Programming as a skill. After writing Python code, you are probably going to curse Java/C++ and will skip it completely because you won't believe how relevant these languages are in the market. This is one of the most common mistakes people do, but at the end they'd have to end up learning at least one of these languages. If you are taking up Java, I'd recommend [Derek Banas' Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE7E8B7F4856C9B19) on youtube. You'd be coding what he's coding, but if you understand your code that is good enough. Learn about data structures in java (List, Set, etc) and learn about Iterators, Object Oriented Design Principles (Inheritance, Interface, Extension, etc). If you are looking for something smaller, [try this Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/java-tutorial/). 

Similar courses exist for C++ also, so do your homework.

**Stage 1.3 : Third Quarter, First Year - Build something small**

So, now you know Python and to some extent Java. You've two paths from here. One is build something using Python/Java or second, learn HTML + CSS + JavaScript and build something with that. It can be something as small as a script receiving some data from an API and putting it in an excel sheet, or a calculator. The idea of this experiment is to check how fast you can build things. Once it is suitably built, you will have to write test cases. If you think it is too early to write test cases, list test cases on an Excel/Google Sheet and start testing your code for boundary cases.

For instance, if you have written a code that takes in a Reddit Thread as an input, gathers all the comments, checks the age of the accounts on all parent comments and returns some analytics (say, how many accounts are &lt; 1 month old, less than 1 year old, etc) on it. You will need to handle test cases where your internet isn't working, the URL is wrong, you can't parse because your authentication token to Reddit API is wrong, the thread URL is wrong, etc. Basically, everything that you can think of.   


**FAQ**

&gt; Should I get an internship in the first year?

Ideally, I wouldn't recommend an internship. Work with personal projects / college projects / skill development. Most of the internships given out to first year students are petty work that would be wasting time. Its much easier to put this in 2nd year when you will have a strong(er) resume.

&gt; Should I specialize in one field?

No. Personally, a lot of students restrict themselves to learning only the buzzword fields, which is wrong. What is a buzzword today might have no relevance tomorrow. Focus on learning to learn, than learning one technology or one area. Initially, learn a little bit of a lot of things and slowly specialize into a field. That way, if your specialization does not click in the market, you always have a strong fundamental to pick something else up.

&gt; Should I do problem solving?

Personally, I would say yes. But it is optional. I feel first year is too early to dive into algorithms and data structures even though a lot of colleges do teach basics of these. If you are really interested, you can definitely spend some time everyday in solving problems on Hackerrank / Leetcode / InterviewBit. But don't overdo it.

Any other question w.r.t first year, please do ask below. I will keep updating the post with interesting questions.

A majority of people here are illiterate or have bare minimum education. The incident happened on subsequent days.

Incident 1-
A current account customer comes to my desk and he wants to check his account balance and I tell him the balance. 
Cust : ""No I received a msg that rs 2.00 lacs has been credited into my account"". 
Me: Ummm no u haven't received the money. From where did u get the msg ? 

*Shows me msg*
Msg from SBIDM says ""Your account XXXX417 has been credited with Rs 2,00,000.00.
I smell scam all around. I ask him did u receive a call from any one asking bank details ?
He confirmed yes. Apparently he got a post cover with a lottery ticket from Flipkart which said he won two lacs and a person contacted him to give his PAN card details bank account number and address. This person gave him all the details.
I warned him that this is just a scam and not to respond to them further and not to give details in future and sent him away.

Incident 2- 

A teenager comes to the bank along with an elder.Says he wants to deposit cash to another bank. I tell him to do NEFT. I notice him holding an post cover that looks important. I casually ask him if its for a college application. He says No I have won a lottery of 12 lacs from Flipkart and I am sending the service tax money .
I ask him the details and he opens the post cover and there is a small cardboard lottery ticket with proper flipkart logo and colourfully designed with a scratch panel where he had scratched and it showed you have won 12 lacs. I ask him how he got this and he said a person from flipkart called him. 
I asked him how the person from flipkart got his mobile number and the boysaid he purchases regularly from flipkart.
After he got the card he contacted the number mentioned in it and  a guy from somewhere north asked him all his bank details stating he was the Bank Manager and asked him to deposit Rs 6000/- ""Tax"" into his account. This account is an individual account and not a corporate account. This seems like just another version of the nigerian prince scame.
Told the boy its just a scam and not to fall for this and to file a police complaint and sent him away after telling him about the way this scam works.

I guess flipkart is selling people's data to scamsters and poor gullible people are targeted based on their locations.

The contracts for construction and maintenance of public roads, buildings, gardens, bridges, street lamps, etc. are awarded behind those closed doors where kickbacks are given and taken in exchange for these contracts. And we all know how the end product is! The work is pathetic and sloppy at best, and simply non existing at worst (which is typically the case).

Unless you are a rare redditor who's municipality is efficiently utilizing their funding, this is the usual scenario for most of India. You may, of course, shrug it off saying its a way of life or ""it simply happens"". But its the tax-payer's money after all, your hard earned money. Don't you feel like doing something about it?

I think we need to push for transparency. A mandatory law which should force all municipalities to make their funding public on a govt. website. Each site should show how much funding they received and how much were spent in contracts, and preferably in which area and cost-center (road/street-lamp/lawn/etc.).

I asked him why are you sending me request instead of sending the money. He asserts once you acknowledge the request by paying 1/- you would receive 2/- in your account. I agreed and I received 2/- in my account. (I assumed may be I don't know how UPI system works). He then sent me back to back 3 requests of 5k each and asked me to acknowledge. I did that( worst mistake). Now the money has been deducted from my account and he has blocked me. Can anyone suggests way to go about this issue ?  
1) Can I contact bank and raise dispute against the transactions ?

2) If I go to cyber police will it help ?

3) Any other strategy that I can use ?

Is the HR justified in asking you to present your salary slips of the last company (also looking into legal angle)? 

I have experienced cases where same work gives different people much unequal pay (probably more because of Alma Mater at this stage, and for some due to pay they were getting at last firm). 

How would you go about the negotiations to extract the maximum? I would love to hear the experienced people out here.

Also, question to any HR's active over here. I had no problem dealing with my manager over salary, but had to face multiple tests from HR. After joining the firm, I realised people at same position, work and experience as mine were earning more than me. How much of your performance metrics is dependent on the negotiations? Also, if an employee is expected to do the same work, how much of a difference should be justified in your opinion?

I decided to go for the online option. 
 I went to the UAN member portal and the message came up to add my PAN . I tried to add my PAN. Oh no. Error thrown as name mismatch. I can't figure it out because my name in all ID cards is the same (yeah I know lucky me).

So after quite a bit of googling I realize that my name in the PAN database is different from that of PAN card (what the actual fuck) and I have to correct it (with 150 rs or whatever) and it will take 15-20 days!!

I think leave it, I just need the money at this moment. So I go to the site and choose to withdraw without submitting pan (tax of 34% deducted for this) and submit a request. Now comes the fun. There is an option. Of form 15G.- optional. Now this form is for nil tax. 

So I don't submit it because I did pay tax. I submit the request. 

After three weeks today I got the message. Claim rejected because no pan card and no 15G. 

The other option is offline withdrawal. And everyone knows how friendly the lovely officers are. 

What a nightmare. It is the time taken that is unbelievable . Anything from 45 days to three months or even more. Sick. 

The fun part is that PF is deducted whether you like it or not. And then it is red tape after red tape and fighting with a broken system to get your own money back!!!!!

If this is the situation for me- someone who is literate and knows how to navigate online, can you even imagine the situation of millions??? Left at the mercy of those PF officers.

So, this is what happened. Company was in a rush to hire, so they hired me in a day. I decided to join for the specific client project which is what I was hired for. Today, I reported to client, and client said ""we don't want this resource"". Reason? ""He didn't listen when we talk and instead spent time fidgeting with legs and not looking into the eyes"". ��‍♂️ As soon as I heard that, I told the parent company, ""sorry, not coming to office ever again"". Client doesn't understand the concept of introversion, and thought I should have spent all the time looking at him. You know, just like how teachers throw chalk at students who they think are not paying attention. 

Btw this smartass was talking about integrity and gave this news to my parent company's HR instead of just asking me straight up during the meeting. Apparently integrity is just for the juniors, while seniors want to be the assholes. 

So, yes, I am leaving the company on day one. �� Day fucking one. �� Only hope is that they don't ask me to serve notice period. I will basically be paying 1 month salary to get out of this shit. �� Thankfully I have other offers in pipeline, so all I lost is one month's salary, and whatever advance from the new place I just booked. ��‍♂️

Anyway, not a rant. Just a funny thing that happened that I thought I should share. Company is ready to release me, because I was fidgeting and moving my legs around while in conversation with the client. ���� Not something that happen on a daily basis.

Edit: Talked to the HR head. He said, since nothing is finalized yet, he is happy to process my release without any notice period or dues. I will not be receiving salary for the two days, but I don't care about that. At least now I can safely join any other organization.",cgcgrw,,false,/r/india/comments/cgcgrw/leaving_job_on_literal_day_one/,Non-Political

Experience have been overwhelmingly negative.

TD had all useful sites unblocked now Airtel blocks many by default. TD provided decent enough download speeds of around 600kbps Peak, 1.2Mbps at night (tested via Fast.com) costing around 99rs for 1.4GBs per day.

On airtel, I am getting 2.5GB per day for use which is impossible to be consumed because of pathetic network coverage. Speeds are infrequent and volatile from 4mbps as network switches from HSPA+ to 2G network within 20 seconds. I suspect this is a feature rather than bug. Tried changing Towers via *#*#4636#*#* absolutely no use.
Additionally getting 5-6 SMS per day of self marketed Airtel services despite of full DND, reported all of those SMS via TRAI app. No response.

Possible alternatives - costly Idea-Vodafone porting in another week. Not a fan of Jio

Sure the Indian society looks down upon you and laughs at you and education isn't encouraged at such ""old age"" by societies standards, but I took the plunge. Here's my backstory - I graduated high school in 2012. Scored a rank of 718 in Wbjee 2013 and took up chemical engineering at Jadavpur University. My father lost his job in 2014 due to mental illness and I had a passion for photography. I started working as a freelancer photographer to meet ends. I couldn't attend classes and by 2015, I had 12 backlogs. I decided to drop out and realised chemical engineering isn't for me. Made some good progress in my photography career. Shot few promotional events with Kareena Kapoor,Ajay Devgan,Govinda,etc. But opportunities became bleaker as I didnt have the money to expand on my equipments and upgrade and hence by 2017 photography was totally a failure. People suggested me to go back and finish my degree. My cousin sponsored my studies and I went back to JU, but I hated chemical engineering. Depression happened and by mid 2018 I had 22 backlogs. I wasnt just simply interested in it. Took the year off to recover from my depression, gave wbjee this year and now I am starting a btech in cse from a tier-3 college. So by the time I graduate I will be 29.
I really love front end web development at the moment. So let's see where the future leads me. A lot of you might ask, why I am going for a bachelor's degree, I could have learnt coding and got a job in six months. Honestly, there are no shortcuts in life. I wouldn't want to be a 35/40/50/60 year old who lost his job and is unemployable now just because he doesn't have a bachelor's degree. 
I have seen a lot of posts here by people who are 24-30 and non graduates and they ask for help. This is for those people, even if society makes u feel like a failure, don't let your mind accept that. Because, u can't change your past, but you can plan and act in the present to build a better future. Dwelling on the past won't change anything. I saw lots of posts from people in their mid 30s to 50s on Facebook job post groups, where they took up a job(without going for a graduation degree) and now at a much older age they are without any job and much options. A smart man learns from his own mistakes, a wise man learns from the mistakes of others. I don't know why our society stigmatises going back to school at an old age, but in USA people graduate even in their 50s. Age is just a number, don't let society come in between your life and your dreams. Failure isn't fatal, Success isn't final. It is the courage to go on that counts. Don't let the past define you. Today is a new day. Start again :)

ElsaGate refers to a wave of videos being produced by different channels, containing pop culture characters (typically Western) that are shown doing bizarre and usually violent / sexual acts. The reasoning for the existence of these varies. For example - some believe, controversially, that it is a form of communication used by child pornographers; others believe that it is to appeal to children for maximum ad revenue. Others believe that it started as a project for maximum revenue, and has now derailed into bizarre competition. *The majority of the live-action videos are made in Russia and the animations in India.* 

I'm concerned about this as pedophilia is not talked about a lot in India. Even though there are several of them present here. Those catcalls you used to get on the streets by wayyy older men when you were younger, yeah, they probably are pedophiles. I've also heard girls getting unsolicited dick pics and inappropriate texts online even if they had their age specified on the platform. Hell, even I have gotten them. This is a HUGE problem and Elsagate is suspected to be controlled by a pedophile ring who create these videos with a motive of reaching a younger, more vulnerable audience in the purpose of grooming them. If these videos are being animated in India as the subreddit claims, then who is responsible for it? I'm sure no one who is normal, who is not deranged, would even contribute to this kind of stuff. I think we should give this topic much more exposure so that this problem comes to light.

To the people who have young children, I would request you to please monitor your child's online activity. It is for their best.

We give unnecessary respect or even hero-worship anyone in a slightly higher position than the rest, or if their skin color is white/pale (saheb mentality), or if they are in politics.

**Stop calling anyone and everyone 'Sir/Madam' and let them earn it**. I stopped this behaviour when I realized, some of the people I interacted with were pathetic people in high management positions.

Not everyone deserves respect because of their age/caste/skin color/position. I understand that our culture has these things ingrained in everything, but don't you guys think it is time to alter that now, in 2019?

EDIT: I distinguish between owed and earned respect. You owe a minimum amount of respect to every living creature not just humans. But let others earn their respect after that instead of giving it yourself.",cihshb,,false,/r/india/comments/cihshb/unnecessary_respectdeference/,Non-Political

So I thought I should post this one here too, since it's interesting, and also because I was asked to by many people from r/India.  I just believe that things like these show our shared history.

Also I know it isn't exactly a British Indian passport since it says Ugandan Protectorate on the cover, but if anyone can tell me if this would be considered one, since my great grandfather was from India and only went to Uganda for WW1.

Train was stuck in an outpost and I went to door to get some air as it was getting sweaty. Suddenly this person (M20s) asks my destination, origin and if family is with me (I'm solo), and why I'm going (to college) then my berth and when I'll arrive (next day at 5am) and stands too close than generally considered normal. I was already getting weird vibes so I go off saying I'm tired. Till now communication is one way partly because I want to indicate what I'm feeling and partly because I don't talk to strangers, particularly in train. Soon after he comes and sits on my berth (side lower) already occupied by two people. It's already cramped and he playfully taps my knee(I was sitting cross legged) and his legs are touching mine more than I like then. Now I'm conspicuously reading college text on my phone and he out of nowhere asks my age. I tell him 19 (it's 18) thinking it will help however little if he plans to mess with me. I continue reading ignoring him and asks if I have GF. I say I don't have any interest which he probably took as I'm not straight or am asexual because he follows up part question that I'll be ""able to do nothing if a naked girl stands in front of me"". I soon clarify that I'm not interested to talk about it which now that I think, he would have taken it the answer to his last question rather than previous question. Whatever he thought he possibly heard my civil fuck off scream and leaves saying he should get lunch. He is likely from next coach and I decided against finding his berth number lest he sees me and decides that I'm interested. I'm bit apprehensive now since I have to spend a night sleeping (now maybe not) while that creep knows exactly where I'm and when my stoppage arrives. I'm thinking about exchanging berth with person above (he will be returning a little favor as he earlier needed my phone to call). I can't call my parents as they can't much do being away and most likely will go into panic mode.

1562871265,kalbhairava,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cbzmbz/nobles_vs_wilds/,6,3,,,Nobles vs Wilds,"MY WORLD VIEW

""Always remember, chaos has a nasty burning desire for absolute anarchy""

There are two types of people in this world / Nature produces two types of people in this world 
TYPE 1 - 
First type are people who are naturally ""good"" , ""gifted"" and are better in everything they do, wether intellectual pursuits or philosophical or martial or spiritual, these guys have merit and are naturally ""gifted"" , they look good, they do good, they think good and they want to do good, lets call them the noble ones (what is that term in sanskrit for ""noble"" again ?)
These NOBLES since are merit chasers, the chasers of the good, the chasers of aesthetics, of marvel, of grandeur, of excellence, their general disposition naturally takes shape such that they always look for ""good"" qualities in something, this is their very first subconscious immediate examination and observation of anything in the outer world for example, looking for a groom ? they will look for good qualities like virtues, intellect, aesthetics in old days the capability of war waging whether physically or through intellect or through leadership, you get the point.
For recruiting for any job they will again look for merits like a candidate's capability for the job, how better a candidate fits for the job etc.
Bottomline is that for these first type of people, their survival principle and intuition or say technique is simple - get better, do better, achieve, excel, hard work, develop your skills, compete, win etc. in other words when facing a defeat in something , they say to themselves - ""well, I must get better in this thing and win next time"".
TYPE 2
Second type of people are people who are not good at anything, they are naturally weak and are naturally inclined towards self destructive habits or in other words ""degeneracy"".

These types of people are more inclined towards ""bad"" characteristics like for example violence, hooliganism, pleasure chasing, alcoholism, quarrelsomeness, driven by their ego and not by a drive of excellence or for something better, lets call them the wild ones.

These type of people always have chaos, confusion, fear, trouble, poverty, violence, quarrels and cacophony among them, the wild ones are very un-predictive, they can be something right now then something else next moment, their mind is wild and not in control so naturally they dont have any kind of goal or purpose in life.

One very peculiar desire these people always have is of total control, the ""wildness"" of these people always sort of ""nag"" them internally to bring others under their submission so that they can then wreck havoc on their subjects by indulging fully into their deep dark fantasies.  

THE INTERACTION 
When these two types collide they first fight each other, naturally the noble ones prevail over the wild ones given the hunger for intellect and excellence in everything of the nobles they come out as the stronger ones.

Once the fight settles and wild ones are controlled by the noble ones, the noble ones following their natural course of progress start building their world which eventually progresses towards more stability where there are no frequent wars, life is systematic, humans have achieved excellent feats in every fields they figured out etc.

To build this world of course the system of noble ones work with the jobs going to the fittest, merit becomes the chased virtue, everyone wants to get better at something, everyone competes with the other in excellence and virtues, this brings out the best in human beings.

Once the graph of world progress becomes stagnant and reaches a saturation point, at that point of time the noble ones recognize that the wild ones are still struggling to settle in world which values merit, virtues, intelligence, and other good capabilities like self control, discipline, good conduct , hard work, etc. as they dont have any, so the nobles now can do one thing - create social hierarchical structure with strict and staunch boundaries with trivial tasks assigned eternally to the wild ones watched under strict laws and protocols, everybody's happy.

One other thing which can be done is to rig or lower the standard of the entire system to accomodate the wild ones effectively, this system facilitates special privileges for the wild ones so that they can adopt themselves better and can catch up with the nobles and with the progressing world.

This system promises free education, extra efforts on the behalf of the nobles for the wild ones, and also special preferences of wild ones over the ones with merit in jobs and other fields of human endeavors. lets call it the SJW system.

This later SJW system makes a fatal mistake, they fail to recognize that these wild ones would never be able to adapt to the system of merit because they naturally dont have any, they are born this way and even they themselves can not do anything about it.

What happens though is that the wild ones actually develop or lets just say ""evolve"" into a better version of themselves by developing a particular skill, its called - MANIPULATION or PLAYING ON THE EMOTIONS OF THE NOBLES.

The wild ones refuse to work, they refuse to even try to learn or to try out good virtues like hard work, focus, self control, discipline, following good laws, following the ones who are wiser and better, humiliation, etc.

The wild ones instead start practicing a very sophisticated and evolved way of doing violence, quarrel and to spread chaos - they start manipulation tactics - they start playing victim, playing blame game, shaming, being passive aggressive, false accusations, emotional blackmail, threatening, spreading false fabrications as facts, drama, illogical and irrational behavior, difficult behavior, pretending to not understand, sabotaging a healthy conversation by irrelevant, illogical or emotionally charged fallacies, uncalled for violent and aggressive behavior, intimidation tactics, theft, crime, falsely accusing system and claim that system forced them to do crime etc.

This is the survival principle and intuition or say technique of these people.

Naturally good people want to preserve themselves, naturally wild people have nothing to preserve or conserve, instead they would like to acquire and subjugate others in an attempt to satisfy their wild ego.

Wild ones makes excuse that they will do good and will attain merit automatically if they get women of the nobles, wild ones make excuse that they didnt do good so far because noble ones never let them, wild ones make excuse that they do crime, aggression, violence, and bad performance in their specially acquired jobs because they are victims of the noble ones, wild ones make excuse that until noble ones totally give up for good and forget their cultural, historical, ancestral and social identity and heritage and sophisticated structure the wild ones could never progress.

Now, you tell me, how wise it is for the noble ones to freely mingle with the wild ones ?

and yeah, there is a secret THIRD TYPE of people, who inject this SJW way into the gullible minds of both the nobles and the wild ones. Why do they do it ? well,  you can see them as the best ones of the wild ones, the cream of the crop in the wild ones, and they want total control, it is in their nature.",cbzmbz,,false,/r/india/comments/cbzmbz/nobles_vs_wilds/,Non-Political

In the last 15 days or so it has not rained continuously for any longer than 10 minutes. The showers that my hometown received are so ""lite"" that you can walk in them without even getting your clothes wet.

There is also another phenomenon that I am noticing. There is a substantial increase in thunderstorm and lightning strike in our region. It has come to a point that in the last two years I have yet to witness a rain without associated lightning strike. Whenever it rains it's like a bad omen. We just cut our power, plug out all our appliances and wait for the storm to pass. This is terrifying. Has anyone of you noticed the same? Has frequency of lightning really increased in the last few years?

I don't have to believe what the internet/tv/scientists have to say on climate change. But when I see the extremely high temperatures of 44-46\*C in summer and no rainfall in the rainy season, I can only ponder is this is what we have come to at last?

My writing/listening skills are excellent, but my biggest problem is I can't think and speak simultaneously (I stutter a lot and forget what to say next, my mind goes blank BTW).

I mostly watch English movies, listen English songs, but still don't get what's the issue. I admit I am an introvert, so that might be a problem.

And also the accent, it sounds terrible, even worse than that of call center guys (no offense) .

I am planning to go abroad for my Masters in near future, I need to seriously improve my accent, something like Indian version of American accent like those NRI's usually have, or maybe less Americanized but fluent like Virat Kohli, SRK, Priyanka Chopra etc.

Can someone list me some,

* Tips/exercises.
* Video courses (e,g Udemy), books or Youtube channels, something that teaches how to speak fluently &amp; how to coach your tongue to get that American accent.
* Also, how to think and talk simultaneously.

The road in front of Ramjas College was dug up by Jal Board many months ago. Since then it was a mess of rocks and dust and the whole area was heavily polluted because of all the dust that blew up because people continued driving on the dirt road. 

On 29th June I tweeted PWD this: https://twitter.com/pratikarora/status/1144834202996637696

They responded with a complaint number which they have since removed (don't know why).

Yesterday while driving in that direction I noticed that the road was barricaded on both sides. Today they confirmed by replying to the original tweet that repair work is underway. https://twitter.com/DelhiPwd/status/1154693436538150912",ci2zwr,,false,/r/india/comments/ci2zwr/i_think_i_got_a_road_fixed_via_twitter/,Non-Political

Now it is used as a unit to measure the value of a person as to how ""sanskari"" he/she is, and if they don't want to touch an elders' feet, they would be frowned upon by others and regarded as spoiled brats *by primarily their own parents*. Don't get me wrong, I do not, in any way, intend to eradicate this tradition, as it is sacred in our country and its importance should be taught to others but following it in order to show one's respect should be left to the person himself and not their parents. Moreover it leaves you guilty and awkward when you accidentally forget to touch an elders' feet and your parents instruct you to do so. Touching feet should be interchangable with a greeting like ""Namaste"" or ""nice to meet you"" and most importantly, should be an option (or atleast should come from within) rather than being a necessary obligation.",cdvkzm,,false,/r/india/comments/cdvkzm/unpopular_opinion_children_shouldnt_be_forced_by/,Non-Political

She makes spelling errors that I simply never expect. I can understand if you misspel a word or two but she literally gave the client company an entirely different name.

1563298230,Minuteman60,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ce06hm/lifecycle_of_indian_male/,62,47,,,Lifecycle of Indian Male,"Day 1 – You are born. Parents are celebrating that you are male and even more happier if you have fair skin.

&amp;#x200B;

Childhood – You are expected to go with the flow. You begin to learn the ins and outs of Indian society. Everything can be bargained for in the market and wild animals are everywhere. Creativity, loners, and independent thinking are frowned upon. If you get bullied, **IT’S YOUR FAULT FOR BEING DIFFERENT**. Anything bad that happens (poor eyesight, too short, too fat, etc.) is also **YOUR FAULT**.

&amp;#x200B;

More Childhood – Your parents educate you on your background/culture and how it is the best in the world. In public, your family act friendly with everyone but in private they may make comments ranging from politically incorrect jokes to straight up racist statements. But it’s okay **BECAUSE YOU’RE SPECIFIC CULTURE IS THE BEST**.

&amp;#x200B;

Teenage – The only thing that matters are grades at this point. Sports? Not for you. Music? Weak hobby. Art? That’s for transgenders. Comparisons begin with sharma ji’s beta. Pretty soon, you realize school is not about learning but regurgitating information in a short amount of time. Many people get good grades but few have any curiosity and even fewer learn good civic sense. Teachers are abusive but it’s **YOUR FAULT** because **ELDERS CAN NEVER BE WRONG**.

&amp;#x200B;

More Teenage – You somehow get into college. Only options are medicine or engineering, otherwise you are out of the family because no one will marry you. You also realize that your parents don’t really love each other and try to emotionally blackmail you because you are the only reason they are together. Girls are to be avoided because they only want sex and are a distraction. Everyone (friends, families, distant relatives, neighbors) is in your business because **NOTHING IS PRIVATE**. You are responsible for family honor.

&amp;#x200B;

Studenthood – You go to college. You meet many indoctrinated kids but join the crowd because who are you. You (or at least me) grew up with few female interactions and fail miserably at getting a girlfriend because you are too shy. By the time you get your act together, you are 22. At least you made some good mates.

&amp;#x200B;

Adulthood – You become an Engineer or Doctor **BECAUSE EVERYONE DOES IT**. You probably get a job. A high paying job. It doesn’t matter how much you work, what you do, or if you enjoy it because only **MONEY MATTERS**. If you don’t get a job, it is your fault because you weren’t competitive in the rat race.

&amp;#x200B;

Now you are expected to marry a women significantly younger than you, from a (very) similar background, is fair, very educated but also a housewife. **TROPHY WIFE**. You will be expected to live with your parents who will control your adult life just like their parents did to them. Your new goal is to get to America/Canada/UK **BECAUSE INDIANS BRING THE BEST CULTURE**. Even if you don’t make it, anyone who you know does is automatically a good friend that lives abroad.

&amp;#x200B;

To put this into perspective, I watch 100+ movies every year and this year I have already watched 104 movies. Anyway, I stopped watching bollywood movies after 2012(Jab Tak Hain Jaan's story gave my brain permanent retardation and incurable cancer). Anyway, a junior was recommending me Kabir Singh since 1st July, and I was reluctant and hesitant to watch this movie. So today I went and watched this movie. 
Here's my review and ratings -
Rating 2/5...
The cinematography and acting was awesome. Shahid Kapoor's acting was 5/5. I don't have any problem with the misogynistic, drug abusive, violent portrayal of Kabir Singh,because it's just a character. The first half of the movie felt like I was watching something new and refreshing from Bollywood. But things started getting downhill as soon Preeti got married. The story went down the drain, like why was he allowed to perform surgeries in intoxicated states? And he gets punished when he didnt want to perform the surgery but he had no other options, then the logic started going out of the window, suddenly this and that happens, suddenly when he plans to move one, Preeti is conveniently single/seperatee and she didn't even let the other guy touch him. And they get married and Happyzzz Endingzzzz!!! Cliched bollywood. Omg!!! For once why cant they write something different and why are most of the Bollywood's storyline pure garbage??? Like who eats up this shit and doesnt get brain cancer?? 
Just came back an hour ago from this pathetic movie, I wish I had stayed home and watched Euphoria season 1 Episode 5 instead. Never going to watch a Bollywood movie unless it gets nominated for Oscars or something.

\- Do paid certifications have any value ( udemy, coursera.etc ), given that we can do the course for free without the certification.

1562659527,stuli1989,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/caxwac/np_best_cutting_rates_by_half_should_definitely/,4,14,,,[NP] BEST cutting rates by half should definitely help traffic in Mumbai,"Just came across this: [Mumbaikars to pay less for Buses](https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbaikars-to-pay-less-for-best-buses-rides-from-tuesday/story-KARIQCHW8pN0SB5vBkeiiN.html) and think it's a master stroke from the authorities.   


Due to multiple factors year on year ridership in the BEST buses has been decreasing. The effect was hastened by the fact that often a shared auto or cab would be just a couple of rupees more expensive than the bus leading to their increase. 

The reduction of usage of buses naturally had a cascading effect through the system and boosted  traffic which slowed down buses and kicked off a less than virtuous cycle.

&amp;#x200B;

With this reduction of fares I hope that bus travel in Mumbai once again becomes viable and a preferred option. Many routes were unviable due to the low number of passengers and while the fare reduction is drastic hopefully the surge of usage will be enough to offset this and make the routes viable. If this scheme does have it's intended impact it will reduce traffic my absorbing a massive number of passengers and speed up travel. Eventually leading to a cycle of more bus routes and even less traffic and more convenience. What we desperately need though is the app like the Bangalore teenager made (sadly the bangalore public transport corp blocked his access, though that's for a different topic) to track buses and ensure that wait times are reduced.  


Will this make you think about using the Buses more in Mumbai? Let's discuss in the comments.",caxwac,,false,/r/india/comments/caxwac/np_best_cutting_rates_by_half_should_definitely/,Non-Political

The bus was being driven at a speed of 120 km/hr. There is supposed to be a speed governor in state run buses. In this one there wasn’t.

The bus driver was driving his first big route. He didn’t know the route well enough and thus, he detoured twice causing delay. He was driving fast to make up for that lost time. Generally, there is supposed to be a team of two drivers for such journeys. Here there wasn’t. Only one driver driving alone. Add to it, he was tired and sleepy. He had been driving all night.

The passengers report telling him to stop and wash his face with water. He did so only 20 minutes before the accident. He continued thereafter and the next time he dozed, they all fell.

It’s not all grim a story. A villager called Nihal witnessed the accident, jumped into the drain, broke open the glass windows and rescued two to three passengers. He was the one to call the police as well as alert fellow villagers to help come rescue. Nihal is a hero.

However, this wasn’t just a freak accident. There were no two vehicles bumping into each other because of a technical snag. There were no animals suddenly crossing the Expressway. There was simply a driver tired and sleepy from driving the whole of the night. One who didn’t quite know the route and one who was speeding to reach in time. And despite specific guidelines particularly designed to avoid such accidents, a non-following of the same leading to the deaths of many.

The government has announced a compensation of Rs. 5 lakhs each to the family of the deceased and Rs. 2.5 lakhs to those injured. An investigation committee has been set up. Officials will be now be involved to figure out what seems to be staring us right in the face.

Road travel is dangerous. It is made more so by overworked sleep deprived drivers who could really use a partner driver or perhaps a nap.

And the thing is I travel a lot by bus and I would like to not think about it much but I do. For the system by design wants me to completely put my life in the hands of another. Accidents can happen but the least one expects is to not die because someone didn't get proper sleep.

Do they think I'm an idiot?","It's the semi-final so we decided to order in. Wife wants veg momos, I want fried chicken. 

So I placed one order on Zomato from one restaurant. Another on Swiggy from another restaurant.

Come the scheduled time for delivery, I get a call from Zomato that my delivery guy met with an accident and because of that, they'll have to cancel the order and place it again, which will take another 30 minutes.

I said fine. I'm not going to complain if some guy is in some accident.

But 5 minutes later, I get a call from Swiggy that my driver met with an accident and thus, they have to cancel and place the order again.

I can understand one delivery guy meeting with an accident, but two guys from two different platforms meeting with accidents within 5 minutes of each other?

Obviously both Zomato and Swiggy over promised their delivery times to win customers. When they couldn't handle the load (it's a game night after all), they're blatantly lying to people.

If I had placed just one order, I wouldn't have caught on. But since I placed two, the lie was blatantly obvious.

I'm not even angry, just disappointed that they would have lying as some sort of company policy",cb2j4f,,false,/r/india/comments/cb2j4f/so_both_zomato_and_swiggy_orders_i_delivered/,Non-Political

This dude has got no chill. Super confrontational and a micro manager. All the colleagues have validated this part. 

I discuss my concerns with him because he had spoken rudely to me in front of everyone a few times. Conducts standup and retrospect that devolve into blamegame every time. We come to an agreement that I work with another team. 

However the two teams are again merged and I couldn't take it anymore and I resigned having found something. Despite this, I feel I could ask to be more diplomatic in future. 

So today there was some issue with the code and I said I spoke to someone who is from same contracting ccompany and part of the team. He began confronting me why in the daily call. I responded that we could speak offline but he was adamant and wanted to know why at that instance. I felt attacked and did raise my voice. 

How to react to such situations where you are not allowed any leeway in responding? Being polite won't work as the other party is not willing to listen. I want to be equipped to handle this.",cb2v44,,false,/r/india/comments/cb2v44/need_advice_on_how_to_deal_with_this_in_workplace/,Non-Political

They're given cases from the court  and the magistrate asks them to give a confidential report about the one found guilty on the basis of which the court gives its judgement

There was case where a Hindu guy married a Muslim girl and eloped. It was a love marriage and they both had their consent on it.

The girl's family reported a kidnapping case against the boy. The girl's statement was taken in the court under Article 164 where the girl's statement is considered the truth(or so my mom told you can google it up) and she said that nobody forced it on her. The boy's family were quite patient and accepted her.

2 months later a few people on 3 bikes came over the boy's place and broke through the house while they were having dinner.

The boy was then beheaded in front of his family
They then took his body in a bag and threw it away in a river 2km away while the head was still in the house.

I will not get into whether reservation is good or not. I just want to clear the confusion amongst people.

Q - Is there reservation in ISRO?
Ans - Yes and No.

There are a lot of Departments and in ISRO and everyone’s contribution matters but we will focus on the post “SC” which stand for Scientist / Engineer recruited with their examination every year because they are the backbone of the organisation.
Recruitment of SC happens from different streams which are-

BE001-Scientist/Engineer 'SC’ [Electronics]
BE002-Scientist/Engineer 'SC’ [Mechanical]
BE003-Scientist/Engineer 'SC’ [Computer Science]
BE004-Scientist/Engineer 'SC’ [Civil]
BE005-Scientist/Engineer 'SC’ [Electrical]
BE006-Scientist/Engineer 'SC’ [Refrigeration &amp; Air Conditioning]

For ISRO first three streams are more crucial, they are recruited in Separate batch and last three streams in another batch.

There is NO RESERVATION for BE001, BE002 and BE003.
Reservation is applied on BE004, BE005 and BE006.

You can check their notifications yourself from official website.

It was an arrange marriage arranged by parents. Girl's parent spotted me via some online service. Like normal human being I met with girls seeks his opinion on wedding and said yes to wedding.

One thing was notable that she was not very much excited to get married to me. But I ignored it by fact that may be she is having cold feet on getting married. Therefore I always tries to help her in keeping things calm.

Till I we got married everything was fine. But problem started immediately.

Immediately after wedding she left to her home town to continue her teaching at local coaching centre. Promise me to comeback in feb.She came back in feb after I put pressure on her parents. We started living together she started living as depressed person. We used to have daily fights and then I used to see her depressed every day every night.

Meanwhile she already said no to sex with me. Told me it will take time. I was okay with it. But still she used to see me suspiciously as if I came to rape her. Try to avoid me at the same time at all the time. Strangely she use to love my relatives. We had put up 5 - 6 parties when she was with me.

In order to help her I thought sending her home is good idea. So i called her parents and sent her home.

Once back home she joined a short term course in near by university. Her parents and she told me that she will join me once course over.

But in the mean time she started avoiding me. Not responding properly on call. Talking woman empowerment on call. Telling me member of male dominant society.

Strange statements like I am not attracted to you. We are not a-like. But she never made any stand against me in front of mine or her parents.  I tried my best to say sorry. Beg in front of her. Telling various things. But all gone waste. She never made any call to me.

Last  week my parents call her parents and her to my house. At that time I realise that she hated me all these times and my affection towards her is one sided. She still did not took any stand upon asking when she is back at my place.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

After 7 months of wedding today. I am hopeless that she will ever come back to me again. I lost almost 20 KG of weight and I used to cry every morning and night. I lost focus at my work. Lost my interest in everything. I am filed with anger for no reason.

I am from middle class and traditional background.

I am afraid of telling this to anyone.

Because of some spiritual background we never took any money or gifts from bride side. Also my mom handed over her stuff to her 2 days after wedding. Bride mom offered us 5 lac in cash but I never accepted anything.

I am stuck in my life now. My wife do not want to come back. I lost my concentration everywhere. I am hopeless and do . not think anything as if now.

When I think of hiring lawyer my friends make me afraid that I have to pay her money.

Please help me.

1564496535,ExtensionChapter,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cjsfwh/im_fed_up_with_the_aviation_industry_in_india/,3,0,,,I’m fed up with the aviation industry in India.,"Up until the start of this year I used to fly only on Jet, unless circumstances dictated otherwise. 
I rarely travelled on Indigo, Spice or GoAir. 
Fuck man I miss jet and more importantly I’m pissed at this shithole of an industry. The low cost model has almost conclusively destroyed the scope for any other form of air travel. There is Vistara but it hardly services the destinations that indigo and spice do, and not as frequently either. 
I flew on spice yesterday and it’s safe to say that it ranks high on my worst air travel experiences, and this includes having to sit at Mumbai airport because my KF flight was delayed twice due to technical difficulties. 
The seats were stiff is wood, and there was near zero space for legroom and a really shitty seat pitch. Cabin crew? Cold and unfriendly. 
Don’t even mention boarding. Whenever I fly from Chennai, check in at the indigo counter feels like I’m trying to board an unreserved compartment in a railway. Too many people too less counters, and an “only baggage drop” sign that’s basically a giant public fuck you to anybody who did a web check in. Indigo consistently ranks as the worst flying experience in India you could opt for. 
All I ask for is an airline that has a good legroom, a comfortable seat and decent food. Not to mention a boarding process that is hassle free. Why is it the we can’t have a decently premium airline like in Europe, America or even Asia? They all have low cost options(Ryan, Air Asia etc) but they all have premium airlines as well(Delta, KLM, Singapore etc). India has fuck all. I feel that due to the large middle class it caters to, the aviation industry has generalised and ended up eliminating the needs of a considerable class of flyers that have a sizeable disposable income. 
Then there’s also “why should I pay more when coach lands at the same time as first, aka my dad” like just fuck that attitude sometimes. People who travel for business and take same day/ two day flights would benefit from comfort so much. We shouldn’t have to be treated as degenerate travellers just cause we wanted to save a bit.",cjsfwh,,false,/r/india/comments/cjsfwh/im_fed_up_with_the_aviation_industry_in_india/,Non-Political

She had 2 recent surgeries - one for her back and one in her leg and had just began to walk normally without any support. She had resumed office recently about a month back.

Yesterday evening when she was returning home at about 7.30 PM, Two men on a bike approached her when she was just a few steps away from her home, the society road was also deserted. 

One of them asked her for an address and when she started explaining how to get there, the other fellow snatched her gold chain. The chain didn't break and they started the bike. She fell down and was dragged for a few feet. She got hurt in her neck and has bruises on lower back and legs.

She doesn't know the registration number of the bike, these incidents are very common in our area and city. I am very sad and angry. What kind of sick mentality would you have to physically abuse an old lady ? Those criminals are roaming around freely and will continue to do the same again.

'Ghulam Fareed' dasse ki raaz o yaar  
ethse bhul gaye sugad siyaane o yaar

Every dog loves you the same no matter if she is a pedigree or an Indie , we need to break away from the biasness we have held towards our dogs &amp; that streeties dont deserve a home .
I dont think that it should be relevant but our streeties have taken over instagram too making us proud , 
I have started volunteering here &amp; I think its a worthy &amp; noble cause , we have Ngo's to take care of pets who are abondaned but anybody who has been to even one understands that its not exactly a place for any living being , to give an eg even one diseased dog can pass on his disease to several , though very well intentioned many places lack the resources &amp; manpower to continue thier operations in an efficient manner leaving the dogs prone to many more hardships .
Not to point fingers but Yulin makes us hate Chinese's guts but we have to look at our ourselves and understand that we too have a problem , we might not be eating them ( though many reports have come up in the recent past ) but we are smothering them in our own ways .

Please dont consider this as self promotion , they are not asking for donations ( though eventually a point comes where every community driven project needs to cover costs ) just that if you believe that dogs in India need help please spread the word . Thank you for your time , reddit India

I don't know much about India, but in Mumbai I am familiar with the Bombay Chamber Orchestra (amateur orchestra running for ~57 years, I perform with them), and the Symphony Orchestra of India (professional orchestra running for ~13 years). I also have a couple of friends who participate in the India National Youth Orchestra.

In fact, as it turns out, the BCO was the inaugural orchestra for the opening of Tata Theater at NCPA - yet somehow (no doubt internal politics at NCPA) they hardly perform much at NCPA. Sad state of affairs. The BCO was kept running almost single-handedly by one woman named Jini Dinshaw, and 57 years is an amazing commitment to this ensemble. She's nearly 90 and still teaches and performs.

Are there other ensembles I should follow, in Mumbai or elsewhere, who have been promoting Western classical for a long time?",ccmgon,,false,/r/india/comments/ccmgon/does_anyone_know_what_is_the_oldest_functioning/,Non-Political

I want to share an incident with you where ""India's leading bus operator **denied me medical help after accident** and **left me bleeding &amp; dying**.

I recently met with a bus accident while travelling in Orange Tours &amp; Travels bus on 1st July, early morning. The bus hit the divider and due to that I got severly injured and was stranded bleeding at a remote location where there was no mobile network. The bus customer service denied me medical help and I somehow reached Adilabad Dist. Hospital on my own.  No ambulance or police came to provide me or other passengers  medical help despite repeated intimations till two hours after the accident.  I want to share this incident with you so that no other passenger will suffer the same fate as mine. I went through previous accident cases of this India's leading bus operators and found that they had denied medical help to other passengers also. 

I had narrated my ordeal in this blog -[https://medium.com/@arpits112/indias-leading-orange-bus-services-left-me-bleedigng-and-denied-medical-help-after-accident-469745291702](https://medium.com/@arpits112/indias-leading-orange-bus-services-left-me-bleedigng-and-denied-medical-help-after-accident-469745291702)

1563032433,Ash_Sss,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ccqp9z/advice_needed_for_bschool/,1,9,,,Advice needed for B-School.,"I am doing a Bsc in Information Technology from a reputed college, placements are decent in our college, last year average was 4.5 lacs and highest was 18 lacs, this sounds pretty good for a college with very low fees but i don't see myself doing something in IT field, i cleared the entrances for VIT,KIIT,SRM,Manipal,COMEDK and few others but i did not join any of them for the very same reason, i was pushed into science by my parents and they were also forcing me to join KIIT(which i still can join) but i convinced them somehow for a Bsc as placements in KIIT were not as tempting as they had expected. I choose Bsc due to it's short duration, cost effectiveness and  curriculum was not much different from engineering if you don't include first year of engineering. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's a relief for me that i only have to study 3 years in Bsc, now coming to the main question, at the end of three years, an MBA seems to me to be the most plausible way of getting out of this mess, my previous academics (10th,12th) are good and i can also score good my graduation.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - Choose Bsc over Btech (don't like either of the two), want to do an mba.

&amp;#x200B;

Now these are my questions :-

1) Does doing a Bsc instead of a Btech will have a negative impact during admission in B-Schools?

2) Are all these great packages that the top B-School pride themselves on are only for IITs/NITs graduates etc? 

3) What would you recommend for a person in a situation like this?

&amp;#x200B;

If not top IIMs, i can surely get in top 10 schools.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S - 1)My parents wanted me to do graduation only in CS,IT or Electronics, i have also cleared few entrances for BBA.

2) Money is not a problem, i'm open to all suggestions.

3) I want to go for a degree just after Bsc and don't want to work.",ccqp9z,,false,/r/india/comments/ccqp9z/advice_needed_for_bschool/,Non-Political

It's been going on in my mind for few weeks. I feel heart breaking lonely no matter where I am or with whom I am.

I am partying with my friends but deep down I feel lonely.

I am at a family event with all the great cousins and other family members but deep down I feel lonely.

Sometime I lock myself for entire Saturdays and Sundays. My friends call but I don't go, even if I go they keep asking whats wrong, I just say I'm in bad mood. I keep watching Netflix and YouTube for hours and I feel horrible.

I workout but I am so mentally exhausted I sit between reps brain fogged I forget the set count which frustrates me more.

I had Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) two years ago by a Psychiatrist/Psychologist (I don't remember) for depression, which was due to inability to find a job. But now I don't know.

All aspects of my life is great. No money problem, no personal issues, no professional issues. no relationship issues.

Would love any suggestion, will update back if it helps. Thanks",ck3bc0,,false,/r/india/comments/ck3bc0/what_do_you_do_when_you_feel_lonely_in_the_crowd/,Non-Political

I was feeling horny so I hit up several escort services via WhatsApp. Keep in mind, I am a tourist and a foreigner, so I'm not very familiar with how locals do thing. It's story time.

So, it was the usual, we set a time and a meeting place. I asked the service guy if he accepted euros, he said yes, which was awesome, and he said it was 100 EUR for 3 hours, which seemed like a bargain to me. He also assured me that the girl would be the same as in the picture, and she was smoking.

The time comes. I go down to my apartment block, and sure enough there's a car waiting for me. The window rolls down and inside there are 3 guys. I don't see the girl yet. The guy sticks his hand out, and I hand him the bills. They start playing with it, presumedly trying to check if it's real or not (as if they'd know). 

Then, the guy asks for a security deposit. I say, what for? He says, it's to ensure the safety of the girl in case there's a second person in the room. Shit makes no sense at all, but in the moment my mind was blank. I said I didn't have any more money with me (I have 300 EUR for the trip and I didn't want to waste more on a girl). The girl from the back starts yelling in Hindi, which I don't understand. 

The guy presses me to go back to the room and get more money for the security deposit, even though I told him I didn't have any. He then began asking in a mocking tone ""why you getting a girl if you don't have any money?""

Finally, he changed his tone and said ""wait, let me ask my boss what to do"". I backed away from the window. He drove away, and yelled, very clearly, ""CHOOT"", which I understood perfectly. I was pissed as fuck so I began taking pictures of the car. The car stopped to a halt. Scared for my life, I ran back inside the apartment building, and asked a guard to escort me back to my flat.

I texted the guy on WhatsApp: ""I got your license plate number and I know your face, I'll be filing a police report on you"". No reply. I checked the photos: they were too blurry and the license plate number could not be discerned, sadly. However, I am sure if anyone else tries booking a girl via the same number, they will get scammed too.

100 EUR is not insignificant to me. I was really stressed and it was a fair price to pay to unwind with a chick for a night, but I'm not ready to get scammed such a large amount. My question is, what next? Police report or something? Will that even work? Am I putting myself in danger if I pursue this?

Thank you for any and all advice.",ckcx7x,,false,/r/india/comments/ckcx7x/got_scammed_in_delhi_by_an_escort_service_need/,Non-Political

Recently the cumulative results of past 4 semester got announced and it might surprise you knowing that over 60% of students of my specialization are having a backlog. Apparently kids at such colleges are supposed to be brightest of the bunch but that's certainly not the case. The thing is it's not that the students are lacking in academics it's actually out professors who deliberately fail students. Some infamous subjects in my College have people from batches of decades ago come in to give the reappear examination. 

We're helpless neither we can report it to our HoD nor to the director because every professor is a government employee and in the end we all have to bore the brunt.

So I have done my MBA from a relatively newer IIM (17-19 Batch) with majors in finance and marketing I got placed in leading bank as a relationship manager which was the third company on campus.I always wanted either a marketing or consultant profile but our placement committee had informed us that not many good consulting or marketing firms would visit the campus and hence we should not miss out on any opportunity and hence i did not take any chance and got placed. However after i got placed several good companies both in marketing and consulting did visit our campus,but due to the one person one job policy of the college i could not sit in any of them. Now i am stuck with a sales profile which neither has good package or a great location.Its not that I hate sales but it's just that I don't want to be stuck in sales profile for life which I would be at my current job.So i am thinking of quitting the job and am actively applying for both consultant and marketing roles however it is difficult getting shortlisted as i am a fresher and on top of that most companies do not prefer some one who has left his job early to join them as i got to know in the interview( one of the few place where i got shortlisted) which i gave.I would be highly grateful if you folks here can provide some guidance for me.",cc7ws3,,false,/r/india/comments/cc7ws3/needed_career_advice/,Non-Political

I still live with my parents, on summer break until mid September when uni starts again. My relationship with my father has been uneasy for a few years now, and a part of my mind gets uneasy when he enters the room. I'm starting to hate weekends as a result of it because he's always around and I don't feel comfortable. My father's the kind of parent who gets under your skin and makes you question your worth every second. I'm not sure if I'm going insane and falling prey to self doubt/madness, but I'm sick and tired of being fearful of him.

He's not the kind of guy you can talk with either- he's the embodiment of the silent, stoic, ""if you cry you're a weak little shit"" man. Heck, very rarely he still throws a hit or two. I'm smart and hit good grades and passes, but because I'm not a doctor like him and don't hit high 90s, he and my mum belittle me for it, often calling me things like a failure as I eat a meal. I can't count the amount of times every bit I took felt like getting choked from behind because of how he'd say such things as I eat dinner or lunch. When we were on holiday in Cyprus a few weeks ago, we were in a dispute about something I can't remember, but the one thing he said that stuck with me since was that I will never be good enough for him. I felt like I couldn't speak or breathe for a few days, but realized that a good thing came out of it- that I no longer have to worry about impressing him. 

I don't know how get strong enough to fight back. Because if I explain myself or ask why he's this way, because it's an Indian family it's seen as disrespect or talking back for some twisted reason. My parents basically want to suppress me (and my little brother) into submission using constant reminders of how inadequate we are, and I hate it. 

Those of you on here who had fathers like that, how did you deal with it? I need help, I feel like I've now been cornered against a wall and this time there really is no escape.",ccdalg,,false,/r/india/comments/ccdalg/indian_men_who_grew_up_scared_of_their_fathers/,Non-Political

Awhile back I started watching some Indian TV Dramas which I describe as being ''so bad that they are good''. Anyway I stumbled across an actor known as Siddharth Nigam who is probably my favorite foreign actor.

Has anyone ever met him in person and if so, what is he like ?",ch9afi,,false,/r/india/comments/ch9afi/has_anyone_ever_met_siddharth_nigam_if_so_what_is/,Non-Political

So this has bugged me a lot and is something I can’t find any answers to. I travel on the Mumbai/Bombay Suburban Railway quite a lot. I pass by several areas that I take for granted and recently learned about these places’ history and their Anglicized names: like Charni Road was *Churney Road*, Mahalaxmi was *Mahaluckshmee*, Bori Bandar was *Boree Bunder,* Kalyan was *Cullianne*, and Palasdhari was *Padusdhurree*. 


Then I started looking more into it, and I discovered more occurrences, like the Narmada being called “*Nerbudda*”, and Hindus being called “*Gentoos*”. However, I noticed that despite none of these anglicized names being used today, names like “*Ganges*” and “*Indus*” are still used along with the transliterated/Indic-spelled names Ganga and Sindhu.

When it comes to city names like *Bombay* becoming Mumbai and *Calcutta* becoming Kolkata, I understand that this was due to an official governmental name change, which were announced and done on paper, which can be pinpointed on a map/timeline (like Bombay → Mumbai in 1997.) 

So my question is: with all these Anglicized names being used for centuries in annals, ship logs and records, when and why did India abruptly switch to current naming conventions? At what point did Indian English deem transliteration more acceptable.",chbngm,,false,/r/india/comments/chbngm/when_did_india_stop_using_anglicized_names_and/,Non-Political

I didn't have a lot of friends back then and I didn't want my family to get close and figure out what a loser i was. My thought process at the time was that I will get through this rough patch on my own and then reconnect with my family once I'm in a more sorted place overall. It's been more than 5 years since then and I still didn't reach a 'sorted place' and im more distant than I ever was.     

I keep shunning my parents when they try to have a conversation with me, avoid any calls from relatives to the point no one even wants to talk to me anymore. More than anything I hate the fact that it's been literally years since I've talked to my grandparents. Some of my favorite memories are with my grandparents. The memories aren't of some grand event or celebration, it's just the seemingly trivial things - like when we had breakfast together in the verandah, getting to stay awake late in the night and just listening to all the grownups talk while I sipped on tea during the winter nights, going to McDonald's for the first time with them, you get the point. These seemingly normal and unimportant things are the happiest memories I hold and cherish.  I want nothing more to be a kid again and relive these times but of course that's not possible.     

Now my grandparents are very old and not in the best health and my biggest fear is they will pass away before my sorry ass gathers the courage to reconnect with them and let them know how much they mean to me. I am more of a loser than I ever was before and I'm still afraid of coming forward and looking like a loser to my grandparents. I know objectively it doesn't make much sense to be in this rut and I should just break it, but honestly it's a very very difficult thing to do. I just hope I can gather the courage before it's too late.   
  
Update: I did end up calling my grandparents in the afternoon. It was a basic 'How are you', 'How are studies going' conversation but it has made me happier than I have been in years. Thanks for the encouragement guys, your nudge was all that I needed to make a very very positive change in my life.",chdj8q,,false,/r/india/comments/chdj8q/late_night_regrets/,Non-Political

It may not arrive in brand new condition.","I ordered a lot of books (manga and full scifi/fantasy novels) (about Rs. 20k order value) from Amazon recently. I have only received the first part of the order today.

I received Gene Mapper (Fujii Taiyo) and RG Veda Omnibus vols 1, 2 &amp; 3 (CLAMP) today. The books arrived in a less than stellar condition, to the extent that they might even be second hand or poorly stored! My copies of Cardcaptor Sakura's omnibus editions which I bought circa 2013 are in much better shape!

All of them have completely worn out covers, with smudge, grime and scuff marks all over. Bits of the cover print have also worn off. The page edges also appear to have ageing stains. The thick books were packed in a shoddy manner so the corners are bent.

Amazon customer service can only offer full returns, and won't give partial refunds. That leaves me with a major problem. I don't know where else to get these books at a competitive price. Sapnaonline is more expensive by Rs. 1000 for volume 2, and Flipkart is Rs. 600 more expensive for each volume.

The Amazon sellers were uRead and Amazing-Buy. I suspect they're actually the same seller since their prices are always identical, both have practically the same inventory in stock, and their parts of the order were processed together.",chdvin,,false,/r/india/comments/chdvin/psa_when_ordering_relatively_obscure_books_on/,Non-Political

[Gpay Scam](https://i.redd.it/57zpa9o5mfc31.jpg)

They insist on using GPay as they are unable to use netbanking for whatever reason. Then they cleverly write ""Credit to account for xxxx"" under the amount and send the request. For a new person who doesn't understand much he will read credit to account and think its message from app (not the person) and press the button when in reality they requested the money. And so money is gone. Can't do anything now.

He was against dowry in the beginning of the marriage proceedings but somehow came to find out that the girl had a boyfriend whom she broke off like a year ago. The dowry price went from ₹0 to ₹50 lakhs.

After that, her spiteful boyfriend also leaked her nudes so the dowry price went from ₹50lakhs to ₹1 crore. He is an educated guy who has connections so he promised the girl's father that somehow he will ensure that her ex-bf who leaked her nudes gets jail time and remove all those pics from the internet BUT and this is a big BUT they have to provide him with a car.

You would have seen such pages. The most recent one I outed was during the IPL where the page had multiple posts and stories showing ""proof"" of the earnings he had given his clients in the Rs.30,000-70,000 range. His MO? On paying him Rs 2000, he gives you ""Optimum"" Dream11 team, using which you are guaranteed winnings of 20,000+. 

A common red flag for these pages is the disabling of comments on the posts. All communication is via DM only. So, me being me, I slide into them DMs and start inquiring about the hows and whats of the deal, as a genuine customer. They begin their pitch, sell it, and then ask for payment. 9 times out of 10, payment is via UPI/PayTM, and hence linked to a mobile number. A quick TruCaller search reveals the name and identity of the person running the scam. I then send them a DM saying that I have complained to the cyber cell about their scam and they should be getting a call soon. At this point they think I'm bluffing, usually get on the offensive and start abusing me while giving blind threats. I then address them by their  full name, mention their address (it's unbelievable how easy it is to find information on FB), and state that these details have been submitted to the CyberCell. 

Two hours later, the Instagram account is usually deleted and no longer found.

On asking him about which order had won me the same, he said he couldn’t disclose it after which I told him I’m not interested. He then abused me which after which I dropped the call.

Today I again received another fraud call stating I’ve won ₹1200000 today from Amazon, I promptly told him to enjoy the winnings and cut the call.

Both people were calling from Airtel Numbers registered in Bihar, and the funny thing is the number their calling on is only used for delivery updates on Amazon and I actually bought some stuff a few days ago.

However, I seemed to come out of it a few months later and am thankfully at a much better place now and my mood has improved overall. One day I had watched [a video](https://youtu.be/cL5CPt9_Ox8) of a woman describing her Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) and out dawned on me that I may have something similar to this (not diagnosing myself clinically). I do hate cold and overcast skies and absolutely love the sun and summer, even though it got really hot this time reaching temperatures constantly above 40°C. Now that the monsoon has come in my area, I'm starting to feel the low moods and anxiety getting more frequent again.

Has anyone else experienced the same?

so far my company has been supportive when i said i need 1 month off, but i am getting worried i will get laid off if i don't recover in time. is there anything legally that would protect my job? my job offer says they can terminate my employment at will so i don't know if i have any protection. i am planning to get a letter from my doctor that i can't walk for x months.

any advice?

Today went to fill petrol in 2 wheeler filled 150 ka fuel in it. The next guy behind me was on sports bike and asked for 1000 Rs ka fuel. As you guessed he only filled 850 Rs ka fuel since he was busy setting map on his hud mounted phone. Another car rolled in and this dude asked for 3000 ka fuel and you guessed it only got 2000 Rs worth of fuel. The car dude realised that since that much fuel should fill full his car but it didn’t.  They got in an argument and the manager was called. But the asshole manager blames the customer for falsefing it and his employee is honest guy and all others just watched doing nothing. Tried to support the car guy but the manager was like maj nahi karne ka nahi to mehenga padega.  The car guy had no choice but to roll away since no one wants to deal with the local mob. The fuel bitch then proceeded to do the same scam again with other vehicles.                                                                           
                           This is just fucked up man. Like are these fuel dudes taught to do these scams and they get a cut out of it ?

I am planning to travel to Spiti with a group of friends from South India. This will be the first trip to the Himalayas for some of us (including me). I need suggestions to help me plan. We were planning to arrive at Delhi via flight and head from there to either Manali and Shimla to start our trip. We are planning to book a package from there as none of us know driving and only few of us can ride a bike. Duration would be 8-9 days. 

Had a few questions in this regard:
1- Many tour operators sell an itinerary that starts from Shimla and ends at Manali, covering the entire Spiti circuit (Kinnaur valley and Spiti). Should we do this or only do the Manali-Spiti-Manali circuit? I am not a big fan of spot covering and want to spend time in a beautiful place, absorb and relax, so the latter seems to be a better option. Is it worth to do the entire circuit in 9 days?

2- We are planning mostly road trips and don't expect a lot of trekking to be involved. Will Altitude/Mountain sickness be a concern, given we will be travelling at around 12-15k feet a lot?

3- Can you suggest good tour operators with a good safety and reliability record (money is not a big concern as long as the services are good).

4- Are rainfall and landslides a concern in this area given August is a monsoon month?

Hello! I've noticed how little coverage there is of climate change in mainstream media, and how it often gives the impression that it's a far away thing that doesn't affect us (though that is slowly changing). 

My friends and I are a bunch of law students who have started a weekly newsletter to help you keep up with the important climate related news and help analyse it. We're still in the beta edition, so we would appreciate feedback as well. The newsletter will be delivered every Sunday.

My family was so poor, for most of my school years I went door to door selling stuff. I was never smart, average and below average at best. My only bragging point is I never needed tuition to pass school (Reality-  no Money for it). I was a sickly kid, went months with breathing problems and family couldn't afford the surgery to fix it. Now I am 24 years old. I am going to have to work back breaking and mundane work for a long time. I will never have time for a social life. Not likely to have much friends or a family. Will have to spend most of my time, travelling from place to place. No time for passions or luxuries. Never really drink or spend money unnecessarily so not much of a problem. I have about 1 hour a day free from working at best. No weekends. I have no permanent home. My family has nothing to leave me.



I am college educated and have a master's degree. So there is a chance I can get myself into a middle class life. It's still sad though. It's unlikely I will ever be able to enjoy my twenties or even thirties. My life will be traveling from one job to the other. Clients are assholes and everyone is your enemy.

Is this really all worth it? There's no guarantee I will live to my 40's especially living in India. Anything could happen in between. The best years of my life will disappear behind me and pass me by. Wish I had been born well off or even just middle class. Atleast I could have gotten to enjoy my childhood atleast. It's a sad world we live in. Guess we have no choice but to live it. 


But anytime, I hear rich randians bitching about paying taxes. It makes my blood boil. You fuckers have no clue how well you have it. I wish most of you actually took your threats of emigration and did it. Atleast then, other people can get a chance to rise up.

1562767970,ProfessorGoosebumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cbh7lp/mumbais_new_parking_rule_fine_upto_15000_for/,0,6,,,"Mumbai's new parking rule - Fine upto ₹15,000 for wrong parking.","BMC recently announced a new rule for parking in Mumbai. Targeting areas with traffic congestion and those with availability of public parking lots (paid or free), the fines for parking your vehicle in a no parking spot would attract hefty fines **upto** **₹15,000** starting 7th July ([TOI link](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-park-illegally-pay-up-to-rs-15000-from-sunday/articleshow/70099436.cms))

The rule says that fine may be imposed to anyone parking illegally within 500 m radius of a public parking spot. So far, 26 such PPLs have been identified by the BMC. (*List below*). I think this is a good rule to ease the roads from traffic congestion. Parking on wrong spots has been a huge traffic menace that leads to jams and ends up wasting many man-hours.

But some people are voicing out their opinions against it ([TOI link](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-locals-protest-against-bmcs-new-parking-rule/articleshow/70141899.cms)). One major concern is that this fine cannot be afforded by the poor and middle class citizens and second is that there is no infrastructure to support the 30 lakh odd cars that Mumbai city has. So such a rule should ideally be preceded by infrastructure improvement.

But in BMC's defence, the fines will be levied only in those zones that have an availability of public parking lots, not the whole city. Its a good place to start with.

What do you guys feel about this? Is this a good step or you feel this is rushed?

1563518082,HANDSOME_RHYS,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cf43vu/unpopular_opinion_the_future_of_indias_clean/,63,104,,,Unpopular Opinion: The future of India's clean energy Hybrids and EVs looks bleak to me,"I know the Govt. has been pushing to increase EVs' penetration in India substantially as soon as possible because our air quality has become easily the world's most polluted, but given the state of things, both politically and technologically, it seems like an impossible task right now.

Nitin Gadkari said earlier last year,

&gt; “There is no need for any policy now. The electric vehicle (EV) standards finalized by Niti Aayog will be used as final benchmark.”

Vice Chairman of Niti Ayog:

&gt; “We need a policy to put it all together (charging infrastructure, battery swapping) and we can’t just have people running around on their own and ministries working in silos.""

Piyush Goyal, now the Minister of Coal and railways stated that the Prime Minister had constituted a core group of senior ministers to “lead the initiative and make sure that by 2030, most, if not all, vehicles in India are powered by electricity.”

He himself was rebutted by his colleague, Babul Supriyo, when he responded with a written reply in Lok Sabha that there was no deadline specified and his ministry of heavy industries &amp; public enterprises was given no timeframe for 100% electric mobility.

All of these contradictory statements by different departments of the Government has thrown the entire automobile sector in a state of confusion. Are we going to do it? Are we not going to do it? What are the exact goals? Because the goals, as specified by Piyush Goyal, are delusional at best and you cannot magically convert **most** Indian vehicles plying on the road today into electrical vehicles by 2030. It doesn't take one to be a CEO of one of the leading automobile manufacturing companies to see that.

Apart from that, most of India's electricity comes from burning fossil fuel. It's not clean energy. So what are we even fighting for? That would just mean that implementation of these schemes coercing people to buy EVs would only move the pollution off city roads to its hinterlands, where that power is generated.

Let's talk about FAME II now- As MD, Bajaj Auto, Rajiv Bajaj, put it, ""They're putting the cart before the horse."" As in, seeking to accelerate manufacturing in India without ensuring there is adequate demand for the electric and hybrid vehicles so produced. Only buses priced up to ₹2 crore, strong and plug-in hybrids under ₹15 lakh, three-wheelers under ₹5 lakh and two-wheelers under ₹1.5 lakh will be eligible for incentives. In face of the potential and present dire consequences, India should be doing even better than US and Norway and go out of it's way to incentivize EVERY GODDAMN Hybrid and EV under the sun (pun intended). Every single one of them. Western countries aren't making their citizens breathe air that is multiple times more dangerous than recommended for a normal human to intake and they still offer more generous subsidies and invest tons more in awareness programs for the same.

FAME II will also offer incentives to manufacturers, who invest in developing electric vehicles and its components, including lithium-ion batteries and electric motors since developing li-ion batteries (used both in EVs and PHEVs) are very expensive to manufacture in India because lithium is not produced in India. On the other hand, China produces batteries en-masse but the citizens and their representatives in the houses today are more concerned about China getting India's balls in a vice over it's over-reliance on China for it's automobile sector's crucial driving force (quite literally) than coughing their lungs out. Needless to say, PRIORITIES ARE FLAWED.

I do not understand why Hybrids are so far out of the reach of the average Indian buyer today, even though that tech came to India way before EVs. As explained above, EVs are still too costly to produce in India because of lack of local lithium production, are impractical to buy with a purpose of making the air cleaner because India burns fossil fuels anyways to produce most of it's electricity and no feasible charging network exists even in most metropolitan cities for anyone to even consider it as an incentive to buy these vehicles. In that case, a typical middle-class person concerned about environment would be left with only Hybrids for options. But if you do some research, it seems almost no attractive options other than a Maruti Ciaz are available for him/her out in the market to buy a Hybrid. Hybrids are way more fuel efficient and less-polluting than your normal IC engines. FAME II is also known to offer incentives on them. So why is that? They don't even need specialized charging stations like EVs so it's beyond me why manufacturers have forsaken them. Maybe it has something to do with the worldwide trend of moving to SUVs as the most popular choice of transportation, offered even to the lower-tier customer base.

So to summarize, the Government doesn't really know what it wants or what it's doing apart from the end goal and an all-over-the-place FAME scheme it has no idea how to execute, that confuses the automobile manufacturers and they're not bringing their EVs into the Indian market as they see working on complying to BS VI norms as the safest bet right now, India's tendency to burn fossil fuels to generate electricity and old, outdated grids that eliminate all possibility of setting up government-endorsed at-home chargers, slow development of public fast chargers due to lack of manufacturers' interest in introducing EVs (or introducing affordable Hybrids even, for that matter), government's ""selective"" incentives on EVs and hybrids causing the rich, who are usually at the forefront of all new automobile tech introduced in a country and become the trendsetters, to look at IC engine vehicles as better alternatives and lack of local lithium production despite incentives.

No wonder India's not making any strides in it's overly-ambitious but poorly implemented goals for cleaner air.

Reasonable thoughts and discussions are welcome. On the other hand, if you have an overly-optimistic, dreamy-eyed opinion which has nothing to do with ground reality or logic in general, you can kindly go hang.",cf43vu,,false,/r/india/comments/cf43vu/unpopular_opinion_the_future_of_indias_clean/,Policy/Economy

Pakistan lost almost 20% of its textile industry to bangladesh in past few years while  India dosen't seem to have benefitted from it.

Similarly, american trade war with China is forcing many companies to shift part of their industries to Thailand, Vietnam etc while none of them seem to be planning anything in India?

What is the issue? What are we doing wrong?

## Highlights

* **Background:** On June 28, 2019, the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) invited bids from reputed turnkey solution providers for the implementation of a centralised Automated Facial Recognition System (AFRS).
* **Need for established safeguards:** The proposal to introduce facial recognition into society currently comes with a variety of concerns that need to be addressed first. We write a legal notice to the NCRB  with also a covering letter and a copy of the notice to Home Minister, Shri. Amit Shah and Home Secretary, Shri. Rajiv Gauba, highlighting the features and scope of the AFRS and its unfathomable detriment it could bring about to Indians if implemented.

## Know your enemy

Its important to understand the characteristics the Request for Proposals requires the systems to possess, in order to understand how problematic it will be. Our legal notice highlights features which will be covered here in brief to provide basic context.

1. *Function:* The AFRS is intended to be a repository of all crime and criminal related facial data and should be able to identify or verify a person from a variety of inputs ranging from images to videos.
2. *Integration:* The system should be able to be integrated with various other databases such as ICJS, CCTNS, IVFRT, state police integration software in existence or any others. The integration does not stop there, it requires the system to be compatible with other biometric solutions such as Iris and AFIS but doesn't specify what these databases are. Might we have yet another Aadhaar worry to add to our frown lines?
3. *Identification:* As per requirements of the RFP, the system should not only be able to match images from a variety of databases, it should also be equipped to capture images from CCTV footage, public or private video feeds. As concerning as this sounds, there's more. It should also have the ability to tag images uploaded from newspapers, raids, sketches etc. with identifiers based on sex, age, scars, tattoos, consider landmarks, features and contours in identifying individuals and also accommodate for images with plastic surgery and make up for accuracy in identification.
4. *Technical requirements:* The aspects that stuck out in the RFP largely related to the need for the system to be compatible with bio-metric solutions such as Iris and Fingerprint identification systems. It also requires there that there be security in storage, user access and authentication
5. *Security requirements:* The bidder is largely responsible for additional measures in maintaining the integrity, confidentiality and availability of data that will be stored, apart from the established ISO standard prescribed in the RFP.

## Here's why we aren't quite ready for sci-fi

We take a closer look at these *not so frightening* features and identify concerns with the entire technology itself.

* *Absence of legality:* The requirement of facial recognition systems does not stem from a statutory basis nor is it a result of the executive power of the Government. Clearly it lacks any sort of legal backing. This is in addition to the violation of privacy it will so flagrantly undermine as it fails to fulfil any of the elements laid down by Puttaswamy v. Union of India (2017 (10) SCALE 1) in permitting a violation of privacy.
* *Manifest arbitrariness:* Beginning to picture the massive invasion of privacy the AFRS will potentially have? Especially with its all seeing eye looking at not only databases  and databases of images but also strategically located CCTV footage, images of newspaper clippings, raids, sketches etc., all most likely without your knowledge. This kind of en-masse surveillance is bound to bring about a high degree of damage. Studies by MIT and Georgetown and trials conducted the London Metropolitan Police acknowledge that pervasive biases that exist currently within our societies are likely to be mimicked by the algorithms within these systems. Mis-identification and discriminatory profiling is the result we're looking at if these systems are implements. Apparently, the already existing discriminatory practices perpetuated by human beings is no longer enough, we must look to AI to continue our dirty work.
* *Absence of safeguards and accountability:* In light of the above, there is currently no legal restrictions or limitations to this technology to ensure its proportional use or afford protection to those it interacts with. Add facial recognition to the on going debate on CCTVs and we have ourselves a full fledged mix of India and China no longer being restricted to the Indo-Chinese cuisine.

Considering the trajectory India appears to be on with mass surveillance and technological perpetuating of discrimination, a scarier version of the Orwellian dystopia seems to be right up our alley. We urge the NCRB to take a step back and recall the bidding process for the Automated Facial Recognition System until adequate safeguards that address these various concerns are put into place. This request is also with a disclaimer that failure to do so may cause us to seek remedy in accordance with the law.

**Highlights**

* **Background:** While the Draft Personal Data Protection Bill marinates with new and improved changes privy to no one, an issue of transparency that has consistently been raised, the growing risks to the data of Indian citizens only continues to increase in number.
* **Immediate need for a Data Protection Framework:** We wrote a representation to the Hon'ble Minister for Electronics and Information Technology asking on the status of the much awaited Data Protection Bill. More importantly what it will look like and why it should be made public prior to it's introduction in parliament.
* **Thank you parliamentarians:** We also wrote to close to ten parliamentarians for not only opposing the Aadhaar Amendment Bill but asking for a rights focused data protection law.

### Running out of time but never out of slime - new and improved ways to threaten your personal data

With great power, comes great responsibility. The stream of new technologies continuous to remind us of the various ways we are currently left vulnerable only solidifying our need for a data protection law.

In light of this, we wrote to Minister of Electronics and Information Technology, Shri. Ravi Shankar Prasad on the immediate need for a data protection law ([**Read here for more**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x9DGhuz_f372rzIqFc-Jwmhx50ieIZHM/view?usp=sharing)).

Right now India is under a privacy onslaught. This comes from several government policies and programs. Here are a few select ones:

1. *Facial Recognition:* On June 28, 2019, the NCRB released a call for tender, inviting bidders to provide Automated Facial Recognition Systems (AFRS) with the intention of creating a repository of “crime and criminal facial data”. The RFP for AFRS is alarming; it furthers critical privacy violations large-scale surveillance and also discriminatory profiling.
2. *CCTV:* Delhi has recently had the “privilege” of installing over 1.4 lakh CCTV all over the city with the intention of providing security to women. The project is itself illegal as it has no statutory basis to substantiate the violation of privacy under Puttaswamy v. Union of India. In addition, there is an absolute lack of transparency in the manner in which this project is advancing but questions of the protection of the storage, accessibility and security of such footage continues to remain answered.
3. *Social media linking:* To add to the dynamic nature of our current concerns, an order was released by the Indian Higher Education Secretary asking students to link their social media accounts to all higher education institutes (HEI) as well as the Ministry of Human Resource and Development (HRD) without regard for the privacy of students and its impact on their freedom of speech and expression.
4. *National Economic Survey:* While an entire chapter in the survey has been dedicated to purely data, the approach is extremely concerning. Following the narrative set by the Draft National Economic Policy, it treats data as a public good which is at the disposal of the Government to be used in a manner it deems fit. This understanding is fundamentally incorrect as it does not recognise that ownership should remain in the hands of an individual.

The Draft Personal Data Bill has still not made its way to Parliament. In addition, there is no transparency on the actual content of the Bill in its current form ([**Read our post on this**](https://internetfreedom.in/lest-we-consult-too-much/)).  As we emphasised in the representation, India appears to be settling in quite well within the definition of a digital dystopia.

It is with these chilling concerns that we reach out to the Ministry on the immediate need for the Data Protection framework, one that is fully rights respecting rather than a mere after-thought. The current Draft Personal Data Protection Bill should maintain its earlier standard and its framework needs to be disclosed in order to ensure that the approach to data as is in proposals such as the Draft National E-Commerce Policy and the National  Economic Survey do not make individuals data a “public good” relinquishing the individual of control of their own data. We have requested that the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology proactively engage and ensure the essence of a data protection law as is in several other jurisdictions is maintained.

We will continue to engage with all forms of Government in ensuring India receives a data protection legislation that puts it citizens first!

https://i.redd.it/0e8et2q1km931.png

### Highlights

* **Background:** As per RTI data from BSNL, 31 cases over two years led to the blocking of more than 4000 websites in India. Most of the cases involve allegations of copyright infringement related to movies. We are making a copy of this response with the text of these orders available. BSNL has only revealed court orders but refuses to provide any directions received from the Central Government for blocking of websites and we will be filing an appeal with the CIC regarding denial of this information.
* **Lack of Due Process:** Our analysis of the court orders reveals four disturbing trends. First, the court orders permit blocking of the entire website, and not just specific URLs which host IP infringing content. Second, courts have passed the buck to ISPs to determine whether blocking websites listed by the plaintiff is necessary to prevent copyright infringement without independently verifying if these websites host infringing content. Third, interim injunctions are granted to block access to websites without providing the website owner an opportunity of being heard. Finally, Ashok Kumar orders which were intended to gather evidence against unnamed defendants are being misused for website blocking.

### Perseverance Pays Off (Partly)

After a long drawn process, BSNL has provided IFF access to court orders directing blocking of websites in 2017 and 2018. We had filed two RTI applications with BSNL on 6 March 2019 seeking information about website blocking orders issued by the Central Government and different courts. Both RTI applications were initially rejected by citing the existence of a fiduciary relationship under Section 8(1)(e) and threat to life and safety of a person under Section 8(1)(g) of the Right to Information Act, 2005. We appealed the rejection of our RTI requests, and we were partly successful because BSNL agreed to provide us access to court orders. However, it has refused to disclose website blocking orders issued by the Central Government and we intend to challenge this before the Central Information Commission (CIC) soon.

### Anatomy of a Website Blocking Court Order

We were provided access to 31 court orders in total. Out of these, 25 orders were passed by the Madras High Court and the remaining 7 orders were passed by the Delhi High Court. Almost all the court orders relate to unlicensed streaming of copyrighted films, TV shows or sports events on websites such as 123 Movies, Pirate Bay, Put Locker, Torrent etc. Approximately 3000-4000 websites were blocked by each order but there is significant overlap in the websites mentioned by different orders.

&amp;#x200B;

We analysed all 31 court orders and discovered four disturbing trends.

***(i) Whole websites, and not specific URLs are being blocked***  
All court orders relating to copyright infringement permit blocking of the whole website, and they do not limit suspension of access to specific URLs which host infringing content. The list of websites is prepared by the plaintiff with the help of paid investigative agencies and it is accepted by the court without any independent scrutiny.  
A notable exception to this trend of blocking whole websites is present in the solitary court order relating to trademark infringement which directs blocking of specific URLs selling infringing products on E-Commerce platforms like Amazon, Flipkart and Snapdeal. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine a scenario where a court would mechanically block access to the whole website of a multi billion dollar giant like Amazon. Unfortunately, file sharing platforms like Torrent which have been characterized as rogue pirates do not receive the same level of consideration.

***(ii) ISPs forced to be Judge, Jury and Executioner***  
Most court orders passed by the Madras High Court put ISPs in a tough spot because they are directed to block websites listed by the plaintiff if it is necessary to prevent copyright infringement. This is unacceptable because ISPs are not capable of making such decisions which require application of judicial mind. Whether blocking a website is necessary to prevent copyright infringement will require the ISP to evaluate the genuineness and imminence of the threat vis a vis each website. Since ISPs do not want to waste their resources on individually verifying whether infringing content exists on the thousands of websites listed by the plaintiff, they will err on the side of caution and block access to everything.  Further, there are several exceptions to copyright infringement such as fair use for educational purposes or criticism, and ISPs cannot be expected to balance competing interests to determine if the exception is applicable.

***(iii) Ex-parte orders are undermining the adversarial basis of our justice system***  
Out of 31 orders in total, 21 orders were passed without any of the defendants or their representatives present. Therefore, there was nobody present during the hearing who could challenge the plaintiff’s version. This is deeply problematic because our justice system follows an adversarial model which believes in discovering the truth through contestation between opposing parties. In the cases before the Delhi High Court, there were four types of defendants: owners of  named websites which are known to host copyright infringing content, owners of unnamed websites which may be hosting copyright infringing content but their identity is not currently known, ISPs and government bodies like Department of Telecom. However, plaintiffs who had filed their copyright infringement suits before the Madras High Court only impleaded ISPs as defendants. This means that owners of websites which are being blocked have not even been brought on record or served notice. If only ISPs are impleaded as defendants, then it is not a genuinely adversarial proceeding because as previously noted, ISPs are business entities which would prefer to err on the side of caution and they will not fight for website owners.

***(iv) Ashok Kumar orders being misutilized for website blocking***  
For everyone who isn’t an intellectual property lawyer, an Ashok Kumar order is a court order which restrains a class of persons whose identity is not yet known from infringing the plaintiff’s rights. These orders are called John Doe orders abroad.

The difference between John Doe orders and website blocking orders has been explained by [**Ananth Padmanabhan writing for CIS**](https://cis-india.org/a2k/blogs/john-doe-orders-isp-blocking-websites-copyright-1):

&gt;*“The most crucial point of distinction between these two types of orders is that while John Doe orders speak to the primary infringer, website blocking orders impose onerous responsibility on the ISP. John Doe orders as used in India thus far have served the purpose of a blanket search and seize mandate to gather evidence of direct infringement. As seen above, the final relief in the suit is granted only against those John Does who are subsequently identified and arrayed as parties to the main suit. Website blocking orders, on the other hand, amount to granting the final relief at the interim stage itself, as access is blocked to web links hosted by unknown persons by taking recourse to the ISP.”*

In some of the court orders that we analysed, the judges have failed to appreciate this distinction, and they have put the cart before the horse by directing the ISPs to block access to any infringing website upon receiving notice of the same from the plaintiff. The ISPs are required to block access even if the owner of the website was not impleaded as a named defendant or mentioned in the list of websites provided by the plaintiff to the court.

### Need for due process and proportionate solutions

On our blog, we have previously written about problems in the website blocking process under the IT Blocking Rules. Most recently, we discussed this issue in the context of [**blocking of the satirical Dowry Calculator website**](https://internetfreedom.in/blocking-of-satirical-dowry-calculator-website-prompts-us-to-take-action-whattheblock-savetheinternet/) for which we had also filed an RTI.

Our analysis of the court orders supplied by BSNL reveals that even when websites are blocked by the judiciary, there is a lack of due process and natural justice. Website owners are not given notice or hearing before grant of interim injunctions. Further, court ordered website blocking is disproportionately broad because it is not limited to specific URLs which host infringing content. File sharing platforms also host legitimate content and cutting off access to the entire website is akin to throwing the baby out with the bathwater.

The most troubling trend is the concentration of power in the hands of ISPs who are expected to block websites which may or may not be mentioned in the plaint based on whether it is ""necessary"" to prevent infringement. This means that our fundamental right to free speech which is guaranteed by Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution is left at the mercy of overly cautious and business minded ISPs. As internet users, we are often left wondering why certain websites have been blocked because the notices displayed are cryptic and inconsistent, and they do not disclose reasons for suspension of access. This lack of transparency directly impacts our right to receive information which is also a part of Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution.

This has subsequently resulted in terrorism and insurgency in majority of these countries. 

Wouldn't a solution similar to the EU work for the countries in the subcontinent with all the countries in the sub continent developing quickly, a common currency that can be used in all of these countries (since many if them hold very similar value), a free border for trade and travel that will finish off border disputes, this will reduce tensions between countries aswell.

This would reduce violence and would also keep chinese influence off of the countries in the subcontinent. Make the subcontinent ""union"" collectively much more economically and militarily stronger. Learning from the EU by not making the mistakes they did like no election of EU representatives in the EU parliament etc. Shouldn't the countries in the subcontinent look for a solution like this rather than tokenism of SAARC.",cbvqo1,,false,/r/india/comments/cbvqo1/could_a_union_of_countries_in_the_indian/,Policy/Economy

https://i.redd.it/4q2nbxj5cnc31.png

**Highlights**

* *Background:* The past few months have been full of attacks on privacy. These include the government selling vehicle registration data, introducing facial recognition technology and increasing CCTV surveillance. Unfortunately, all this is being done in the absence of any safeguards, principal amongst them is a data protection bill.
* *IFF goes to Parliament:* Dr. Ravikumar (Lok Sabha, MP from Tamil Nadu), has introduced the Personal Data and Information Privacy Code Bill, 2019 today. This is a substantive redraft of the Indian Privacy Code which puts the interests of Indian citizens first.

## Parliament gets a modern, progressive legislative proposal

August is coming! And that makes it a full year since the consultations on India’s data privacy regime were held. More than two years after the epoch defining right to privacy judgement a data protection regime seems distant. Meanwhile, surveillance grows in scope, sophistication and creep.

Since the consultations in August, 2018 there has been little movement on the Personal Data Protection Bill. But there has been a lot of activity on projects which pose massive threats to privacy ([**read more on it here**](https://internetfreedom.in/running-out-of-time-but-never-out-of-slime-new-ways-in-which-your-data-is-threatened/))! We do not know if, and when the Government will table a bill for it, and what final form it will take. This is characteristic of a process that has lacked transparency even during the proceedings of the Justice Srikrishna Expert Committee ([**read more**](https://internetfreedom.in/untitled-2/)).

Today, Dr. Ravikumar, Member of Parliament, Lok Sabha, (read more on him [**here**](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/first-constituency-then-state-nation/story-6ZrWdYrzqWouzvAVUERwlJ.html)) tabled the Personal Data and Information Privacy Code Bill, 2019. This is a private member’s bill based off a reworked, updated, Indian Privacy Code, 2018 and the 7 Privacy Principles. The public comments received on it have been factored and changes have been made. We thank for the wide ranging participation by individuals and organisations in supporting it.

## Blueprint for a rights based data protection and surveillance reform law

There is very low chance that the Personal Data and Information Privacy Code Bill, 2019 will pass into a law, but it is one more small act of faith to protect the privacy of everyday, ordinary Indians. It will hopefully provide a useful basis, for study, inspire debate by our parliamentarians who are actively engaging on issues of data protection and surveillance reform. At the time of filing, it is the only legislative proposal on this issue.

Our engagement in this effort is a continuing attempt in a range of actions across institutions which have been documented at length at the SaveOurPrivacy.in campaign website. We have in the past worked with different members of parliament and will continue to do so to advance data protection and surveillance reform. We will also post analysis on this bill, and further upload it for further public debate and discussion.

We thank not only Dr. Ravikumar but all parliamentarians, notably Dr. Abhishek Manu Singhvi, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, Anupriya Patel, Asaduddin Owaisi, D. Ravikumar, Mahua Moitra, Manish Tewari, N.K. Premachandran, Supriya Sule, who are actively engaging on the issue of data protection. (wasn’t that a long list of names? These are just the MPs who have spoken in this present session of parliament on the need for a data protection law, showing how the issues cuts across party lines)

*The All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) will not allow new conventional disciplines with low employment potential from the academic year 2020-21 and will permit only emerging fields such as Artificial Intelligence and Block chain, Lok Sabha was informed on Monday*

I found this absolutely stupid and against common sense to enforce a policy like this. One needs to investigate the reason for low employment in core engineering sectors such as Mechanical Engineering, Civil Engineering and so on before dismissing them as 'low employment potential' and jumping on the AI bandwagon. The disciplines supposedly termed as low employment are essential to the development of the countries infrastructure. Bulk of the engineers working in many of the Government PSUs, Government Engineering Research Laboratories such as DRDO and BARC, Indian Engineering Services, and even combat engineers in the army belong to these disciplines! India has never even reached the pinnacle of research in these fields to just dismiss them as not worthy of being pursued any longer. These basic engineering disciplines have always formed the cornerstone of what is considered the very mantle and basis of all engineering. Instead, the AICTE should focus on revamping the curriculum to make it more interdisciplinary and relevant to current fields. 

In my opinion by intentionally creating a surplus of engineers trained in a particular field because of an ongoing trend is only going to be detrimental in the future. I am thankful that the government actually recognises the need to advance education in these fields, but they have clearly been remiss in doing their homework on how development in education should take place. 
 There is an urgent  need to instill the importance of an interdisciplinary education and highlight the benefit of picking up transferable skills to make student across all forms of engineering more employable. We are to be blamed in the first place to have created an atmosphere where the most gratifying reward is, not academic achievement, but a fat bank balance.",cdpm3q,,false,/r/india/comments/cdpm3q/aicte_not_to_allow_low_employment_potential/,Policy/Economy

Here are the highlights,"The biggest take-away was the direct attack on what the survey calls 'Anglo-Saxon economics'. Basically the concept of a general equilibrium theory. Instead it claims an economy is always within either a 'virtous cycle' or a 'vicious cycle'. 

A virtous cycle is characterised by rising investment, rising exports and rising savings. A vicious cycle is the inverse of that. 

The implication is that the government must intervene to steady the ship and any fantasy about 'rational actors' has to be abandoned.

The importance of higher savings cannot be underestimated accoring to the survey. It is only with high and rising savings that a country can **self-finance** high investments. Otherwise it must seek out foreign savings which gets translated into a high current account deficit which in turn makes it vulnerable during times of crises. 


They survey continually made mention of China and other fast-growing East Asian economies when making its case in countless graphs. It is clear what the chief inspiration is. 

Having very high savings naturally means having a correspondingly low domestic consumption. Thus, the only way to have fast growth when domestic consumption is subdued is through fast export growth. They survey made the case that because India still has a low share of world export market so there is plenty of scope to regain, regardless of trade tensions.

The survey made many other recommendations, of which judicial reform is one which caught my one, but the overriding theme of the survey was the call to abandon 'Anglo-Saxon economics', by which it meant general equilibrium theory. 

It'll be interesting to see if India truly makes a decisive economic policy break from the past as the language suggests.",c95ykl,,false,/r/india/comments/c95ykl/i_read_the_indian_economic_survey_of_20189_so_you/,Policy/Economy

There are no two ways to put it, India’s tax on the super rich is ridiculously high. I belong to that super rich community and while paying taxes is not an issue, the amount certainly is. Money doesn’t come easy and I’ve worked hard for it. Meanwhile the government just gives us a big middle finger and increases the taxes. 

Now tell me why would anyone want to live in a developing country with such high tax rates. Before any of you’ll hark on about patriotism and bullshit like that just think logically for a second. For the amount of tax (42.7%) paid here, you can easily shift to a country with lower tax rates. And with the kind of money people from my income category have I can see a lot of them leaving this country for good. 

The government is not incentivizing individuals to become wealthy. What benefits does being wealthy in India get you? Roads are shit, public infrastructure is lacking, incredibly high taxes for luxury items, the list goes on and on.... 
Instead they want to spend my money on statues, stupid ministries like AYUSH, scams, bailing out public sector companies and stuff like that.

Worse, so much money, which I GAVE as tax is being spent to appease the vote bank. Rich farmers are not taxed because the government is afraid to lose them. The individuals and companies who pay taxes (the 1%) have absolutely no say in policies because the government wants to use the money to appease the other (99%). (The figures are just examples). We are the source of that money. India is taking a turn to the socialist era, when taxes were even more exorbitant and India was a planned economy. I just wish the government would aggressively try to increase the tax base instead of strangling those who pay tax.

EDIT- I am NOT averse to paying high taxes in general. I already elaborated that in my comment below but in India, tax does not give benefits that other countries with similar tax rates give.",ch4zwd,,false,/r/india/comments/ch4zwd/rant_indias_brutal_tax_for_the_rich/,Policy/Economy

You can read more about why we decided to intervene in this case [**here**](https://internetfreedom.in/aadhaar-linking/). There was a hearing in the matter today, i.e. 24 July 2019, and IFF was represented by its legal team consisting of Suhrith Parthasarthy, Arun Mohan and Surasika, with our Executive Director, Apar Gupta also being present in person.  


### What is at stake?

This case is extremely important because the Hon’ble High Court is considering a wide remit of issues, and not just Aadhaar and social media linking.  These include encryption, intermediary liability and use of automated tools to take down illegal content.  


The outcome of this litigation could lead to a change in the product design of major social media platforms because law enforcement agencies want the Hon’ble High Court to direct these companies to devise a mechanism to trace the originator of a message. In this regard, a specific proposal has been made by Dr. V. Kamakoti who is a Professor at IIT Madras to include the phone number of the originator of a message whenever a message is forwarded.   


In its written submission to the Hon’ble High Court, IFF has emphasized that any restrictions on the use of social media platforms must be proportionate and they should arise from a deliberative and consultative process that takes into account the concerns of all stakeholders. We have highlighted how changing the product design of social media platforms to include the phone number of the originator of the message would undermine the freedom of speech of internet users. Anonymity is an important part of freedom of speech because otherwise, individuals would be too reluctant to discuss controversial subjects in the public domain. The right to anonymous speech is especially important for whistleblowers, abuse survivors, activists and others belonging to marginalized groups who may face harassment if their identity was disclosed.   


### What happened at today’s hearing?

Today, senior legal counsels appearing for WhatsApp and Facebook made extensive arguments on the central point of traceability. On our part, we filed and placed a substantive response which addresses a broad range of issues which have arisen including concerns regarding digital surveillance, encryption and content takedowns. During oral arguments, based on submissions made by the lawyers for social media platforms, the Hon’ble High Court expressed the view that it may even examine the existing level of compliance and legal vacuum under the IT (Intermediary Guidelines) Rules.   


Prof. Kamakoti’s technical inputs which formed part of the Government’s common report have been directed to be filed by the Hon’ble High Court. This promises to be interesting and we will respond to it. The next date of hearing in this case is 21 and 22 August 2019.

Highlights

* **Background:** In response to IFF’s RTI query, MeitY has revealed that blocking of pornographic websites in India is the result of three court orders. Two of these court orders were passed by an Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate in Mumbai and the third order was passed by the Uttarakhand High Court.
* **No pro-active blocking of porn by ISPs:** We can reasonably infer from MeitY’s response that ISPs have not been directed by the government to proactively block porn websites, and they should not be doing so in the absence of a specific court order. Hence, legally there is little or no basis for proactive blocking.

## 

## The mystery behind the Porn Ban

In India, viewing sexually explicit material in private spaces is not illegal. Then why are porn websites being blocked? Many of our supporters have pinged us about this issue, so we got down to first diagnosing why this is happening before coming up with solutions, if any, that this may require.

First, let’s start with the basics. In India, there are three ways to block a website. First, a website may be blocked pursuant to a court order. Second, a website can be blocked pursuant to directions of the Central Government under Section 69A of the IT Act. This is usually done by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) and the Department of Telecommunication (DoT). However, the Central Government cannot directly block websites for merely hosting pornographic content because obscenity or morality is not a ground for blocking websites under Section 69A of the IT Act (remember the controversy surrounding blocking of Savita Bhabi? Read more about it [here](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Govt-cant-ban-porn-websites-for-obscenity/articleshow/5558110.cms)). Finally, the DoT can also issue specific directions to Internet Service Providers (ISPs) under the [Unified Access License](http://dot.gov.in/sites/default/files/Unified%20Licence_0.pdf) to block websites in public interest (Clause 7.12) or to prevent transmission of obscene content (Clause 38.1).

To get to the bottom of this issue, we filed RTIs with both MeitY and DoT. Our RTI filed with DoT was transferred to MeitY, and the response from MeitY revealed that porn websites have been blocked in India pursuant to three court orders passed from 2016 to 2018.

## 

## Non-availability of court orders

Unfortunately, out of the three court orders cited by MeitY, only one order is publicly accessible and we have filed a first appeal with MeitY for a copy of the other two orders. Two of the three court orders were passed by the Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate of the Esplanade Court in Mumbai in 2016 and 2017. While we could not access copies of these two orders, the information available on the E-Courts website suggests that 500 websites were blocked in a single day based on a complaint by the cyber police department without providing any hearing to the owners of these websites.

&amp;#x200B;

[\(Screenshot from the E-Court website showing that the order passed by the Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate from Mumbai has not been uploaded by the court.\)](https://i.redd.it/28x9dksfjec31.png)

&amp;#x200B;

The third court order which is publicly accessible was passed by the Uttarakhand High Court in a suo moto writ petition (WP PIL No. 158/2018). In this case, the Uttarakhand High Court had directed blocking of pornographic websites mentioned in a notification by DoT dated 31.07.2015. However, DoT has clarified that out of the 857 websites mentioned in the notification, ISPs were only required to block those websites which hosted child pornography. Further, the final order dated 07.12.2018 in this writ petition disposed the matter after referring to an existing case in the Supreme Court, Kamlesh Vaswani v. Union of India (WP Civil No. 177/2013).

Interestingly, the RTI reply side-steps two other cases, Kamlesh Vaswani v. Union of India and In Re: Prajwala (SMW Crl No. 3/2015) which may have led to blocking of websites that feature child porn or videos of sexual violence. However, to the best of our knowledge, these cases have not led to any directions for blocking of pornography websites more generally.

## 

## ISPs should not block porn pro-actively

ISPs expands to internet service providers, *not internet service police.* The legal position is clear and they should desist from proactive filtering and blocking practices.

Moreover, the information received by us gives rise to a reasonable inference that the Government is **not** issuing directions to block porn unless it is child pornography. To us, this means that there are no existing directions for pro-active blocking of obscene content by ISPs, and they should not be doing so without a specific court orders directing them to block individual URLs. Finally, we recognize the concerning psychological impact of porn production and consumption but we do believe that when viewed privately, it falls within an individual’s right to free speech and privacy. This certainly does not include pornography which has minors present in it, or is created in the absence of consent. To make and view pornography belonging to both these classes is not only a crime, but a deep moral stain that results in long lasting physical and mental harm to the participants who are exploited for its production.

We acknowledge that the ethics of mainstream porn production, particularly the portrayal of women and other minorities, merit study and examination. There have been notable attempts by [Point of View](http://pointofview.org/blog/erotics-india/porn-panic-ban-a-conversation-about-sexual-expression-pornography-sexual-exploitation-consent), [Centre for Internet and Society](https://cis-india.org/raw/histories-of-the-internet/blogs/law-video-technology/xxx-files-initial-encounters-with-the-unknown) and [Centre for Communication Governance](https://ccgnludelhi.wordpress.com/2014/05/03/whats-problematic-with-porn-ban/) to promote a better understanding of online pornography through conferences and reports, and we hope there is greater conversation on the issue. At present, we maintain that pornography production requires greater diversity and strict enforcement to ensure absence of trafficking and labour protection. These are issues beyond the scope of our expertise and we look for leadership from feminist and sex workers’ rights organisations who are best suited to take the lead on this issue. We will listen and learn. At the same time, IFF will do what it does best, which is fight for internet freedom and the choice of individual internet users in India. This includes the private consumption of content that is deemed obscene under antiquated, colonial laws which should not find space in modern, progressive India.

It's an attack on our right to seek information on the powerful politicians and bureaucracy.,"Amendments have haunted the Right to Information (RTI) community ever since the RTI Act came into effect almost 14 years ago. This time, demands for progressive amendments has been used as a smokescreen by the establishment to usher in regressive changes.





Nevertheless, the sword of Damocles of regressive amendments has hung over the RTI with successive governments. Amendments have been proposed since 2006, just six months after the law was implemented and many times thereafter. The difference between previous government and this one is that every attempt to ammend RTI Act has been done with prior setting up of a standing committee and debates whereas this government just passed the bill without any discussion and setting up a committee.






In the form of the Right to Information (Amendment) Bill, 2019, they amended Sections 13, 16, and 27 of the RTI Act which carefully links, and thereby equates, the status of the Central Information Commissioners (CICs) with the Election Commissioners and the State Information Commissioners with the Chief Secretary in the States, so that they can (supposedly) function in an independent and effective manner. The deliberate dismantling of this architecture empowers the Central government to unilaterally decide the tenure, salary, allowances and other terms of service of Information Commissioners, both at the Centre and the States.







Some might ask why this hurry to make ammendments into the law? I think it is because the RTI helped with the cross-verification of the affidavits of powerful electoral candidates with official documents and certain Information Commissioners having ruled in favour of disclosure. RTI is a constant challenge to the misuse of power.






The RTI has been used to ask about village ration shop, the Reserve Bank of India, the Finance Ministry, on demonetisation, non-performing assets, the Rafale fighter aircraft deal, electoral bonds, unemployment figures, the appointment of the Central Vigilance Commissioner (CVC), Election Commissioners, and the (non)-appointment of the Information Commissioners themselves. The information related to decision-making at the highest level has in most cases eventually been accessed because of the independence and high status of the Information Commission. That is what the government has successfully amended.







The task of the Information Commission is therefore different but no less important than that of the Election Commission of India. The Commission which is vested by law with status, independence and authority, will now function like a department of the Central government, and be subject to the same hierarchy and demand for obeisance.






Apart from Section 13 which deals with the terms and conditions for the Central information Commission, in amending Section 16, the Central government will also control through rules, the terms and conditions of appointment of Commissioners in the States. This is an assault on the idea of federalism.







All the provisions related to appointment were used to be carefully examined by a parliamentary standing committee and then and only then the law was passed unanimously. It has been acknowledged that one of the most important structural constituents of any independent oversight institution, i.e. the CVC, the Chief Election Commission (CEC), the Lokpal, and the CIC is a basic guarantee of tenure. In the case of the Information Commissioners they are appointed for five years subject to the age limit of 65 years. Now, the central government is free to terminate their tenures if they wish to as CIC will function as just another department of Central government.",chs109,,false,/r/india/comments/chs109/latest_ammendment_to_rti_act_will_make_it_a/,Policy/Economy

1563386197,meenakshi1995,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cegbsk/how_is_india_addressing_climate_change/,0,2,,,How is India Addressing Climate Change?," There is a mixed record, in the past decade, of how India has tried to address the question of sustainability. Manmohan Singh's government, on the one hand, resisted the push to reduce emissions, while initiating the Clean Environment Cess in 2010. The Coal Cess was doubled in 2016 by the next government. This Cess, however was ultimately not very effective since the coal mining companies shifted the costs to the customers. The earnings from this scheme is supposed to go into the National Clean Energy and Environment Fund to be put toward developing clean and renewable energy technologies. However, since 2010, only 29% of the money collected was put into this fund, and much less into the intended projects. Renewable energy has increased by 47% under the current government. But coal based thermal energy has increased by 18% as well and is expected to be double by 2040. The  2017 Energizing India report by the NITI Aayog paints a bleak future. For instance, it says that by 2040, ""an additional 26 percent of our electricity would come from natural gas, which is also a fossil fuel."" Presently the strategy is to reduce emissions in relation to the GDP to stay within the Paris commitments.  But, this is not enough. The Paris commitment itself is insufficient in its goals.

https://i.redd.it/g582m08sm6d31.png

**Highlights**

* *Background:* Armed with publicly sourced complaints, IFF approached the Department of Telecommunications on the continuing net neutrality violations and BSNL on insertions of code injections. However, there has been pin drop silence in response.
* *Need for an action*:  The lack of a mechanism in place to provide redressal or cooperation from BSNL has led us to take a forward a three-pronged action approach.

### Background

Referring to our previous correspondences on 29.05.2019 with Ref. No. IFF/2019/112 ([Read here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1seyH554MRserRW7N_xyi3KUeYL6ywbrL/view)), and on 27.03.2019 with Ref. No. IFF/2019/107 ([Read here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wS1gUa0nl3YLM2Tlhjpej8l97cZan-yZ/view)), various complaints received by us have been documented in the representations indicating net neutrality violations through summaries of reports received along with an anonymised document of the various complaints of violations. In addition, our representation to BSNL with Ref. No. IFF/2019/110 has also specifically disclosed the occurrences of code injections inserted into non-https websites ([Read here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1q7aFOmqCOzvRaoifMheTOE16AdRTmI-b)). To combat atrophy, we have have deployed a combination three step move.

### Three-Pronged move to get a response

*Step One: RTI with BSNL*

Having provided various crowd sourced complaints of such browser/code injections against BSNL along with our representation, we received no response. As a result, we filed an RTI with Ref. No. BSNLD/R/2019/50935 has also been filed with BSNL for information on its use of code injections. We have requested for copies of action taken to our complaint and any other complaints it has received and reasons if there has been no action taken as well.

*Step Two: RTI and Complaint to the Department of Telecommunications*

In addition to our previous representations, we have once again written to the DOT once again, firstly, providing clarity on how code injections are a violation of  the Unified Licenses that govern ISPs and secondly, on its lack of response and need for action ([Read here for more](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g0BFsoN-E1ptHxzMLCa7Qk5Z5Knve8F7/view?usp=sharing)). Additionally, an RTI with Ref. No. DOTEL/R/2019/50637 has also been filed with the DOT on action taken in response to our complaints as well others on net neutrality violations.

*Step Three: Report to Cert-IN*

As a finishing touch, we have filed an Incident Report with Cert-In on the various instances of code injections we have received and also identified by attaching it as evidence. Many of these code injections have been termed to be malicious.  To clarify the issue, we have provided a letter providing the reason for our complaint ([Read here for more](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11FXCBEPN7c8orj5O6B8uMHDQUak3k7Tp/view?usp=sharing)).

As we wait for the responses from these various bodies, IFF will continue to document any and all net neutrality violations users might face through our online reporting tool.

**Please do report any violations you come across at** [**https://savetheinternet.in/report/**](https://savetheinternet.in/report/)**.**

Today i have got a ""fun"" experience.  [https://www.professionalscouts.com/](https://www.professionalscouts.com/)

Just registered in many websites to find a work... and then i got this phone call.

Scam or not, please give me your opinion. xD

&amp;#x200B;

First, a nice lady talking to me about super job opportunities.

Then i got to talk with a man, same super friendly, nice, perfect English... 

He is telling me he can arrange an interview for me with a package at 21.5lakhs a year.

Lets be honest, who proposes this kind of salary without even a meeting... nobody.

Obviously he is telling me that i will have a meeting soon to discuss it.

Again i got to talk to the first lady who just confirmed that the previous man was nice and then i got to talk to a third person.

&amp;#x200B;

At that point i am super doubtful : name dropping, big packages $$$, too friendly people, many interlocutors... 

Then come the funniest, someone is assisting me to read their websites and... finally it comes : 6000INR registration fee. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is it really common this kind of ""scam"" ?

I am not Indian and not much aware about this kind of stuff.... but it looks weird isn't it ?

The packet had ""electronics"" written in the memo and was properly sealed . But when she opened it it was not the product ordered.

She filed a complaint and for a refund to Amazon on the very day and here is the exact reply they gave after almost a week:

""I apologize for the unpleasant experience you've had in this regard. On checking, the issue was escalated by the concerned team as per the investigation results, correct product address. Hence, we'll not be able to provide refund/replacement for this order. was delivered in intact condition at your We appreciate your patience and understanding in this regard. We look forward to seeing you soon again.""

Nothing more can be done and it is probably a complete loss of the 5k rupees but I am making this post mainly to bring it to the notice of the people that stuff like this happens and to probably record a video while unboxing packages delivered from e shopping websites.

Edit: since I couldn't attach a pic as this was a text post, I posted the pic on my profile here of the reply Amazon sent.
 https://www.reddit.com/user/Horny_senpai/comments/capi8q/amazons_reply/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

Further she had called the customer service and filed another complain prior to receiving this email from them.

Update:  She got a call from Amazon India again (as a response to email sent to jeff bezos) and they said they are reinvestigating the matter.

I am a student and thus I dont have much money. All I get is 3000 rupees as pocket money per month from my dad for all my college related expenses. I opened a zero Balance account in SBI in 2015. Two years back Modi govt and SBI decided u have to have minimum 3000 rupees average balance every month. Now this quite a large amount of money to maintain for an unemployed student like me. Even if you try to maintain 3000 rupees they keep on deducting this and that as ""charges"" And your balance would eventually become less than 3000 rupees and you would get penalised for having a balance less than 3000 rupees and downward spiral would begin. Even back in 2017 and 2018 when my family was going through financial crisis and my cousin would send money from usa to support my education, I would instantly  lose 100 rupees as soon as the money entered my account because SBI deducted ""charges"" Of around 10-30 rupees and that means I have to withdraw one 100 rupees note less. 100 rupees down the drain every single time money entered my account. That way atleast SBI ate more than 2000 rupees of mine in 2 years. Now, I stopped keeping any balance in SBI and have recently opened a DBS account like a week back. Problem is, a friend owed me some money and he sent it to me on google pay. SBI was my primarily linked account because I had some server problems while linking my DBS account. The amount was 250. He sent me they money at 11am yesterday on Google Pay. Now, the money didnt even get credited on my account till midnight yesterday. This morning I woke up to these messages -https://imgur.com/gallery/bWSqaJV
250 rupees of mine gone the drain while I was sleeping. I feel like crying right now. Why do I live in such a country, this is why I hate online payments. Banks are looting normal people, paypal has limited options, cryptos are banned. What kind of country is this? This ain't no democracy, we are worse than china. Shame on these banks for looting poor students like us. Whats the solution? And how can I close this shitty SBI account? #BanSBI
Which bank has a zero balance bank account allow with no charges that would allow me to deposit money offline?

Tldr : SBI ate my 250 rupees as charges overnight. Image -https://imgur.com/gallery/bWSqaJV
This is organised and legalised loot initiated by the Govt of India. 250 rupees is a lot for poor people like me. Mallya's and Nirav Modi's take thousands of crores of loans and run away and this is how these ""banks"" LOOT common people in return.

EDIT : For people claiming these are just small fees and bank needs to do business. SBI collected 5000 crore rupees ONLY on Monthly Average Balance between 2017-2018

**Just make sure you should not pass NBFC 50-50 test otherwise you need to register at RBI

“Financial activity as principal business is when a company’s financial assets constitute more than 50 per cent of the total assets and income from financial assets constitute more than 50 per cent of the gross income. A company which fulfils both these criteria will be registered as NBFC by RBI.”

Fixed deposit are not treated as financial assets. But mutual funds are.**
 

https://reddit.com/r/IndiaInvestments/comments/c8n51z/_/esoxgst/?context=1



If there is a partnership concern or a LLP, with the sole business of investing &amp; trading in Equity / Bonds / Derivatives &amp; Mutual Funds from their own funds, do they have to register themselves as an NBFC ?

Is there a threshold ( Based on the capital ) for registering a corporate body as an NBFC ?

Similarly, if an HUF just has financial assets, are there any restrictions on their investments ?",c8yz11,,false,/r/india/comments/c8yz11/a_query_about_nbfcs_hufs_llps/,Business/Finance

Who is responsible for creating this pathetic situation? Nobody wants to be an entrepreneur today, even in cities like Bangalore, everyone wants to simply get a job. And this recent event should tell you why. But to make our country better, we can't allow this situation to continue. We need an atmosphere that allows startups to thrive. Otherwise, foreign companies like Starbucks and Walmart and Amazon will simply come here and eat our lunch.

This makes me think that is our system rigged in favor of foreign companies? Is all this nationalistic talk by our central govt. merely talk with zero substance? What do you think?",ck66p6,,false,/r/india/comments/ck66p6/who_is_responsible_for_the_pathetic_environment/,Business/Finance
1564596828,PanchamsKitchen,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ckc6tn/indian_domestic_remittance_retail_business/,0,1,,,Indian Domestic Remittance Retail Business,"Hello there!

I'm here to explain to you how the Indian domestic remittance business works in India. I had a retail shop in Mumbai, Where we used should charge a certain fee to transfer an X amount of money from people to their friends and families bank accounts.

**How does it work and what you need to have to start it?**

* An Outlet/Shop \[Owned Preferred\]\[Can be started with Rental outlets but can have issues at some point\]
* Principal amount to Invest in the balance/holding
* A Good Computer &amp; Mobile
* A Stable Internet Broadband connection

**Now let's talk about providers**

* There are banking kiosks like SBI, Bank of Baroda, Bank of India and Andhra Bank (These offer you Money remittance, Jan Dhan account opening, Passbook updates, and some other features. When I opted to get a license for it, the primary points where that the property was to be owned by the applicant and no other kiosk of the same bank should be available in a radius of 1KM. The Commission or the payout was issue to us in a month-end calculation basis)
* White-Label Dealers (Vendors Like Eko India, Payworld, Oxygen and many more. They have api integration with Banks like Yes Bank &amp; RBL &amp; SBI and few others for remittance and other services like BBPS for recharge/bill payments and connections to TravelYatri, IRCTC and some others for RAIL/BUS/Air ticket booking service. Commissions are adjusted instantly keeping the transaction seamless for you)

**How to maintain the balance**

* RTGS/IMPS/NEFT/Machine Deposit/Cash Deposit (You as a retailer can deal directly with the company by depositing your cash to the companies account via the listed method) (Removes the distributors commission for you giving you more commission but time consuming or liability, as you would need to either go your self to the bank at the end of the day with your money or trust someone with your money to deposit it for you)
* Having a distributor (These companies have local distributors who collect the cash from your outlet and deposit to the companies account daily morning before the bank closes. But they will charge you an x% for this service. The issue here is that the guys collect the money from the whole market, Go to the bank and deposit the money. They get the money transferred by the company into their account and then they individually allocate the balance to the retailers can take some time, so better keep some amount in balance to start the day with)

**Talking about the commission and the charges a retailer can take and the profit**

Generally, people come with thousands of money to transfer to their friends and family. Your target audience would be generally the working labors or a person who is in a hurry and has no time to visit the bank

**How does it work**

Labor walks down to your outlet with 25,000/- RS to transfer to his mother.

&amp;#x200B;

|Slab|Charge to take from customer|
|:-|:-|
|1/- -&gt; 5000/-|15Rs per thousand up to  5k|
|5001/- to 10,000/-|100/- Rs Fixed|
|10,001/- to 15,000/-|150/- RS Fixed|
|15,001/- to 20,000|200/- Rs Fixed|
|20,001/- to 25,000|250/- Rs Fixed|

So here I would take 250 Rs from him, Keeping my deal with the company in mind, I will have to pay the company 50Rs per 10k as a service charge, so the total would be 125/- profit and payment charge to the company. Companies can take up to 50%-60% of the service charge which you are taking from the customer. Plus area wise it also depends on how the market has been set by the other retailers.

**Now talking about the risk**

* The Indian banking system can suck sometimes. So if there is a heavy load on the servers, So if the money just gets stuck due to API failure, It can take up to 7-21 days for the money to be brought back to you.
* No Free account checking method - People tend to give wrong account numbers while hearing the numbers from their families on the phone and if you transfer the money and if its a valid account number of some other person. It will be credited to his/her account. (IMPS Enabled banks do allow a checking feature, where you can send a demo deposit of 1rs + Service charge to the account holder and gain the bank info, generally works but can fail at times) (NEFT transfers like Gramin bank, Shakah's are totally at your own risk, If it's valid it will go without any checks)
* Dealing with someone else's money, Above two scenarios can be very vital in this business as you are dealing with someone else's money. Double, triple check the account numbers with the customer before initiating the transfer. Money can be returned back  from other people's bank but requires a very tedious follow-up and documentation but till then your client won't be standing still, he will shout complain and maybe even fight for his own mistake

Profits are there! No Doubt but risks are also there! So here was a general idea of the Indian Domestic remittance business scenario. Written By me - Varun B. Account Handler - PanchamsKitchen.

1564032664,mrfreeze2000,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/chjila/a_reality_check_on_tax_rates/,130,66,,,A reality check on tax rates,"So many people I know have a very poor understanding of marginal tax rates. They think that if you fall in the 20% bracket, ALL your income is taxed at 20%

Here is a reality check. In these calculations, I'm assuming that you have maximized 80c savings of 1.5L

If you make 12L/year, you would pay 1.32L as tax. Your effective tax rate is just ~11%

If you make 20L/year, you would pay 3.82L. Your effective tax rate is just 19.1%

If you make 40L/year, you would pay 10L. Your effective tax rate is just 25.1%

You would have to make 60L/year to get close to 30% tax rate

If you're making 60L per year, you're well off in most of the world (barring outliers like San Francisco) and fabulously well off in India. Does 30% tax rate really hurt you that much?

I'm personally within this tax range and I don't mind paying the money. It's a standard practice across the world for independent contractors like me to keep 30% of any money made aside for taxes.

Keep this in mind. The last majority of people would cap out under 20% tax rate",chjila,,false,/r/india/comments/chjila/a_reality_check_on_tax_rates/,Business/Finance
1564072885,buddy_maga,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/chq5pm/i_finally_subscribed_to_paytm_first_membership/,12,23,,,"I finally subscribed to Paytm First membership, here are some experiences.","The offer seemed good, 1 year effective membership was for ₹650, after a ₹100 cashback. I was mainly enticed by the Uber offer, as I use it almost daily. Below are some of the offers I used.

&amp;#x200B;

* Add money to Paytm : You get ₹30 cashback for every ₹500 that you add. Not a killer deal, but an easy way to recover membership fees upto ₹360 in a year.

&amp;#x200B;

* Uber: So they had a flat ₹5 fee for Uber Pass. I thought that whatever Uber Pass I would buy, it would be avaible for ₹5, but when I used it, the ₹5 offer will give you a 1 month pass with only 10% discount on the Uber fare. So this was a disappointment, as the pass I was buying was ₹90 for a month with flat 20% discount.

&amp;#x200B;

* Man Company: One will get ₹200 off voucher every month. So I bought a pre-shave oil worth ₹499 for ₹299, with free shipping. The same product was for ₹399 on Amazon. Again this is an offer I might not use every month, but is useful.

&amp;#x200B;

* Zomato Gold: Even though I already was a Zomato gold member, this offer gets you 3 months more membership, which can extend your current membership.

&amp;#x200B;

That’s it for now. If you have any questions, ask away.

&amp;#x200B;

Btw, I’m in no way connected to Paytm or promoting them, last week I made a post asking for feedback here and since I got very few answers, I guess this post of mine would help people who are thinking of buying Paytm First.

1562439209,ancientshadow,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c9x5t6/seeking_a_laptop_suggestion/,12,11,,,Seeking a laptop suggestion.,"I'm sorry if these kind of posts are not allowed here. I'll take this down if it is the case. 

I've already posted on r/suggestalaptop but didn't get any response. 

I'm looking for a laptop for video editing and maybe some casual gaming. My budget is capped at ₹70000. Below is the form I filled on another subreddit.

Before I put the form in here, Laptops in India are hell lot of expensive. What costs around \~$800 in US is sold here at \~$1100 at least. On an average they cost about 40% higher here in India than the US counterpart.   
for instance: Apple MacBook Pro 15"" with 2.6 GHz i7 (9th gen) costs \~$3650 here.

So you get the point.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, AMDs are seen less in Indian market for ""who knows"" what reasons. There are only Ryzen 5 2500U, 3550H and a Ryzen 3. No Ryzen 7.

OK enough. I'm sorry.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the form:

&amp;#x200B;

\* \*\*Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications for the money? Pick or include any that apply.\*\*  

Not a fan of 2 in 1 form factor, good enough battery life maybe 3-4 hours of real world usage is enough. Best performance for  the money.  I don't want to rush for specs but performance.

&amp;#x200B;

\* \*\*How important is weight and thinness to you?\*\*  

4 on scale of 10

&amp;#x200B;

\* \*\*Which OS do you require? Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Linux.\*\* 

Linux preferably or Windows.

&amp;#x200B;

\* \*\*Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.\*\*   

anything bigger than 15""  

&amp;#x200B;

\* \*\*Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.\*\*  

Softwares:

Adobe Photoshop CS 6

DaVinci Resolve 16

&amp;#x200B;

Games:

Far Cry 5, COD WW, Forza Horizon 4 and similar games

&amp;#x200B;

\* \*\*If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?\*\*  

No specific games, Far Cry 5, COD WW, Forza Horizon 4 and similar games as I get my hands on them.

&amp;#x200B;

\* \*\*Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?\*\*   

Good Display because video and photo editing work and good enough build.

&amp;#x200B;

\* \*\*Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.\*\* 

Are there companies which offer global warranty or lets you transfer the warranty to other countries? Because I was thinking if I could ask a friend to buy one for me in US and then bring it over here.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, every model isn't available in India.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there any longevity difference between GTX 1660 and GTX 1060. Like which one of them would loose support or something in near future.  

&amp;#x200B;

1563208052,serpiconayak,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cdjlp0/a_neophyte_analysis_between_russian_chernobyl_and/,15,109,,,A neophyte analysis between Russian Chernobyl and Indian Bhopal disasters: TIL a chemical leak from a pesticide plant in India killed and injured more people than Chernobyl,"In the intervening night of 02 - 03.12.1984, around 40 tons of methyl isocyanate gas (MIC) accidentally leaked into the air from a pesticide plant managed by Union Carbide Corporation (now owned by Dow Chemicals), engulfing surrounding slum areas and suffocating tens and thousands. “Children, women, old men dying and dead on the roads. Carcasses of dogs, cats, chickens, goats, buffaloes, cows, birds lay everywhere,” read a New York Times article published a week after the incident.

**The direct cause of the Bhopal gas leak is attributed to the presence of water in a tank containing liquid methyl isocyanate (MIC)**. Liquid MIC is a chemical intermediate meant for the production of pesticide Sevin. Now, this chemical is stored in underground tanks under cool temperature and optimum pressure. Large amount of water enters tank no.610 on the night of December 2, 1984. This tank contained atleast 40 tonnes of MIC, more than the safety rules permitted. A run-away reaction begins which is speeded up by contaminants (iron residues from corroding pipelines). The mixing generates major increase in temp/pressure forcing the venting of toxic fumes.

Like Chernobyl, the Bhopal disaster was a man-made nightmare, with scientific &amp; investigative reports pointing to negligence, government oversight, managerial defects and state-level maladministration.

**Chernobyl/Bhopal**
Neither did scientists and Soviet leaders at Chernobyl nor did Indian authorities and officials of the multinational corporation anticipate such levels of catastrophe. The worst thing, though, in both the cases, was the risk management. Poor crisis response aggravated the situation and inflicted damages that could have been averted or at least mitigated.

**Parallels between Chernobyl and Bhopal**

Both occurred in the 1980s with an eighteen-month gap between them.

Both accidents unfolded at mid-night during night-shift sessions.

Although both resulted in explosions (A nuclear reactor detonates in Europe while in South Asia, a large storage tank of chemicals blew out of its concrete chamber following an uncontrolled reaction with water), Chernobyl’s ‘immediate’ death toll was lower compared to Bhopal where thousands perished.

The two tragedies were blamed on ‘operator error’ and led to the arrest and prosecution of individuals.

The Chernobyl Atomic Energy Station and the Union Carbide India Limited (UCIL) pesticide plant were constructed in relatively backward regions. Soviet Ukraine was a largely agrarian economy. **Madhya Pradesh was one of the least developed areas in India at the time. The state launched incentive schemes to attract factories and companies. Rapid industrialization invited large group of people, workers and migrants looking for jobs; many settled close to the factory. **During 1983-1984, the local government approved sanctions to let residents stay in these localities.

HOT (Human, Organisational and Technological) analysis reveals that administrative and managerial weaknesses contributed significantly to both accidents. In the case of Chernobyl, experiments similar to the routine maintenance test which led to the nuclear meltdown had been carried out before. The technical factors that caused the toxic leak at Bhopal had been identified previously but never fixed. In 1981, three years before the debacle, seepage of phosgene gas (component of methyl isocyanate) killed one of three employees assigned to shut it down. It was understood the person took off his gas mask in a contaminated area. At least 4 more leaks were recorded until 1982. **Safety lapses and minor mishaps were common occurrences at the Union Carbide factory.**

Workers broke safety rules because of organisational pressures. The need to generate electricity and meet the demands at Chernobyl pushed employees to skip regulations. Commercial pressure dictated events at Bhopal as the company cut back on safety provisions and maintenance practices as profit margins plunged.

Fundamental design flaws existed in both the plants, such as the ‘jumper line’ in the pipework at Bhopal that led to the entry of water to the MIC storage tank, and the positive void coefficient at Chernobyl RBMK reactors which led to a positive power coefficient (sudden power surge) at low power outputs. 

Operators had access, and were allowed, to disable key safety equipment, contributing to the accidents. While there was considerable component failure at Bhopal (the failure of the pressure valve of tank no.610), there was no apparent component failure at all at Chernobyl. Around 26 November 1984 (a week before the catastrophe), a Union Carbide employee tried to move 42 tonnes of liquid MIC from one of the three storage tanks to the processing unit. Though nitrogen was sent in to enable the transfer, tank no. 610 failed to get pressurized. This was a sign of leak.

Both accidents were exacerbated by managerial failure, information dearth and system related errors. The refrigeration unit meant to keep liquid MIC cool under 10-15°C was **shut down**. The vent gas scrubber, installed to neutralise the poisonous gas in case of a leak, was put in **passive mode**. A pipe leading to the flare tower, capable of burning remaining gases going from the vent gas scrubber, was **disconnected.** The alarm siren was **switched off** immediately after starting it and only restarted once the leak became severe.

Poor perception of severity of risk compounded workers’ problems. In 1985, one year after the incident, many of the workers were interviewed. According to a Times report, almost all the workers said they knew methyl isocyanate (MIC) was dangerous and some said they knew it could be fatal, but a dozen workers said they underestimated its toxicity. No one said they knew it could kill many people quickly.

Both accidents resulted in extreme, life-threatening health problems. Victims of Chernobyl suffered from nuclear exposure of varying degree from mild maladies to ionising radiation. The effects on Bhopal gas victims were far-reaching and some, still unfolding - **blindness, cancer, birth defects, depleting fertility rates, respiratory disorders, intellectual disability, body deformities, environmental contaminants like lead, mercury in breast milk of nursing women, babies born with fused bones and holes in heart.** One survivor is quoted as saying, “Those who escaped with their lives are the unlucky ones – the lucky ones are those who died on that night.” 

The Bhopal factory lacked quality instrumentation. (The pressure indicator control and level indicator of the MIC tank and the temperature indicator alarm were faulty for a long time. The instructions in English were not comprehensible for the operators. The initial practice of employing degree holders and imparting 6-month training slowly caved-in. Some among the workers were high school graduates). The Chernobyl station, by contrast, was considered a fine specimen of the Soviet system’s flagship technology. The employees, who were highly-trained and well-paid by the country’s standards, felt confident that no major accident was possible and thus, did not hesitate to ignore instructions.

**The 1984 poisonous gas leak in central India, to this date, remains the world’s deadliest industrial disaster.** 3,787 deaths were confirmed by the state of Madhya Pradesh. In 2010, in a curative petition filed in the Supreme Court, the central government sought compensation for ‘5,295 deaths’. However, activists claim 25,000 people died so far as a direct result of the disaster and the continuous chemical trial left behind.

We will never know the true extent of Chernobyl’s damage and death toll. It's been 33 years and yet, the exact scale of human sacrifice and the number of displaced remains a secret and a much-debated topic. Around 600,000 liquidators (many among them affected) from around the Soviet Union were sent in to assist with the prolonged containment procedures. Between 1986 and 2000, a total of 350,000 people were displaced with the exponential extension of the exclusion zone. It is said that deaths range anywhere between 4,000 to 93,000 over the years. A Belarusian study estimates total cancer deaths at 115,000, in contrast to the World Health Organisation’s tally of 9,000. **The Soviet Union’s official death toll is listed as 31.**

- Who am I?

I am M 18, A pubg player who used to play pubg for like 4 hours a day from season 1 ( A few days after the game was launched ). U may say I was addicted to pubg.

- Do I still play pubg?

Yes I still do play pubg. But not everyday. I play it very less than before. I only play if my friend msg me if we should play pubg at a particular time. If both of us are free at same time and willing to play then we play else no one plays ( or plays for like 10 mins )

- How did I reduce my time spent on pubg?

1. Glitch and bugs like 1 tap glitch and car glitch and lag in general made me feel that I should not play

2. My friends also felt the same. I used to play most games with my friends because I felt playing with random wasn't as much fun. So we all started to play less


- Why do people commit suicide?

Firstly we are notified of serious incidents like suicide / murder but ""pubg"" should have also destroyed many relationships/ friendships

Personally I do not think that pubg alone can lead to such sad incidents.
The person had no one to speak freely with. No one would listen. Maybe peer pressure made him frustrated. Maybe parents instead of helping, taunted the child. Maybe the society made fun of the person. All the saturated anger/depression was the actual reason. Maybe the person thought that the way the escape everyday boring life was playing and playing pubg.

- Is playing online games to take our anger good?

Yes as well as no. You may feel good after you scream at usually random people but you may also feel more frustrated if they all are against you and u aren't so good in game. In such cases it is a very bad choice

- Have I faced similar situation and what did I do?

Yes even I play online games to take out my anger and sometimes get even more angry.
I just quit the game and start watching some anime I like ( sports anime works the best for me ). Going out for playing or short walks or talking with friends or playing with pets should be better options but many times we can't do it. People should find what works best for them and do it and relax


- Are parents responsible for such incidents?

I can't directly say if someone is responsible.
But parents should help the child. 


- My suggestions to parents:

1. Please don't bring the topic about how the current generation is addicted to phones and pubg and u were like �� x better. It irratates and makes all of us angry. Because ur generation has ruined every single thing. Most of us don't have land to play. Many are forced to compete for marks even when they aren't ready. Ur generation invented phone. School/College and tuition leave very less time to just chill and enjoy.
2. Talk to children like a friend
3. If you notice significant change then pls ask someone for help",calp5r,,false,/r/india/comments/calp5r/my_thoughts_regarding_pubg_addiction/,Science/Technology

Brands used the tagline that their product is recommended by either Indian Medical Association (IMA) or Indian Dental Association (IDA).

It has become quite an easy way for brands to gain credibility among their customer base. By paying only about 50 lakhs, you can get IMA's nod and use their logo on your product.

Main objectives of IMA includes, promotion and advancement of medical and all related sciences, improving public health and medical education in India, and maintaining the honour and dignity of the medical profession.

**According to IMA sources, the amount received are used to conduct scientific activities, seminars and conferences. But what about ethics?**

Particularly how will Asia' urban systems be challenges by the movement of the next two billion Asians moving into cities (by 2030), and what the role of entrepreneurs and innovators will be as THE force to deliver the solutions required for sustainability in local environments, economies, and communities.

So, while the news surrounding Chennai's water shortage are now top of mind, and in keeping in mind there are dozens of other cities in India that are under similar threat, earlier this year I met with an amazing entrepreneur named Dhrav Khanna of Delhi based Triton Foodworks and interviewed him about his work.

It was an amazing discussion, similar to those I have had in Bangkok, Singapore, and Hong Kong, and while I was impressed by his systems, and saw similar challenges in business model, the one thing I really appreciated was in his approach to measuring how much water his systems saved again traditional farming.

The interview is around 20 minutes, so it is not short, but if you are an Indian looking for examples of individuals who are solving local problems using local innovation, this is a great interview and I hope you will share this with your networks.

1562092922,rohanpaul,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c8d03b/automation_in_our_society/,7,11,,,Automation In Our Society,"
One word has become synonymous with the current economy and job market, that's automation. Automation has been happening all around us for years, but the pace of it has increased substantially in recent times. We are staring at highly automated work environments where the need for people has become inefficient, automation has crept up slowly across industries and has become a major threat to future economies of countries. The problem is, that there hasn't been a concrete solution, no one seems to be agreeing on what could be the solution to this. 


Automation, in manufacturing industry has been constantly increasing, the coveted assembly line model by Henry Ford that streamlined the manufacturing process by making it efficient has in these modern times been a reason for automation to take over jobs. A decade or two ago you could see people working in assembly line, but now if you go to any manufacturing plant there is a high chance that you'll be seeing people only doing quality inspection on the assembly lines instead of doing any assembly, that's because all of it is being done by Robots that have gotten so efficient and cost effective in the long run that there is no reason to have people assembling it. 


Look at the IT sector for an example a decade ago when you dialled a customer support of a company there would be people picking up your phone and addressing you concern or complaints but now when you call customer support of a company, it's a jumbled mess of pre recorded options that you press, if you are lucky and have pressed the right options for a couple of times you might get lucky and actually have a person who might address your problem. Now think about both of these examples, the expertise required for assembling has been replaced by inspection of assembled stuff, which requires much less technical knowledge and experience. Same goes for the IT sector, now a couple of hundred of people can handle a country's customer support because of pre recorded options. This has obviously helped in increasing productivity in both industries and has made it easier and efficient process.


There have been people who have dismissed the buzz words of AI (Artificial Intelligence) and ML (Machine Learning), but software tools powered by AI and ML have been able to make a dent in management industry as well. For some time automation has only affected the workers or the labour intensive tasks, but AI powered software has made many management position redundant. In the service industry, you can already see bigger retailers, either going online or having less and less number of people employed in their stores, with the high penetration of internet, now payments have become increasingly cashless and you can see stores with self checkout counters in the west. You shouldnt be surprised if in the future you enter a mall early morning to get your groceries and you end up being the only person in the whole mall, since every task now has been automated. 


The major industry that is yet to be affected by this onslaught of automation has been driving, the goods carriers, the taxi drivers and truck drivers, the delivery guy who delivers your Amazon orders or the Swiggy guy who delivers you your food. There is a big chance that over the decade you might see all of them disappear, with self driving cars and trucks, drone delivery for goods becoming a reality, the industry will move quickly and make all of these automated. Atleast, now you can take that extra nap you need in your self driving car when you head out to work or eat your breakfast in it. 


Imagining all of this, must give people a sense of comfort, on how the future will be becoming more convenient, but the fact is that it would come at cost of hundreds of thousands of jobs. While, it is true that newer jobs will be created, there is no doubt that it will never be as many as automation will be replacing. There have been solutions to these suggested such as robot tax which is taxing a company more for more automation, or solutions such as Universal Basic Income which addresses the post automation world where jobs are less and people need to be subsidised for living. While not working does seem like an absurd option, maybe it actually isn't, hobbies can become lifestyle choices, more people can go into sports, with the space exploration in the horizon maybe we can go back to exploration, while this will obviously guarantee that capitalism will make the balance of society uneven where we will have the ultra rich that will have majority of the wealth distributed among a single percent of the population, it will be the job of the future governments, economists and leaders to address these problems.

Note: I made a post about content writing and got a bit of PMs regarding samples, so I just made a Reddit post about it. I'd appreciate your advice and suggestions.

NASA literally tweeted that how our Chandrayaan-2 will help them when they will step on moon again and Indians being Indians said they were ""flexing"" on us and asked them to use ""Burnol"". Seriously!? Space exploration is about cooperation and the greater good of mankind and not about patriotism. If all we do is pissing contest then we will make no progress at all. Our ego will be our downfall. And then there is Missing Mangal movie which will add fuel to this fire by making the whole movie about Patriotism and nothing about Space exploration.

I was initially planning to build a simple android fitness app that acts as a personal trainer for ppl to work out at home who dont have time to go to the gym but it was rejected coz such apps already exist. 

I need help searching for good innovative project ideas. Just asking in general do u think there is something u need which can assist u in daily life?

We have been ecstatic. Then got here the surprise of the beginning package deal which become barely touching three lakhs a year. good enough, we swallowed that after professors and senior college students advised us that L&amp;T turned into a tremendous location to start your career. best. This turned into compared to five+ for numerous other agencies. even as at this point in your profession, you need the enterprise extra than the employer desires you, it ought to be said that people, specially college students, will evaluate salaries. this is the starting point that produces disgruntled personnel. money, while no longer the only component, is essential.

next got here the recession. Mid manner through the 7th semester we get a letter from L&amp;T stating that they won't be able to recruit all and sundry and that we must start searching out trade opportunities. that is almost a 12 months after the original offer, by means of which era different huge corporates have ended their campus recruitment drives and we are left excessive and dry with out a assured employment. good enough. Making the first-rate of the situation, I searched difficult and observed jobs at 3 distinction organizations. A month into the activity, i am getting a call from L&amp;T pointing out that I can be offered a task the subsequent month. good enough. Being naive and now not too happy with my present job, i decided to take the provide. So i be a part of, along with all and sundry else who became initially recruited. superb news thus far.

Then comes working at Larsen and Toubro. i used to be assigned to their office in Gujarat. I need to point out that every single Maharashtrian with a hindu sounding call become assigned a few or the alternative branch in Powai, Mumbai. adequate, no complaints from me.

Now the shitty component. i ended up at a branch rife with ass licking and people bent on getting promotions via doing regardless of the boss requested for. I wasn't prepared to do that in general due to morals. sadly, i had neither know-how nor age on my side which brought about some needless confrontations with the control.

Now L&amp;T have this control Trainee software in which they placed all of the graduate recruits thru a series of checks and interviews to decide whom to place at the MT program. In my department of two hundred unusual personnel, we were 17 gets (Graduate Engineer Trainees). Of the 17, seven made it past the first written check spherical. Of the six who got through, 5 left the organisation within  years. most effective one stays. This illustrated one element to me:  the alarmingly high attrition rates.

general paintings
======

Now, approximately work. Accusations were flying thick and rapid right from the begin approximately how regionalism and favouritism have been rampant. Examples were mentioned. How a great deal fact there has been in those accusations, i can't say. What i did study changed into a continual lifestyle of ass licking. The boss is constantly proper. The boss controls your performance appraisal. The boss have to be worshipped. I did now not join this school of idea and that i made my perspectives clean. I challenged my boss' views brazenly however with courtesy. He did not take kindly to it. I simplest found this later.

about work, L&amp;T is basically a big contractor taking tech from overseas and simply installing it in india. there is often little expertise that they virtually make a contribution in spite of what the advertisements let you know. This became authentic in my branch. Others, i cannot touch upon. I saw equipment contracts being assigned based on favouritism and pressures from top control. L&amp;T has severa internal companies manufacturing special portions of equipment. The stress turned into regularly to award contracts to those humans instead of better excellent and cheaper options from outside. This disturbed me greatly and created problems later while equipment was hooked up and discovered faulty or simply badly designed.

Time pressures
===========

the entirety needed to be done earlier of shriveled cut-off dates even supposing this supposed storing sensitive device in the open on the mercy of the elements. no matter that the person that agreed to the cut-off dates had no real concept how long something would take to manufacture. This lead to gadget being dispatched in portions which have been often now not labelled and which have been tough to reassemble later.

protection
=====

This existed as a token individual claiming to be a safety officer on a construction website. The fact become that he was simply there to assert compliance with a few global standards. He often ended up being powerless to do anything approximately blatant protection violations on a construction site. to name some, daily wage labourers were observed operating with no fire safety gadget whilst welding and regularly breathing in risky fumes. safety harnesses were regularly tattered and antique. thoughts you, that is from a enterprise bidding for worldwide contracts and that i don't mean just in Nepal and Bangladesh.

Timings
======

in case you work at one of larsen &amp; toubro's production web sites, your existence is fucked. i am now not announcing this lightly. you work longer hours in the heat of the sun and are paid a pittance as a ""website online allowance"". centers for lodging could be horrible initially and could simplest enhance must personnel protest. Then too, upgrades will be grudgingly made. The customers are infinitely greater critical than the employees. We had been made to arrive at work at 0830 and go away at 1930. that is eleven hours, six days every week. personnel at the office in Gujarat were given trade saturdays off. We had been no longer afforded this luxury because you realize, you're our bitch. No pastime centers despite being made to live in the middle of nowhere. No gym, no perks in lieu of a more inconvenient life, nothing. The reality that had been had been given a ""website allowance"" become comparable to asking a beggar to be glad with the 10 rupee be aware you have exceeded him. Taking sundays off become frowned upon. I used the religious excuse which no one in india will dare question to keep away from going to paintings on weekends.

performance value determinations
===================

based totally on a ordinary distribution. i am not joking. every branch has to abide by using this. This led to humans operating their asses off at a production website being instructed that their paintings became under par because a person had to be in that class even as humans chilling within the workplace making electricity point presentations had been informed that their work became exquisite. extra frequently than not, the pinnacle performers were determined based totally on regionalism. In a department headed via a bong, expect to see bongs as pinnacle performers.

employee pleasure
==================

Seventeen receives joined the agency with me. i used to be variety 14 to depart. After me, one greater character left. the 2 that remain are nonetheless there. each unmarried one of my colleagues at my creation website have been desperately attempting to find trade jobs. add to this the truth that receives are treated like entitled children even as humans with greater experience becoming a member of the employer from out of doors are dealt with like shit. this is no exaggeration. i have seen it first hand. Ask round your self if you don't believe me. there has been a Gallup survey that changed into carried out 12 months, the consequences of which were in no way made recognized to the employees. you can wager at the reasons.

pointless and ineffective HR Practices
==============================

once more, to say compliance with international practices and to periodically appease personnel, obligatory HR associated publications might be compelled down our throats each yr. there has been no preference given to personnel. There did exist a machine in which you may choose what sort of education you wanted to obtain ranging from technical to soft skills. notwithstanding severa requests, control simply became me down claiming that it changed into a waste of time. yes, those people run the company and then surprise why human beings depart. Then there may be the difficulty of bonds. sure, whenever the company invests more than a unmarried rupee in you, you are made to sign a bond. I had a  yr bond initially. Now, from what i pay attention, human beings are being sent to IIM ahmedabad for some kind of government schooling programs. simply how long the bond duration is on that, i'm wondering.

Racism
======

yes, it occurred and it happened within the open. people had been unaware of it. A colleague and that i were probably the handiest ones that noticed. The indian engineers had been housed in an often muddy floored workplace. It changed into air conditioned so that become true. each person with white skin were given a non-public office with their personal internet connection and coloration printer. The indians did no longer deserve either easy toilets or a color printer or internet get admission to. yes, this genuinely passed off. Caucasian folks who have been technician level however representing the western manufacturers of vital device got treatment in shape for kings. each person indian looking, irrespective of which business enterprise they represented was housed with the rest of the scum.

The end
=======

After seeing severa colleagues depart in frustration, i too threw inside the towel. i used to be asked publicly whether or not i'd like to go back. I answered no and become met with a bowled over silence from all round me.

Conclusions
==========

people leave horrific managers, now not agencies, it is said. inside the case of Larsen &amp; Toubro, it is often a poisonous aggregate of the 2 where your manager is powerless to restoration the situation. The senior management is ageing and often gradual to react to HR related troubles. The passive nature of the HR setup is frequently in part liable for this hassle. employees are often left with recourse or answers to their problems. The desired manner out is to leave. you could evaluate the attrition charges for L&amp;T (no longer infotech) and the average IT agency and each will be similar. those numbers are because of a systemic problem that needs to be addressed ASAP.


**TL;DR** in case you're studying to grow to be an engineer, think two times earlier than becoming a member of Larsen &amp; Toubro. this is my honest recommendation. on the other hand, this will be the scenario in maximum indian engineering / contracting agencies.",cibkzr,,false,/r/india/comments/cibkzr/a_word_of_caution_to_freshers_my_experience_with/,Science/Technology

As above mentioned I need to build atleast a 5 member coding team to make an online portal. All to be done from scratch.

How should I go about hiring people ? Ads don't work. I have tried them.

My original charger broke so I went to the Asus dealer and he gave me a 2-pin adapter, saying it's safe. That was 30 days ago. My motherboard and hard disk coincidentally needed to be replaced after I used the charger for 3 or 4 times. I don't know if the process was gradual or the adapter caused it. I've asked like 3-4 people who repair laptops, all of them said there shouldn't be a problem. But I'm doubting them now.

I would like to discuss it with people who have reasonable lab experience in such procedures. If you are well versed with material analysis , your knowledge will be of great help and if you're looking for an opportunity to do something new with the skills you have , this is it ! 

I have a good understanding of how the market works , what the supply/demand rhetoric is , I have had reasonable success in the past in implementing ideas but this project is larger than anything I've done before. Through this company I want to improve the living conditions and standards of everyone in general. So , I want a partner(s) who can tell me about the requirements and necessities of running a analytical laboratory.

As the main driving force for me is , as long as I can test for the purity of water , food , etc I can determine why these essentials are contaminated and how to improve the quality or find less harmful alternatives. The first step to solving a problem is acknowledging there is a problem to start with. The vegetables and fruits we eat are laden with heavy metals , ripening agents , excess fertilizers , pesticides which we unknowingly consume on a daily basis. It is a very big problem throughout india , but it's a hidden problem because theres no concrete way to factually check for contaminants.

I didn't believed him, took my laptop back and gave him 3200rs for installing the ram and then i formatted the hard disk and after that it started working normally (maybe when it hit bad sectors then i got the black screen error as hard disk(3F0) Boot device not found) but after 3 days the same problem occurred, and this time i decided to buy the ssd and replace the hard disk. So i bought Samsung evo 860 and tried to replace but laptop didn't detected the ssd. This time i went to different shopkeeper and gave it to him and he told me the hard disk connector was damaged and i have to change that and after 2 days he bought the connector and this time he told me that it got short-circuit and there is some other issue. He took 2 week to give me the update and gave me the update that motherboard is having some issues and now i have to replace whole motherboard.

I want some career advice but I have no friends in the relevant fields to ask. I graduated in electrical engineering and learnt absolutely nothing and have no skills to get me a job in electrical field. So I turned to IT and worked there for 1 year and god it was shit. I decided I will never get into IT and get into some product based companies. The issue is I have no education in CS. I quit last year and decided to give GATE-2019 in CS/IT paper to make my way into the computer science fields as I feel I am good at coding and stuff. I got AIR of 5300 in the GATE exam and am trying again for next year. (I'll continue with masters in whichever college I get if I don't get a good score this year too).

So now I'm completely clueless as for what my future plans are. Other than attempting GATE and doing masters. What am I supposed to do next? I feel like I don't have any practical skills to make myself employable. I can write programs in C and solve intermediate level coding problems on Hackerrank or similar coding sites. But I doubt that is enough to get me a job. I am thinking of learning some online courses and learn something other than C. But what should I learn? What do I have to learn to make myself employable? I understand that what I should start learning depends on which job I want to get into. But I can't decide and have no one to consult. I hear some buzzwords like data science and machine learning on the news and online but I don't know if that is right for me.

I thought of getting into the following fields: ML, Data science, Web development, Android development.

But again I have not the slightest idea of any of those. As far as I understand, ML and Data science requires more math and I can't say I'm good at math. With web development, I'm afraid it is not like traditional coding and wonder if it has good job opportunities here in India.

If you know any other good field with good opportunities in India please suggest.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I know that I have a goal. Which is to get a good coding related job. But I don't know how to get to that goal. Nor which technology I should get into. So please help me decide.",ccdt2p,,false,/r/india/comments/ccdt2p/need_some_career_advice_or_advice_for_future_plans/,Science/Technology

A real estate broker was showing me some properties, and had finalized on one.. Later tells me that the difference in registered value vs actual sale value can be paid via - wait for it - bitcoin!!
And he said that you could buy it while in the Gelf (he assumed I worked there cuz of my dad) - and hence no restrictions of buying from India or withdrawing cash.

I checked with the seller later, and said he wants cash and the broker is getting him cash - so looks like this guy is not just a real estate broker now, but a bitcoin broker too.

Noped the fuck out of it, no way I'm converting my white money into black for these guys.

Post part 1, you should have acquired three main skills

* You must know one programming language with medium-to-expert proficiency
* You must have a rough idea of what Object Oriented Programming languages is and what Object Oriented Design is. Its an added bonus if you have worked with an OOP language like Java / C++
* You must have built something small, learned how to debug / write basic test cases.

A great addition that /u/esotericaniket added was the ability to read code. As they advised, you could pickup Github repos that are at the same skill level as you and start reading code. If that code makes sense to you, you've made great progress. If it doesn't, adapt, improvise, overcome.

This post will target someone who is in the second year of engineering.  Now, if you followed the first post closely, you would have a list of clubs in your college handy. There are two scenarios :

1. Your college does not have clubs.
2. Your college has average clubs
3. Your college has good clubs

I will elaborate on all three scenarios and help you take your learning forward. As usual, I am open to any addition / changes.

**Scenario 1 :** Your college does not have clubs

No issues, a lot of colleges do not have clubs. In this case, I'd recommend continuing your learning experience by building a little bigger thing or getting an industry internship.

**1.1 Build something people can use**

When it comes to building something, this isn't similar to how you built something in the previous post. Your focus here should be to solve a real world problem and something that attracts / helps at least 10 users. Say, you don't know what to do in the weekend. You can work with the Zomato API and make an app that will choose a random restaurant and recommend it to you. You can also add other APIs that will generate a list of things that you can do. This is just an example, but you see how you can find people using this kind of a thing? I hope you do.

You will have to spend sometime analyzing the problem around you first and how you can solve the problem.

So, the obvious question comes:

**1.1.1 How can I find a problem and how do I analyze a problem?**

Start small. Don't think about saving the world, think about saving your friends. Try to figure out a part in your life that can be automated or a small feature that might help make your life better. This doesn't have to be a disrupting solution. If you find such a problem/solution, good. If you don't, pickup an already solved problem and solve it your way. I will elaborate on this later. While thinking about the problem, do not think about code / technologies / solutions / effort. Just focus on the problem. No matter how big the problem is, we will see how to tackle it later.

**Finding a problem -&gt; Finding a solution -&gt; Designing a solution -&gt; Implementing -&gt; Testing is an iterative cycle.**

**1.1.1.1** **Solving a New Problem**

Here, I am assuming you have found a new problem. If you haven't, skip to the next section. Once you have a problem in hand, analyze if the problem really needs a solution or its okay. Take an example of a hostel where every floor has only 2 washrooms and availability becoming an issue is your problem. If you decide to solve this by building an application to mark washrooms as vacant or not / book the washroom, it might not be an ideal thing because its a headache to use. If you say you will add a device that will track occupancy of the washroom and automatically device a queue based system on first-come-first-serve basis based on request, it will again be an overkill as the person in need of the washroom might as well just go wait outside instead use your solution.

So, once you establish that your problem does require a solution, try to think about a solution. Again, at this point, don't think about HOW you will implement the solution. Don't think about the programming language, framework, etc. Just think of the solution. I will take the same example of having an application that will tell you a random thing to do in the weekend. Think about how one would go about this problem currently. The steps they'd take is probably something like :

1. Visit websites about restaurants, pubs, events, cinemas and theater.
2. Filter by date, nearness and other criteria
3. Book.

Your goal has to be automate 1 and 2 by building this app. Identify a few sources that have free to use APIs that help you do 1 and 2 and now you have the basic solution in mind.

**1.1.1.2** **Solving an existing problem**

Did you not find any problem that you could solve? No issues, it does happen. Now start taking a problem that is already solved. Make an app that's already there or solve a problem that is already solved, but all by yourself without referring the solution. A simple problem would be money management. You can make an application that will help you manage your money. There are 10 thousand apps that help you manage your money, so why should you do one? A simple answer is because you did not build the other 10 thousand apps, so this app will be YOURS truly.

**1.1.2 Solution Description**

You now have a problem at hand. Now think about the solution. Make a list that describes your solution and the features that your solution has, what will be the mode of access (Mobile App / Web App / Command Line Interface / API) and some thinking points that you want to note while implementing the solution. Be sure to document all of these if possible, maybe in very simple terms.

**1.1.3 Implementation**

**1.1.3.1 What will I use?**

Now, personally I have been a fan of learning by doing. So, I would suggest you spend a couple of hours in looking up what suits your need the best and what can be easily learned. Both these things are very important. For example, if I want to make a Money Management application, I can definitely start learning Java and build a native Android App. But is that what will be ideal? Is there a way I can expose this application to multiple platforms? Or make it platform independent? We will have to think of our users to come to this conclusion.

As an other example, if your idea is to track a Git repository and send a notification when there is an issue raised in that repo, an application might not be the best way. A telegram / Whatsapp / email bot might be ideal there. So, do your research

Also identify if you can use any APIs or existing service instead of re-inventing the wheel.

Document these.

**1.1.3.2 How do I begin?**

Now that you know what to use, the next question is how to begin. The way I would start is usually cloning the Hello World application of the the framework/language that I have chosen and use that as a starting point to write on top of. This MAY not be the right way, but it has worked for me.

Its totally okay to clone a project and make changes to it. But, if you want to not do this, the other way is to set everything up from scratch. I strongly recommend referring to the official documentation at some point in your coding life cycle. (The earlier, the better).

Whatever you do, remember to put it on Git(hub/lab). Have a Readme file that describes your idea and commit your changes regularly. If you don't know how git works, take some time to understand that. (Maybe thats an interesting topic to cover in the future?)

**Scenario 2 :** Your college has average clubs

Now, in this case you can either give up and follow the Scenario 1 route or do some analysis on why these clubs are average. Mostly (and this is ONLY from my experience), a lot of clubs have good ideas with busy/technically challenged mentors. I've seen good mentors have good ideas and still would want to do things the old way wasting a lot of time in documentation where they expect you to document the code even before you begin coding, instead of prototyping and then documenting. Both have their fair share of pros and cons, but I think today's generation would rather have a proof of concept than have gazillion documents which describe every small aspect of the idea.

If your professors or mentors aren't upto the mark, resistant to change and micromanage projects, I would sincerely advice you to not pursue this. Having said that, I would advice you to give it a try temporarily to see if you can change things. Set a deadline in your mind, say, 1 month. If you don't have anything proper to show in a month, quit and start your learning on your own.

**Scenario 3 :** Your college has good clubs

In this case, pick a good project. Preferably something that you can complete. A good set of projects to pick would be something that has already been started and you can see yourself completing it. The next best thing would be to work on a project that is still in the idea phase. 

When you pick a project, don't just pick it because it has a lot of buzz words. Think about the project, do your homework, check if there are existing projects that do the same thing and then validate how you are going to be better than the existing project. Basically, you will need to believe that the problem you are solving is worth solving and/or can be solved in a stipulated time. 

You spending time writing an application that will digitalize attendance in your college is much better than trying to write ML models to do some task that you don't believe in and have no idea about.

Stay in good touch with your guide. Meet them regularly, update them with your progress, your learning, roadblocks and deadlines. Your end goal should be to get an internship certificate and a letter of recommendation from your mentor.

Preferably, log the work you have done everyday and aim to do better than you did on the previous day. If possible, use Git to put your code online!

I am sorry for the delay in the post and for giving very less importance to Scenario 2 and 3. I will be taking any kind of questions in the comment box. I might be late in replying because I am currently busy with work. But I will definitely reply to you.

Also, if you feel you are stuck in a hellhole, are lost and have no way of coming out of this mess that is engineering and coding, please do DM me and we can schedule some time to have a chat! I will definitely try to help you out.

My next post will be about Internships in your 3rd year, how to get them, how to leverage your learning, how to choose good internships, face interviews, etc! A lot of writing might go into that, so I can't promise you a deadline. But I will try to keep it before the second week of August. :)

As usual, any modifications to my wall of text are welcome!

Firstly, incentives can be provided for electric vehicles or public transport and this curb the impact of the transportation sector. However, thought these suggestions have been made, there is no political will to carry them out. Secondly, households can be given electricity and slowly phasing out LPG   
(the current trend is to increase the usage of the latter). Thirdly, rainwater can be harvested and the rivers could be restored to their original flow so that they can bring back the wetlands and the natural ways of silt, nutrient and wildlife flow. All of these use technologies and can be implemented by the 11 year period the IPCC has stipulated before which any change must be made if we are to evade the adverse effects of climate change. So far, though the initiatives by the Delhi Metro to switch to solar power- or similar efforts by the Kochi airport-are a step in the right direction, such moves are few and far between. These models should be taken up by other agents as well.

In sum, development should be looked at through the lens of sensibility. The focus should be on restoring wilderness, cleaning, and reducing the use of fossil fuels etc at a stage where our infrastructure is still being built and when we still have the opportunity to sidestep the mistakes made by the West.

A news report published in October in The Economic Times said, “Start-ups witness 108% growth in funding in India in 2018.” The news report further mentioned that Artificial Intelligence was among those domains which witnessed the fastest adoption among industry sectors. **Currently, there are about 400 start-ups working on AI and machine learning domains. About $150 million dollars is invested in India’s AI sector by private players alone and the number has been growing since 2016**. Though there has been growth, India lags far behind countries like the US and China in terms of investment. With a copious pool of STEM talent and with a growing population of youngsters, India will be banking on AI for its economic growth and improvement in the quality of life of its citizens.

There are several start-ups that are based in cities such as Bengaluru, New Delhi, Mumbai and Hyderabad which work on artificial intelligence principles to serve consumers better. Their product range varies from multi-lingual chatbots to online shopping assistance and automated consumer data analysis

* **THE ROAD AHEAD**

The National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence which was put together by the government of India through NITI Aayog sets the roadmap on how to develop AI in the country. The report points out how AI will help the country grow, what are the strengths and what are the challenges on the way. The government has identified a few areas where it thinks AI will play a crucial role as far as India is concerned

 

Capital and qualified manpower are the two main pillars that are required for the establishment and growth of any sector. India is home to a large talent pool of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math graduates. Companies such as Google, Intel and Microsoft have been offering short term training programs to computer program developers which help them upskill in the area of AI programming. On the other hand AICTE, the government body which governs and regulates professional education in India, recently added AI, IoT, Machine Learning and few other subjects as mandatory subjects in its curriculum of B.Tech programs. Changes in curriculum and content are further expected in the days to come.

Investment towards AI from private players has been increasing in India ($44 million in 2016 to $77 million in 2017). The start-ups have been working towards developing various AI-based products and services. With conglomerates having a lion’s share in India’s market, there is huge scope for AI-based enterprise solutions in the country. The increasing demand for products and services can attract more investment towards R&amp;D in AI sector
