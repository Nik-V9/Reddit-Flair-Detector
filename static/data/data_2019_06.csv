I know r/gainit exists, and it has been really helpful for broad guidelines, but when it comes to diet planning, I find that a lot of the suggestions there are tailored to a western (and mostly NA perspective). Food pricing varies a lot from geography to geography, and a lot of the cheap suggestions on that sub aren't really cheap back here, especially in comparison to income levels. Add to it the fact that many of us are vegetarians too.

Hence trying to build out a list of food items, both bulking and clean; veg as well as non-veg. **Help me please people!!**

PS: A dirty secret that I've come across is ghee and coconut oil. Adding them to your Dal post cooking (I can't stand coconut oil though) helps you (at the cost of fats though).",bxhrjo,,false,/r/india/comments/bxhrjo/figuring_out_a_costeffective_indian_gainit_diet/,Food

As i was about to eat,  zomato' personnel contacted me and said that you had ordered twice so do you wish to receive the second order too to which i replied saying that i had ordered only once and had recieved it too...so he told me if you have any problem contact through email or chat support. So the second order was cancelled and now cancellation charges are levied.
Every time i call them, or use chat support or send them an email they keep telling their policy that if order is cancelled,cancellation charges can't be removed.
They didn't even cross check from burger king or check call records of their delivery boy as to whether i actually received it or not.
No acknowledgement is sent to me in respect of the order i paid for..only the cancelled order is shown in the order section of their app.
Also, Their delivery boy is lying..he gave me the order.. took the money but didn't update the order status..
So for one order i am basically asked to pay twice.

I have been a faithful customer and have ordered multiple times through zomato but still i am held accountable for this issue even though its not my fault.

Guys dont order from zomato app...customer support is terribly slow and awful and they take ages to resolve it..and then they say "" your issue is really old thus it can't be resolved or as per our company' policy we can't solve your issue"".",c365y9,,false,/r/india/comments/c365y9/zomato_rider_delivered_the_order_but_zomato_is/,Food

I did not know where else to post this, so I hope this is appropriate. I've never in my life tried Indian food until today. Where I work, at the cafeteria, I decided I would try some Indian food. I honestly do not know what I even got.. to my regret.. I just pointed at something random and they served me a plate of this chicken with some type of thickish orange sauce (some type of curry?). It was honestly the most delicious thing I have ever eaten. Anyways, there's an Indian restaurant near me and I plan on ordering food there tomorrow. What are your recommendations of what I should try next? I'm thinking of a chicken entree. 

Here are my options for that:

Now this, walking away because Mr Kohli is really woke that he doesn't need a decision.

Maybe I'm just really frustrated Rohit not making a 200 and Virat throwing away an easy hundred.

&amp;#x200B;

Im Brazilian, and always loved sports. I use to watch everything broadcasted on TV. But almost no one here knows nothing about cricket, I would say most part of Brazilian dont even know what cricket actually is, and just a few could understand the rules. Because of the current World Cup, for the first time I tried to understand how a cricket game goes on, and I really liked it. I think cricket is a funny game, and I liked the tension and strategy involving it.  Anyway, I dont imagined before that game's are so long, this is weird for Latin Americans, who basically follow just football. 

&amp;#x200B;

As India is famous to be one of the most passionate cricket countries, I started ask myself, how Indians enjoy a national team game on World Cup?

&amp;#x200B;

I mean, in Brazil, FIFA World Cup is a really massive moment. If national team plays on a morning or afternoon on our local time, almost all the schools and workplaces will not open on this period and basically everyone will be watching the game. Not everyone likes ""regular"" football, but almost everyone gets involved with football in World Cup. You can even hear people's reaction on the game from your window. By two hours, the whole country just stops to watch it, and I think this is normal on all other ""footballing"" nations.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I think stop a country by eight hours for a sports event is maybe not possible. I'm wrong? How the country lives a India game day on World Cup? Also, football fans use to watch almost every FIFA WC game, even the ones that Brazil doesnt play. How cricket fans live World Cup?

I have mentioned there that anybody can message me regarding fitness advice and I have got quite a good number of messages ,I have replied to all of them ,some of them were regarding diet,some about weight loss and some regarding general fitness. I have been lifting for about 3 years and have even done a competition around 2017(I will include pic as well if anybody wants to see). After reading,implementing and going through multiple phases I can say I have sound knowledge on fitness. I am thinking of making fitness related plans such as weight loss,general fitness etc. Now you must be thinking that there are lot of resources out there and why we should enlist in my programs ,yeah you are right but the information on the internet is quite overwhelming . You may see hundreds of exercises but won't get a proper plan which suits your body and goal. Yeah you can buy a program too from any fitness guy from US,UK etc but they charge like hundreds of dollars and have hundreds of clients. The thing is I have applied lot of knowledge in my own physique and have been through ulcer etc due to hostel food which helped in finding more about my body. So I will be taking 10-15 people at starting making custom plans for them and will be charging a nominal fee. The best thing about the program is even of that nominal fee you can pay 60-75% at beginning and remaining after 4 weeks if the program is of 12 weeks. I will be checking on everyone that takes the plan weekly checking their progress, measurements , prescribing any changes. So that's all.

You can comment down and ping me if you are interested. 
Do let me know if this is a great idea.",bxvrdp,,false,/r/india/comments/bxvrdp/fitness_programs_for_randians/,Sports

E-sports has undeniably risen and still rising up to huge popularity levels

Yet , in India we see people suggesting that gaming is bad and games should be banned and it feels like our government has no idea that a huge platform like e-sports exists. 

Seeing that people wanted PUBG banned for not acknowledging their mistake or bad parenting also makes it look like majority of India is against e-sports.

We’ve started a new podcast on cricket called 'On Cricket, Off Topic'. It’s about, well cricket, from the perspective of three Indian cricket fans who grew up watching a mediocre team become a cricket force to be reckoned with. 

We are reviewing and previewing the current world cup matches and also reminiscing about the 90s when we as kids first started watching cricket. 

I should also mention that our content is in Hinglish (a mix of Hindi and English). We currently have 7 episodes out there (we will be launching 2 per week going forward) and you can find us on iTunes, Stitcher, Spotify, Google Podcast and most other podcast directories.

1561270346,DeRoquentinize,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c4013r/a_gap_after_graduation/,12,26,,,A gap after graduation,"Hi r/india,
I've been here for a while now but this might be my first serious post. I'm living in Delhi for now and would be staying here for atleast a year. Now propelling towards the subject matter, I only just graduated in English and am currently as unemployed, despondent and clueless as any Indian graduate from Humanities is usually found. It kind of depresses me to realise the shitshow that awaits me; I'm not all hopeless nonetheless, just a bit worried seeing the haze that lies ahead.
Personally, I'd been wanting to drop a year and think things through but this, too, seems like a luxury now considering my tight family economy. I'm dropping a year nevertheless.
Now what I need you people to advise me on is the future prospects that I might tap on. My motive to remain in academia and get into JNU the next year but for now I'm willing to make some easy money (let it be parenthetically known that I have BPO in my mind). What other jobs do you all think I could apply for? I'm also interested in aesthetics and cinema. For instance, a job as a tour guide in a museum would suffice both my intellectual thirst and financial crisis; but that seems far-fetched. In three years of my graduation, I've read quite a bit of novels and watched a fair share of movies whence I receive whatever knowledge I have on world cinema. The issue lies in the fact that all my knowledge is theoretical which would barely assist me in practically making money which stands, atleast for now, as an imperative for me for I'm planning to get financially independent from my family or atleast take the least amount possible from my dad.
Further, I've got my eyes on pursuing a course in French language but all the places I know are way too costly for my pocket in Delhi, Alliance Francaise for example. Others that might be cheap and effective are ones that I don't know about. So people who happen to know about any such places could guide me please?
I feel I could also do some teaching but every place I apply to demand that Grammar be taught more than literature. Now people who are even minutely familiar with literature would know how difficult it gets to impart the tricky grammar rules to others. I hope this post gets me a few steps further from this standstill. Thanks.",c4013r,,false,/r/india/comments/c4013r/a_gap_after_graduation/,AskIndia

I literally waited for this Sunday to talk with you guys about this. The grand Times Soulmate page in the newspaper that comes every Sunday, one page blue and one page pink. Some Sundays I actually pick it up scan through it, find the funniest and laugh over them. Usually just petty stuff and inside jokes like ""Searching for Veg. Boy"" (can't remember the good stuff atm). Although it's probably nothing to laugh about. Don't hate just yet. 

So if you look at the differences between the pink section and the blue section, you definitely see it. A girl is almost always advertised to be and I quote:

*V. Fair, V. Bful, V. Cultured, unmarried, slim, 5.X/34 but looks young, XX+ lpa, highly qualified, well settled family* and the rest is work specifics and such.

For widowed women it's *40 but looks 30*. Or really specific *38 but looks 31*. And to think that there are just 4 lines out of which 2 are for contact info. And to think each word needs to justified in the most sickly way possible.

On the other hand for men it's just handsome at most and their work specifics. But their atrocity probably steps in when accepting only people in IAS or from the IITs. The pink advertisements do it too.

To think that someday we might be advertised in 4 scrawny lines that aren't even highlighted is... I don't have words for this one. 

So what do you Randians think?",c40j2e,,false,/r/india/comments/c40j2e/the_times_soulmate_a_sunday_lunch_discussion/,AskIndia

Back at the end of the 19th century, The Netherlands owned Dutch Guyana (now called Suriname), a small piece of land above Brazil that they traded with the English for the piece of land which they eventually created New York on (used to be New Amsterdam). They owned various plantations where slaves used to work. After they decided to abolish slavery, they needed new folks to work the land. 

From what I know, the Dutch struck a deal with the English to get Indian people to work in their colony. These people were told that they would come back rich after a few years of work so they could live like maharajas. A lot of people decided to take the chance, either because they were in a low caste or might have done something against the law in India. They were coming from either Calcutta (my mother’s ancestors) or Bihar (my father’s ancestors).

Does anybody know why they might have chosen to seek their faith in another country? What I know is that many Indians in Suriname decided to add “Singh” to their surname just because that sounds fancier or something. My grandfather tells that his father who came from India barely spoke about his life back there. Does anyone know more about this period and the people that left India? I’m very curious what my ancestors’ lives must have been back then. 

TLDR; great grand parents are from India. Moved to Surinam for work. Now living in the Netherlands. Would like to know more about India from before the move to Surinam.",c4334g,,false,/r/india/comments/c4334g/in_search_for_the_family_of_the_indian_migrants/,AskIndia

I'm a 33 year old Caucasian European and will be for the first time ever in India between 16 and 22 June, for work. I've been dreaming to visit India for years, so very excited to have the chance through work to visit your country!

I will have full Sunday 16 June (day + evening) free in **Hyderabad**, and I will have Friday 21st evening and Saturday 22nd full day free in **Pune**.

First of all, as mentioned, I'm Caucasian and rather light skinned, ginger hairstyle and freckles. I burn easily and I sweat already in a Europe's 25 degrees sunshine stroll. How much am I going to suffer in Hyderabad and Pune?

Second, I will need a local SIM card for data usage in India. What can you advise me? I will arrive in Hyderabad so I will be looking to buy a SIM there asap. Same with money. how to recognize reputable money exchanges?

 I will be staying in one of the hotels in Hitech City around Whitefields. I'm interested in seeing historically/architecturally nice things.

Any unsavory neighborhoods I should avoid? Any notorious tourist scams? What mode of transportation you advise, can I take one of those motorized rickshaws or should I play safe and take a normal taxi?

I get obsessed about new hobbies for a while and then I stop them,"I am noticing a pattern with myself. I feel like I want to try new things, initially I spend lot of time researching, how to start, what all things to buy etc.. once I buy those things, it slowly fades away. I don't even feel like I am interested in those. 

I have wasted a lot of time. But moreover I feel bad about my behaviour. Here are some things I tried in the last year and how I wasted money

1. Bought an expensive guitar. Thought I will learn guitar, so bought Yamaha F310. I spent a month researching which guitar to buy, which sites to follow to learn guitar etc. I didn;t even practise for a week. Now it is gathering dust.

2. Photography. Everyone suggested don't buy an expensive camera. But I thought, photography is the one. Bought an expensive Nikon 7 series DSLR. Played around it for a month. But thats it. Now, I dont even feel like taking photos. 

3. Books. I don't read books at all. So I thought I will start reading and develop this hobby. This interest also peaked when there was a thread on randia in book suggestions. I bought most of the books which were suggested in that thread (close to 20 I think). Till today I haven't moved past first chapter of a book.

4. Drones. They were all craze last year. Bought DJI Spark and never really used it. Sold it off OLX after 6 months, bearing heavy losses. 

5. Online Mooc courses. Signed up, but never completed. Good thing coursera charges monthly basis and you can cancel anytime you want to.

6. Drawing / Doodling. Thought I will try this as a hobby. Bought so many learning material, books, sheets, pencils etc etc. In this list, this prolly is the least expensive one.

7. I guess you get the gist now. So I will just mention things: carpentry, cooking, play station 4 (though sold it off quickly with minimal loss), bicycle, skateboard, gym membership, home gym equipments, arduino electronic kits, trekking materials 

all of these have a same pattern:

1. first I find about or learn about something new on reddit or from some people trying it out. It could be entirely a new thing which I never heard of OR some thing which I never tried earlier.

2. Next I spend insane amount of time researching it. Sometimes this goes over months. (e.g. for camera, drone etc). I try to read online about each and every thing. Product related or user experiences. Sometimes I have even made notes on these things

3. I spend money, get the things which are required. 

4. I try out for couple of days to couple of weeks. Then I completely stop. 

5. Post this period, I don't even feel like thinking about or learning.

5. I feel so guilty of this, I avoid encountering those things. For example, most of the stuff is hidden or kept away in cupboard so that I don't look at them everyday. I avoid whatsapp / telegram related groups, like photography groups etc completely. 

6. Then I find something new to obsess about and the whole thing repeats.

The reasons why are listed below:

1)She started school in Sept 2018. He showed up months later in Feb 2019

2)They got married the summer of 2018 right before she came to Canada

3)He doesn't speak English very well at all.

4)The pictures he shows me of his wedding only have 7-10 people in them, which I find very odd for an Indian wedding

5) She tells me she comes from a home that has 23 family members living in it and she comes from a poorer family.

His family is very wealthy and the home his parents have is almost a mansion compared to Canadian standards.

Which makes me think his parents just married him to her because she is super smart and speaks perfect English.( Easy way to get in as a spouse, While she is on student visa)

6) I did her tax papers for her and she had to ask him if I should put them as married for taxes. ( seemed odd to have to ask your husband if you're married or not)

7) When chatting with another Indian girl in her class she told me she suspects its a fake marriage also.

8) He is very clingy, he takes her phone with him and monitors everything she does 24/7

9) She had bruises on her neck 2 different times in 2 different months

10) The way they act seems like it's just for show.

11) He's 28 and she is 19 years old.

I am travelling to India (from France) in few weeks during few days for business. I take the opportunity of the flight to take extra days (one week) and visit India by myself.  
Though, I am not at all an experienced traveller at all, and even more as solo. And to be fair, I know only a few about India ! I am looking for some recommandations regarding travelling plans and tourism behaviour :)   


Since I will start my solo experience from Bangalore, I am focusing on South India for travel facility.   
I obviously don't have the time to visit everything, so I got interesting in focusing on Bangalore itself, Coimbatore and Madurai.   
Though, I underestimated the scale of the country (poor little France) and they look very far ahead, I am not sure about the public transport 'quality' :  
\- Is that easily doable to visit these three places in 7 days (including transport) ?   
\- How easy, good and cheap are the public transports in India ?   
\- Which city would have the best country-side surroundings to visit ? I don't expect to have the time to visit that in every city but I would love to see other things than cities if possible (Coimbatore's looks great !)  


Regarding tourism itself, I have other questions :  
\- Some other reddit posts convinced me that drinking tap water and eating street food is a really bad idea. How true is it ? Is there any must-know things like these that I should be aware of ?  
\- Is English spoken everywhere or some cities/local places are not speaking English at all? I will mostly visit cities so I think that my business english would be enough but who knows :P  
\- Last question, more like a prayer : is there any good / safe service that would facilitate a temporary travel equipment, like renting a backpack or something like that ? Since I come to India for business reasons at first, I will mostly come with a case and not a backpack. It looks like I have to be well prepared for heat so any suited equipment for some hiking would be appreciated  
\- Last question : should I get high standards about hostels ? (regarding quality and safety)   


Sorry for this flood of question, it has been planned on the rush because of the opportunity that appeared so I prefered asking these to you to facilitate my plans and search

I wonder what you guys think about it? Is it: 

Positive, it is a totally acceptable reason and the person was right to warn others, water crisis is a huge problem in India and water is not a luxurious demand but necessity, the person is also being extra kind for caring about Indians, more water should be saved for Indians instead of foreign visitors so tourists should indeed avoid visiting India

Negative, it was not the appropriate occasion to say it, many problems of India are also blown out of proportion by western media and the person may have preconceived notions about India being a third world country that can't have anything nice or do anything properly, the person was being racist especially since he was replying to an Indian 

I'd also like to hear: 

Whatever you wish to say, your personal experience, knowledge and belief about current water crisis, racism against Indians, unreliability of media, etc, tell us how significant or insignificant these problems appear to you, how concerned should Indians or foreigners be about these problems and what is the right attitude to confront or solve them",c727ui,,false,/r/india/comments/c727ui/can_water_crisis_be_a_reason_to_avoid_visiting/,AskIndia

I got into a dual degree course at IIIT Hyderabad (CLD - CS and Computational Linguistics) and will probably get into JU for Electrical Engineering.

I like CS and coding and am most comfortable with CS among all engineering disciplines, but I don't want a tech career, was instead looking towards Finance and Consulting. IIIT is very CS oriented also has heavy research, and does not place in finance or consulting companies. (I believe there are restrictions as far as internships go from 2nd year onwards. ) The math courses appeared to me as less than intensive, which is also a minus, in my eyes.  
I had applied abroad this year, so my JEE ranks suffered, but I scored a 120+ in JEE Advanced with minimal prep, so I think if I take a drop year, I am quite I shall do well. But I am wary about taking that leap, to get something that's better as compared to IIIT-H dual degree.

My parents have given me a choice:

1. Leave IIIT and drop (may not get IIIT again, or even a decent branch anywhere)
2. Go to IIIT, forget about interests for now, pursue them in free time, hope for MBA.  
3)Go to IIIT and drop (which I think is impossible because of how hectic IIIT is)

What should I do?  
And if you recommend IIIT, how difficult is it to break into a career in finance from there? (I dont mean strats analyst roles, IBD, M&amp;A more like)",c74fbm,,false,/r/india/comments/c74fbm/iiith_versus_jupartial_drop_for_financeconsulting/,AskIndia

After reading online about the work environment, nature of managers and quality of work in TCS I feel even more depressed. I don't have any backup plan like GATE or CAT as well and even the thought of preparing for competitive exams scares me after the whole IIT JEE thing. Though deep down I want to do something of my own like startup or earning through side projects, youtube channel, blog etc but after reading about the long work hours, shitty managers at TCS I don't thing I will be having time and energy to work on these things. The shitty salary in place like mumbai, 1 year bond, 3 months notice period, all these things feel like a jail to me. What should I do? Should I join TCS or not?

&amp;#x200B;

Friday eve: I had a mild fever with headache for a few days and therefore went to see a doctor. The doctor suspected Typhoid and did an onsite test -- he had a kit, put in a few drops of blood and in 15 minutes the doctor said that I am positive for Typhoid. He put me on heavy medications, and took two dozes, one at night and one in the morning. I do feel better.

&amp;#x200B;

Sat morning: But I wanted to make sure that I had Typhoid, so I went to Dr Path Lab and the report there says Negative.

&amp;#x200B;

I am confused - do I have typhoid or not? More importantly, can two dozes of medication make typhoid ""not visible"" in my blood sample?

1) what the hell is with the landline, how could anyone be stupid enough to connect the landline with the router, fuck i have to keep the modem switched on a 24*7 or no landline connectivity. these fucktards ever heard of overheating  

2) of course the landline connection is itself a pain in the ass. fucking takes too long between consecutive rings, one might think it even got disconnected after the first ring  

3) the shitty shitty whyphy, motherfucker i want to kill the salesman who said i would be getting 50-60 mbps, the speed that i get is even lower than their low speed data that should be around 1 mbps, fucker reminds me of the gprs/edge days which still might be faster because of low data requirement for the page  

4) the stupidest and tardiest customer service ever, first you have to wait a whoopass 20 fucking minutes on the phone listening to the fucking jio tone or whatever, if that doesn't fry your brains, then the customer service guy/gal will. they are the fucking most typical indian customer service guys you can imagine. For a moment I thought i was in the south park episode with customer support and the vr headset. If you have seen Kenny's and kanan's maa ki dal sketch, then this guy is even worse than kenny. the same guy is the customer support and the floor manager and the technical team and yet they don't know shit  

enough with rant, i had some question for my borthers who got baited  

 * if any jio gigafiber users have figured a workaround for the landline, do tell mate  
 * how is your wi-fi speed, please tell me it gets better  
 * and yes any data hoarder or torrent user, does gigafiber have port forwarding, i have made all firewall exceptions, enabled upnp and still not able to open a port  

edit: i mentioned port forwarding in the last line incorrectly, i wanted to know about upnp support on jio, cause  with most CGNAT enabled isps, asking for static ip's becomes costly, so i had been using upnp to seed which can be easily enabled on the modem webpage. previously i had been using airtel and they had this service, what is the case with jio?",bysss1,,false,/r/india/comments/bysss1/askindia_how_is_your_jio_gigafiber_connection/,AskIndia

I have lived away from home for the past 2 and half years. I miss my parents when I am away but I also enjoy my freedom. My parents are typical Indian parents who know no boundaries, especially my father. He is of the opinion that the younger generation should accommodate the elders whether it's good for them or not. For example, I am disgusted by slimy home made butter and often gag or puke when I consume it, he feels I should eat it nevertheless because that would make my mother feel better. He also tracks my Uber or ola wherever I go, even when he knows I am only coming home in the middle of the day. Basically, he knows no bounds and he thinks its completely fine. He berates me often and belittles me constantly saying really hateful and hurtful things, which is why we don't get along very well anymore. But I do love him and I know he does too. 

Now, I used to work at a law firm in another city but have, now, decided to pursue my masters in a completely different city which would mean I wouldn't be able to come home on weekends or for months altogether. My father wants to move to that city so I live them but I don't want to live with my parents because the course is quite rigorous and strenuous and I think I would do better in a hostel where I have the space and peace that will enable me to study more efficiently. When I told him it's illogical to shift city when his retirement funds are already low and waste them because I won't be able to support him and it makes no sense for the entire family to move cities, he has gone on a rant (still on going) on how I am going to abandon them in their old age and how he wants to live with me so I can re-learn to accommodate him and his whims and how if he doesn't live with me now, I may not be able to adjust with them or anyone (I am also unmarried) ever again.

What do I do? Am I wrong and am I really abandoning them? What do I do to make this better! I wish I could just change his controlling mindset and get him to do something with his time but he refuses to!

The motive was to watch the retreat, the March past and pay our homage to the lives lost in the bloodshed the land has seen during partition. 

No doubt, Patriotism and Nationalism were the themes on both sides. But we were borderline disgusted by the scenes there. Before the retreat, there was an announcement calling kids to run around with the tricolour. I suppose that happens on both sides. It's something that has become kind of a custom. It was nice to watch exhibition of love for their land from both countries. 

However, what we were appalled by was that post the kids thing, there was an announcement calling out ladies, in specific, to the retreat area to dance. There were like 2-300 ladies secured between barricades, dancing on club versions of Bollywood patriotic songs. During this, obviously, there were comments and derogatory remarks flying out the mouths of filthy minds around us. It was really disgraceful and an uncalled event. 

In our opinions, it violated the sanctity of that place.

Millions of lives were affected by the partition of the land. Visiting a place which commemorates the events should revolve around the countless sacrifices made by people from one land. The land divided into 2 as a result of rifts created by our colonisers as a political tool. The dancing and partying didn't really pay any homage to those affected by the dark times in the history of India. I think the best way to do it is to observe silence on both sides and remind the public that peace and friendships must prevail in the end. 

The Pakistani side of the border was mainly empty because Ramzaan time and also they were thrashing England on that day in the CWC. So I don't know if they also have the dancing thing going on usual days. Also the capacities of both seating areas have a LOT of difference. India has a capacity of around 10,000 and I estimate around 1500-2000 seats on the ""other side"". 

However, it was amazing to walk on the historic silk route.

My dad has a Jio number and he didn't have any active plans on it. Since no packs are active, he couldn't make phone calls. So he asked me to recharge the number with talk-time. Which I did of Rs 100. But the ""talktime"" was simply shown in the My Jio app as balance, and it still said ""No Plans Active"". Which means, even after the ""talktime"" recharge, we couldn't make calls.

I didn't know this was the case. So I checked my Airtel, for which I have the Rs 399 pack with 1GB internet per day with Unlimited calls. After this pack ran out, I checked recharging my Airtel number with talktime value and the same problem as in Jio happened. The value was shown on my account. But I couldn't use it as talktime. WTF is this? 

I have a BSNL SIM as well, for which the talktime recharge works fine. As I call, the money gets deducted from the talktime value as expected.

I remember pre-Jio days when all the operators had the talktime plans. Now its all a bundle with "" x GB data per day with unlimited calls and SMS"".

So, how does one go about just calling from a number, without spending on subscription based bundles? These bundles are fine for people who want internet AND phone calls. But what about others? My dad does not need internet on his phone as he is retired and is at home with unlimited WiFi. He just needs to make phone calls every now and then.

I was wrongly influenced by the articles on the internet criticizing traditional education(the ones that motivate you to drop out) and quickly lost interest in education. Just studied to pass exams without understanding anything. I learnt to code from my 6th grade. 9th grade was when I gotten my hands on C, till then I was just playing around with BASIC,FORTRAN,HTML,etc. Just when I started getting better with C, I got bored of learning it in the traditional way. I stopped learning it properly.. I just wanted to build cool programs and started googling and using stack exchange to build what I want. To be honest I was just building a program by copying blocks of code from the internet.... Quickly stopped that even doing that.
I am not from a very well to do family. My parents risked it all to put me in a top tier private university. They took loans to be able to afford my education. In my college, I took part in multiple tech teams and built many things. While I built things combining bits and pieces of information on the internet, I never really learnt anything in the process. I flunked in exams. I just memorised huge paragraphs only to write in the exam and forget. Passed out of college this year with a very mediocre GPA. The placements in our college wasn't any good. I couldn't get into the 1 or 2 companies that I tried off-campus. 
I have to start paying my education loan installments.. My parents are very supportive and told me that they would take care of it and asked me to do what I want to. But I feel like shit giving them more burdens even after they had done so much for me.
Most of my friends are placed or they are pursuing masters. Everyone around me feels I'm very talented and is suprised about the fact that I still haven't got a job. But I feel I am really not that talented.
It has it me hard that I have wasted around 6-7 years of my life. I have been a jack of few trades and King of none. The easy availability of solutions in the internet has  stopped me from thinking for a solution by myself. The result is a stupdier me. 
Uff, it been a long rant.  
Coming to what I wanted to ask...
I want to write good software... That's what I want to do. I want to be a professional developer. If I choose to do it right this time, I am sure I would need atleast an year or two to be able to be employed atleast in the junior level. Given my financial situation I cannot afford to be jobless for more than a month or two at the worst. I really don't know what I should. I lost all motivation and confidence... I am literally feeling like shit everyday. Hoping to hear good suggestions from y'all... Thanks!

I have a HP Omen 15 (2019 Model) with a RTX 2060. I want to use a 43"" 4k tv as an everyday monitor now. I read a lot about the Chroma 4:4:4:4 ratings and how they are very important for the texts to be clear. Now, does anybody use a 4k tv with the Chroma 4:4:4:4 ratings? Can you please tell me about the model and brand of the tv and hopefully a picture of how clear the texts are on the websites?

Also, Can my graphic card support the 43"" 4K TV? 

P.S: I am looking at this as a replacement for the bulky 4 FHD monitor setup i currently have. I would primarily be using this monitor for a web dashboard related work and not for gaming. All i need is a lot of screen real estate. At least enough to have 4 chrome pages adjacent to each other.

But I feel that maybe avoiding other vegetables and wheat from the diet and also also (not my opinion) that the body absolutely needs daily minimum oil requirements  which if not taken would harm the body. Please guide me about this if anyone has tried it.

Sometimes I eat once a day because my body doesn't feel hungry. I have been scolded about it by my parents a lot of times.  So please tell me about that too.

I can't stick to a particular company and field. Don't know what career field to choose ahead.,"BG: I was academically an above average student in schools. Didn't had money for engineering so chose commerce and completed Bcom. Simultaneously started CA studies but after internship my studies and interest in having a career went down. Failed CA finals a lot many times. So, decided to go for jobs.
After internship, worked in an Accounts KPO co., left it in 4 months. Later on joined a small broking firm. Couldn't handle its shitty working conditions and left it in 2 weeks without pay.
At the end of 2018 after holding myself mentally, I joined an Investment Banking Analytics firm and it was the best thing to happen in my life. Though the job was more MS Excel oriented I was quite happy with both the job and work culture for the first time in my career, made some good friends in the team. Just 1 month ago, life decided to fuck me again as I was shifted to a different team and I hate the environment and working culture of this team. This team works literally like 10-11 hrs a day and its manager is a control freak.
I talked with the manager about not liking the current team and he says my reasons aren't justified, so he asks me either to quit or remain in the current team and see what we can do after few months.
I am struggling after office hrs as well, mentally I am drained. I am thinking of quitting the job.
But I have to find a career or a field wherein I can sustain interest for a long period of time.
I am quite lost. Please help out and advise what a Commerce guy with a half CA degree could do in this situation.

P.S.: I am in no position to complete my CA final. I have literally 0 interest in studying for it and clearing. Also, my family being from an uneducated and labourer's background doesn't have a great financial security.

1561878078,ripple_guy,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c7a9xg/why_is_india_so_unprofessional_and_full_of/,18,30,,,Why is India so unprofessional and full of scammers?,"This is a story of how I got scammed a month ago while trying to travel back to my home city from Delhi. So I had gone to Delhi to submit my application to get my work visa for my new job abroad. I was sick and not feeling my best. My home City is few hours by bus so that’s the option I take whenever I need to visit Delhi as booking a flight doesn’t make sense.

While I was coming back from the Immigration office of the respective country, to the bus station two guys asked where I’m going. They were these private bus guys who offer you bus tickets. I know the unprofessional behaviour of any kind of these guys right from bus ticket offerers to pimps so I just stay away from them. But my sickness made me to give it a try and that was a big mistake.

I asked for the ticket price and he quoted 1300 or something. I didn’t exactly remember what the official price was since I had made the arrival journey by my friend’s car. But I was sick and desperately wanted to not walk more I decided to trust them. And I was fucked.

They asked me to follow them and took me to their private bus ticket office or whatever that shit was and gave me a ticket. There was another couple as well, and it looked like they weren’t very well off. They too were buying tickets. When I asked them the price they said they paid 1400 each. Once I bought the tickets they sent us via an e rickshaw to a nearby place where the bus was.

And on entering the bus I realised that I was an idiot to trust a guy in India. The bus was full of people, didn’t have proper ac and was just overall inferior in quality. I took a seat since I had paid but later a guy who was running the ‘operations’ inside the bus asked me to give seat to the couple that was with me, not sure why maybe because single guys are usually the bottom of the barrel here. And he was really rude. 

I wasn’t in mood of a fight and I knew I’d be more fucked if I tried since I was sick and alone. I was pissed so I just exited the bus, went back to the station and bought the ticket from the bus stop. And when I entered the bus the difference was day and night. I couldn’t believe I paid an equal amount of money for that shit.

What was even more surprising is that there are people who constantly pay that money probably because they don’t know how they are being offered inferior services by these assholes. Most people in the last bus looked ok, maybe they’re used to travelling in such buses. The couple that was with me in fact payed a bit more than me. If they had bought the ticket for the government bus from the bus stand then they had paid less and travelled in a 10 times better bus.

Just makes me feel that one wrong step over here can lead you to getting scammed. Trusting others can be dangerous. The government should just ban these guys from the bus stand or make people more aware of these scammers.  I made a mistake but I’m sure many people especially the uneducated ones don’t know better.  I think they feel that these are how things are.",c7a9xg,,false,/r/india/comments/c7a9xg/why_is_india_so_unprofessional_and_full_of/,AskIndia

It is impossible to contact any of the customers who paid from PhonePe as the transaction doesnt even exist and there is no way of getting their information.

My argument points were: 1)Healthcare is really expensive,2) Indians will always considered  second rate citizens,3) economy does not favor the lower and middle class and makes it much harder to sustain a family of 4 than what it will be in India,4) legal problems and police matters siphon away time and energy more than what it will cost in india,5) the quality of life that everyone dreams of costs a lot of money in the name of taxes, 6)you will never be able to enjoy life like a white American and that's just true.7) everything from starting a business to buying groceries is more expensive than what it cost for the same thing in India.

He gave me his reasons why he thinks USA is the best country to live in and  why I'm wrong:1) the country has a better constitution and protects the citizens much better than Indian constitution, 1) police actually helps people instead of extorting them and isn't corrupt like indian police, 2) citizens get a fair chance at life and if they are talented they can get successful unlike india where even talented people can never make it big even if they tried, 3) no nepotism and people aspire to make a name for themselves unlike india where actor's son is actor , politicians son is politician, doctors son is doctor,etc.4) much much better climate and no pollution, cleanliness and sanitation are actually a priority unlike india where its a political stance to get votes and publicity. 5) life is easier compared to india and if you're any bit competent you can make a living. 

Now we're both thet Desis and have never been outside even our state let alone the country and all that we know about any country is through internet. If anyone who's lived in USA or currently lives in USA is reading this tell me who is more wrong me or my brother.",c7dum7,,false,/r/india/comments/c7dum7/how_is_life_different_for_an_indian_in_usa/,AskIndia

Whenever I use to watch a movie, I use to tell him the story. I remember, telling him story of SpiderMan 3 at that time.

So, for this movie, I don't know why I was tired so I told him to lay down on the sofa and I will lay down beside him to tell the story. He lied down stomach first, there was less space, so I did the same but not on top of him but on the side. Now, I had just discovered masturbation around that time, so at the start the story he closed his eyes but kept listening. Then I don't know why I put my hand slowly on his back inside his shirt.

And I started slowly humping the sofa. The only touch I had with him, was my hand on his back. That's it. But yeah, I slowly started masturbating. I don't know why. And I think I told him the story of some other movie too, same way, but I didn't do it that time, I can't remember exactly.

But I did it once and then I realized that something is off about this whole thing. I didn't know if what I did was wrong, but I just felt guilty so I stopped. And didn't do it again.

But, I still feel guilty about it, I am not sure if he remembers that, I didn't talk to him about this although we do talk like once in 3 months, we have a good brotherhood bond, but I feel guilty and I don't want to remind him about this. What to do? How do I get this guilt out of me? And more importantly, am I child molester?",c7gvh9,,false,/r/india/comments/c7gvh9/im_25_year_old_guy_now_when_i_was_1213_i_might/,AskIndia

Her boss has screamed at her in front of her colleagues and a senior manager has made several sexual advances that she has avoided. Recently she got employed at another location and put in her resignation to serve her notice period.

As soon as she put in her notice, the company executives sent her a 'Show Cause Notice.' In my opinion the 'show cause' notice does not have any concrete evidence to support any of the claims the management has made to terminate her. By concrete I mean, an email or an audio/video recording that is supporting evidence. It's all hearsay stuff. Here is a snapshot of what they wrote in the notice:

*""It has been brought to our notice that you have engaged in inappropriate behavior at the workplace, following concerns have been highlighted:*

*- Inappropriate and unwarranted discussions with colleagues to defame and demean your supervisor,*

*- Impacting the overall wellbeing of the department by creating a negative and hostile environment,*

*- unprofessional behavior as a team member.""*

My sister is really stressed  and does not know what to do. She has to respond to the notice.

Background :

 

\- I have completed my Btech from a tier 2 college, but during my engineering, I was always doing projects and working on one thing or the other. Made projects in Image processing, Django, Node.js, Machine learning, etc. 

\- Got placed in a service based company, but then I was hearing a lot of “They just put you in the testing section because we are from tier2, (and i can see that happening to my friends who did join)”. So I didn't take that offer and planned to do masters or job in a product based company. 

\- Then GATE happened, I got a score of 560, which wasn't enough for the colleges i was aiming for. I kind of compromised in my undergrad college and i didn't want to compromise on this, so i didn't join any college. Meanwhile, I was also studying my data science stack. 

\- After that, I completely focused on the data science, I’m enrolled in the AppliedAI course which will take around 6 more months to complete (It has like theory and assignments, so i have completed the theory and working on assignments)

\- Now the thing is, there are many people coming into the ML domain and also people who are tired of their jobs, like testing etc, they are switching to DS too. So obviously companies will prefer someone with any experience, that's a negative point for me. 

with each passing day, my gap year is increasing and i don't know what to do.

I recently watched the movie on prime. It's probably the only other telugu movie I've watched since Bahubali. And safe to say, I'm traumatized. 

He is an abuser. In the name of anger, he almost rapes a girl in the beginning. He threatens her at knife point. He almost throws a flower pot at the lead's sister. The way he lashes in anger at his girlfriend and everyone else and never apologizes is shocking. 

The girl is controlled. Right from the moment she steps into the college, he controls who she can speak with. He gives advice along the lines of ""make a fat friend so you get noticed more"" (He also scolds someone else for OBJECTIFYING WOMEN????) Okay, they get into a relationship properly. But then, all I know about Preethi is that she loves Arjun Reddy. That's all. That's all is there to her character. 

After he whores around whilst having a broken heart, he is forgiven, his anger issues are not tackled, he gets back with the girl, and they live happily ever after???  A fitting end would have been his downfall, as it should be. 

The abuse was handled so so so so so badly. He recovers in a day??? He does as he pleases, goes to no therapy, and everything is okay because he is brilliant? 

Also, the blatant casteism.  ""I curse you to marry a Tulu guy"",  just because what he wanted didn't happen? "" I will make her mine"".  That is not love. That is a sign of a disturbed, controlling, abusive guy. He needs jail or therapy.

Okay, apparently this movie has shown kissing and pre marital sex and is ""PROGRESSIVE"". BUT IT IS SO GODDAMN painful to watch. I cannot stand the abuse. The moment he went all "" pants only, no need of top"" in the beginning, I felt it. What the hell is this script? 

And why is such behavior NORMALISED in the name of LOVE of all things?

The law states that any woman above 18 years needs only her own consent for going through with the procedure. 

So does anyone know any hospital where they do not need such parent's consent ? 

It will be so helpful ! 
Very stressful. Kindly help if you have any experience in this

UPDATE: We were able to go through with the process in the same SIMS hospital. 
The first time when we went, the doctor never mentioned that the hospital requires parents consent but it was the receptionist. 
The receptionist called me separately and told me that. .It struck me as odd and we decided to go to SIMS and ask the doctor himself. 
It was all fine. 
We are feeling relieved .

I had planned on doing engineering when I took science in class 11th. Took JEE coaching and all, the whole shebang. But since the last year or so it has dawned upon me that I don't really want to do engineering. But the problem with that is that I don't actually know what I want to do. So I wholeheartedly focussed on my board exams so that I atleast have a good score and see where it takes me. I scored a decent 93.25%. 

Now since I didn't know what I wanted to pursue, I tried to give all entrance exams other than engineering. Like for law, BBA, etc. Other option I have is BA/BA(Hons) from Delhi University. 

I will most probably not get into any top tier college in any stream. However, I still have shortlisted some courses that I am targeting. One of them is BA LLB from OP Jindal or any other similar private college which are way too expensive but can be streched somehow. The other option is BA/BA(hons) from DU. 

Assuming I am able to secure admission into both these targets, I still will be confused on what to pursue.

What I wanted to know about is what exactly are the job/higher education opportunities after any of these courses from an average college for an average student. Like what are the opportunities after a BA LLB? Is it easy to get a job? Or does it become necessary to go for LLM? What kind of jobs can one expect after just bachelor's? 

Or suppose I go to DU. Then which course should I pursue? General BA or BA hons? My preference course is BA hons Sociology. However I have very little idea on what exactly the students do after a BA hons sociology. Why I prefer this is because I think there might be some social research opportunities if I do MA or go even higher. Also I might have chances of getting into Social Work field. 

What exactly are the realistic options available after a BA/BA hons? Although I am open to Pol Sc, history etc but I have even less idea on what people do after graduating. 

I thought if I have a fair idea of what type of carrer paths these courses take me to, I might be in a better position to decide on which course to take. 

So if any of you guys have taken up or know of someone who did one of these courses, it would be really helpful if you could share your knowledge/experiences.

While I expect most people to complain about merit or whatever. I'm wondering about people who can think past that. Yes, it will mean women will be set up as puppet candidates, but then men are set up as puppet candidates all the time. So we arent losing on anything.

Have 2 years exp in marketing at a mid-sized European company.I've been wanting to do my MBA for a while now so considering the following options:

1. Attempted CAT last year after studying for 3 months. Got 88%, found the quants part very hard. Even if I study super hard I doubt I'll get 98.5 to get into IIM's.
2. Give the GMAT instead &amp; try for ISB instead. It's pricey but also 1 year less. I'm younger on the age &amp; WE side so getting an admit seems difficult.
3. Applying abroad: I'm looking at Canada ( Rotman &amp; Ivey ) as it's immigrant-friendly. Their colleges &amp; salaries aren't as good as USA but at least there won't be a lottery for visa. Vancouver seems to be an amazing place to live!
4. Take the risk for USA schools. Some of them have started offering STEM MBA's so I'll have the 3 years OPT &amp; multiple shots at H1b. Plus they might get a more immigrant-friendly president next year although it's still a big risk as I've read so many horror stories of people coming back with large student loans.

Is it worth it for a CS aspirant? I found a cheaper one in Canada with a tuition fee of 11000 CAD/annum (Memorial University of Newfoundland). Other than that, all the universities have a 20-30k CAD/annum fee. 

On the other hand, here in India, I would get a tier-3 private University (Bennett University, Noida). My long term goal is to settle abroad in a first world country (Canada preferably) with a decent paying job. Plus my sister is also going there[CAN] for her Masters [I also got some relatives there]. 

I have heard things like plagiarism not taken seriously here, students purchasing projects, emphasis given only on theory, exam pressure, professors being egoistic etc which indeed is disheartening me. Seeing Bennett University's CS curriculum based on Georgia Tech University makes me feel somewhat better, albeit it is a recently established universitiy. Another benefit of studying abroad will be that I would have a much better environment and well organised system for everything. Better mindset of people and less dishonesty in every walk of life[no offence]. More availability of goods and services. Eg- I had difficulty finding a sonicare electric toothbrush here, a gaming laptop with 16 series graphic card,waterpik ,floss, ergonomic chair, a Python programming book etc. These all things have happened in recent time. I mean, goods are available here, but either their quality isn't on par or they are overpriced[mainly due to high import duties]. You may think I'm being all negative but I have experienced many of these things irl. Even my dentist didn't tell me about the cavity I had in my molar, I discovered it when it became worse. I can't generalize things but many are prevalent here in India.

My parents are being conservative and they are reluctant for sending me abroad for Bachelors. This is because my cousins and my father's friends oppose the idea of moving abroad. Though they agree to send me there for Masters, but immigration rules may change over time.

So the question is, is spending money on an undergraduate degree abroad worth more than doing it here? 4 years is a lot of time and I don't want to spend it in vain.

City &amp; Regional Planning is also referred as Urban planning, regional planning, town planning, city/rural planning, urban development.

Urban planning is a technical and political process concerned with the development and design of land use and the built environment, including air, water, and the infrastructure passing into and out of urban areas, such as transportation, communications, and distribution networks. Urban planning deals with physical layout of human settlements. The primary concern is the public welfare, which includes considerations of efficiency, sanitation, protection and use of the environment, as well as effects on social and economic activities. Urban planning is considered an interdisciplinary field that includes social, engineering and design sciences. It is closely related to the field of urban design and some urban planners provide designs for streets, parks, buildings and other urban areas.

Let’s make this Sub-Reddit where Planners, Architects and Engineer can share knowledge, and gain knowledge.

I’m a BBA graduate from a top tier college in the country and have been working in the financial services industry for close to two years now. I’m planning on taking the GMAT (primarily for ISB and SPJIMR) and CAT this year, and am looking for advice to structure my prep. I’m pretty comfortable with English and feel it wouldn’t be a problem, but I know I’ll need to work on math, especially because I come from a non-engineering background. 

The questions I have for anybody who’s been there before are:
 1. What should a broad timeline to schedule my GMAT prep? I’m thinking of taking it in a month/two so that I can spend time preparing for CAT afterwards and be eligible for Round 1 ISB admissions. 
2.	Where do I start? I feel I can crack these without enrolling in coaching as long as I stay disciplined. 
3.	Really any prep strategy that worked for you and you feel would work for me?

The colleges I’m looking at are IIM ABC, XLRI, ISB, SPJIMR.

What ends up happening is that you buy a size 9 or 10 shoe when say your actual length is 8 and again the shoe doesn’t fit properly as its too long for your feet.

I consider myself to be adequately sincere student (9.2 gpa), but I just don't like living away from my family.

I spent my 11th and 12th in hostel, living months at a time without meeting my family, didn't feel anything about that in those times.
But ever since getting into second year of engineering, the only thing I look forward to are the off days on which I will be going to my home (which is far away from my college). I even put countdown days widget on my mobile home screen to get motivated for passing the days somehow. 

I can't understand anything taught in my classes (even if others do), going in just for attendence, but I am not a dull student since I understand the same things from books much quicker.

Don't get me wrong, I can spend hours upon hours coding. I like computer science, and in general engineering. 
But there's just this void I feel inside when I'm off somewhere far away from home. I can't feel the same joy and happiness I used to feel when I was at home with family.
 
I know this all sounds pathetic and I'm aware of it, but no amount of Netflix, or studies feels my void inside. Many times tears come off without any reason, which I have to shed in bathroom because roommates will think of me as a weak person (which I may be,actually). 

What am I supposed to do? 

I can't quit engineering now because gone too deep now and  also 'lok kya kahenge'..

He has been training MMA for 7+ years now. He's pretty good at it. He won some national level championships last year.

He has worked in some indie films (as a trainer) but the pay is very low. His marks are not good but I can't blame him because he can't afford to go to tuitions or buy a lot of reference books. He has worked as a newspaper delivery boy, a server in a street food store etc.

He doesn't know what he will do after 12th. My situation is better than him but not in a position where I can actively help him. 

So I wanted some advice. And this is the only place that came to my mind. What can he do as a career? He personally wants to compete at UFC but most likely it won't be possible.

I have started a non-profit Instagram page where i am posting pictures taken by friends of high quality showing strange and beautiful and happy and sad, facets of India, i want others to find out the beauty of this place.

&amp;#x200B;

so i came here hoping to ask for your help.

If any of you are photographers and have taken some high quality pics that you don't mind sharing, i would be most appreciative, since i don not want to use google images but to give something of the rare and beautiful high quality pics.

And just wondered that if there is a huge popularity of these videos (as also self-help books), there must be some psychosocial need that the majority is being unable to meet, and these videos are trying to meet them (or pretending to be?).



**Edit:** Aren't there any Psychologists at Randia?

- Anyways, after some more exploration, I also came across [Humanistic Psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanistic_psychology): with a brief look, I would say that if you consider the concept of self-help spooky, you might put this in the same category. Maslow's theory comes here.
- A better school of Psychology is [Positive Psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_psychology) - this, seems, really worthy.
- Psychoanalysis and Behavioral Psychology are the more commonly known schools (to me, at least).",c3kyj0,,false,/r/india/comments/c3kyj0/what_do_psychologists_on_randia_think_of_sandeep/,AskIndia

I don't have the budget for new MacBook Air and this kinda fits perfectly within my budget.

I want to know if it is a good choice to still buy this? I will probably end up using it for 2 years. Or should I try and go for same model but with 8 GB ram as I'm not sure if 4 GB will be sufficient for running Chrome. 

Use case:

1. Legal Research and Drafting. Microsoft Word and PDFs should work smoothly.

2. Web browsing. As I'm going to use it for legal research, I will have 10-15 tabs open in chrome. 

3. Battery life. I need it to last at least 4-5 hours without the need to charge.

4. Portability. Needs to be light weight and easy to carry around. 


Also, this is going to be my first Mac. My old Windows laptop which has 4 GB ram is not sufficient to run Chrome (as it eats up a lot of ram) even though it has a SSD and battery backup on that isn't great anymore.",c3lkqo,,false,/r/india/comments/c3lkqo/macbook_air_mid2013_still_worth_buying/,AskIndia

So I was wondering if you've a startup or did and it failed for some reason or the other, how was the experience? What lessons did you learn from it? Do you've plans for another one? What were some bureaucratic hurdles you have faced and how are you supposed to tackle them?

A fact that caught me by surprise was that the IT sector contributes 7.7% to the GNP which definitely correlates to the fact that the tech environment in the country isn't as impotent as suggested by various reports. Agreed that a significant portion of the software engineers are in need of a major reskilling but look at the bigger picture. India is a country of 1.3Bn people and out of it, for a small section of the populace who are into IT, to contribute close to 8% of the \~3Tn economy is damn huge! 

Considering this, it's hard to believe that, not even one of those millions strong IT workforce failed to come up with a noble and most importantly a sustainable business of his/her own. Anyway, that's just my opinion from looking at certain statistics and although numbers rarely lie but sometimes fail to portray a bigger picture of an underlying issue.

I'm looking to having an open discussion here and if it works out maybe I could try out a scheduled discussion thread on startups, to discuss everything from ideas to official procedures, etc. So tell me more about your startup(s) and help me understand the startup scenario better in this country.",c3magi,,false,/r/india/comments/c3magi/disappointing_startup_environment_here_in_india/,AskIndia

Let’s talk about Narcissistic personality disorder and abusive relationships. I have put my experience here. Would like know other people experiences and how things went and how they recovered.,"  

A few months back I had posted a question on r/India to seek people’s opinions on their experience with broken engagement if they had any. In the post, I had mentioned my experiences of what happened in vague. 

Putting things in perspective, my engagement ended simply because I shared my past struggles and future career ambitions with my ‘to be wife’/fiancée.  Struggles were in general related to a sports injury, past relationship, career decisions. My sole motivation to let her know about few from past was, first that I was being honest and wanted my ‘to be’ to know me in and out before marriage. Practically speaking, if we can’t discuss our weaknesses, struggles, insecurities with our SO then there is definitely something wrong with the relationship.

Anyway, on my previous post, many people had replied. Most said that I had dodged a bullet while few held me responsible for whatever happened.

Now coming to present, I do have my closure. Moved on to better things in life. But the days and months post the breaking of engagement were really really horrible. A nightmare that I wish no one should go through.

What I realized after almost 5 months that I went through was Narcissistic Abuse. All the time I was suffering thinking that something is wrong with me and I am responsible for all the events. But it was the girl, my fiancée, she was a covert narcissist. They are the worst kind of human to ever stay in this world. This inference is not by me but by psychologists. Almost 4-5 months after the ending of engagement one day when I was simply browsing over the internet about abusive relationship, a word popped up, narcissism. It just struck me like a big slap on my face. The realisation came that what I went through were ditto 100 % match to what someone endures in a narcissistic relationship.  

A brief account of what happened pre and post engagement. 

It was simple case of arranged Indian marriage. Girl’s family were too keen for marriage. Initially girl presented her as very charming and was very acceptable with our match. Only issue with her was to take things slowly. I asked her why she is marrying me, she said I am honest mature etc etc and I have everything she wants in a prospective partner. Also, she wants to continue job, can’t cook, want to go office party and booze, support her parents financially, etc. I was cool with everything. I will even support your parents since now they are my parent too. 

But suddenly, after 2-3 weeks, slowly things changed. She slowly started avoiding any communication, started telling lies, blatant manipulation, showed controlling behaviour, became very passive aggressive. She would just give silent treatment out of nowhere. We were supposed to go together from our work city to our home town, get engaged next day and be back. During the whole journey, 6-7 hrs one side, she just did not talked to me. Just acted as if I have committed some crime. When I asked what’s wrong, she said everything is fine, I am just over reacting. She acted totally normal in front of other.

In the end, I knew something is wrong. I asked parents from both side to meet to sort our issue. Here is what she said or did. She said, I worry a lot, I take too much tension, I am a mamma’s boy, I work in a govt sector but she want someone in IT, I am 4 years older than her and wants someone of her age, I am immature, I am not fun, I am a nerd etc etc. She used my past experiences to spin it around as real issues. She blamed me of still having affair with my ex and blamed me of having physical relationship in past, she said I have very low confidence. Her father questioned my confidence and how am I able to do a job with responsibility. Her mother told that her daughter will love me after marriage if I make her feel safe. In the end, she compared me to a Karela (a very bitter vegetable which mostly no one likes) and said how can a karela be compared to mango.  She put a statement as her WA dp pointing towards me, “why so mean, coz I thought If I look unapproachable then you will not approach me”.

How I realised she was a narcissist. 

She herself has said she feels no emotions. Her twins bio, clearly mentions her as narcissistic. She was a master manipulator, pathological liar (I caught herself many number of times), had extreme abusive personality. Blamed my mother for scolding her but my mother never did. The classic stages of any narc relationship was there in my case too. Initial charm, then slow manipulation, torture for no reason at all and then final discard in which everything is blamed on you. I have undergone therapy after wards with couple of psychologist and psychiatrist. All of them pointed to issues with her mental state. Nothing was wrong with me, expect she had damaged me till the brinks of destruction. She said in the beginning that she has temper issues. People perceive her as having excessive attitude. She was extremely jealous of people. She never said anything good about her friends. She made sure, I don’t meet any one of her friend or colleague. She never shared anything deep about her although she asked everything from me. When I asked she would immediately change topics. There were many mind fukkary with her.  

Anyway I have moved on. The scars will always haunt me but the whole experience has actually changed me for the better. As for me, I know, I am pretty chill guy, quiet fun to be with, actually a real traveller, achieved a lot in my life, and also works as a “Gazetted Officer with GOI”. She works as some associate in some American bank in biryani city.  After her I went on a dating spree, met almost 5-6 girls. Many of them said one thing for sure, I have a very good heart, and I need to preserve it. 

Would like to know, if anyone had experienced narcissism (NPD) first-hand, what their experiences are. For all it is, a proper mental disorder and people having NPD are the epitome of soul destroying b@t@h.

I was so sure that, at least i would pass with above avg marks. But this; and its not like i have very low marks in all my subjects.

Uh, its so horrible what do i do? How do i plan my next steps? I had filed for a reevaluation in 2nd sem, but i never got any news about that till now, so i have little hopes regarding this too. Can i still give entrance exams for higher studies?

As the title suggests, what do you use to track your hourly Billings and create bills? 
What payment method do you use, and how much %  do they charge for payments into your account? ( I have been thinking of using PayPal, but not very sure about their charges. I read it's 2-3%, but is it at the time of withdrawal to your account, or do they deduct it when the client pays into my payapal, I don't really know how PayPal works TBH.)

I have been using one or those freelancing sites untill now(UW, Fever, Freelancer ) and getting paid through there, but I have clients who I would like to bill outside of those platforms, as they have charges at &gt;20%.

To give you a better picture of my dilemma, say I worked for 20/hour for 5 hours and now the bill is 100 bucks. Client pays that 100 into one of those above-mentioned sites, they deduct their cut and I get 80 bucks. They also charge around $1 for withdrawal, so at the end I get 79. Now that $1 can be saved if you make bulk withdrawals but that's not the point.
I want to minimise that cost and PayPal's 2-3% sounds super awesome compared to what I'm having atm.

Suggestions?? Advice??

PS: I don't need that billing protection etc that the sites provide, my clients are usually great in terms of that.

I took speed tests while inside the house, outside jio seems to be much better but nothing close to Vodafone. 

Questions

1. Is this jio slow down common to all? It's not like we were living a jio dark stop to begin with, it was super fast few months ago. 

2. Is anything blocked on Vodafone or any other caveats I should know of? 

3. How long can I keep the jio sim active(removed from phone) once my current unlimited call and data pack (2gb per day, 448 pack) expires without recharge? 

Reason for this post: until I upgrade my phone, I can only keep one 4G Sim and doesn't wanna be stuck with wrong network for the next 3 months.

I am 29 y/o male who is working in Europe, in a small town, quite a secluded place and I have been living here for 2 years. From the past 1 year my parents have been finding a suitable match for me to get married in India and it has been quite stressful overall in the entire family. I agreed to dwell into this (probably one of my worst decisions as I didn’t make a stable decision upfront) to see and explore whether this actually works or not, but little did I know where my curiosity will lead me to. In the beginning, I have to say that my eagerness was challenged, by that I mean parents constantly sending you photos (there were not a lot) and giving me the phone numbers of women whose gotras or whatever it was matched, with whom eventually I had to talk to. I talked with a couple of women from the past 1 year and I have to say that my experience was not that good. Let my also acknowledge the fact that I am not looking for a something extremely specific (I am not being superficial here as most sensible guys really don’t care a lot about looks these days even though the internet has forced you to) but I was constantly being reminded that this would not work. It didn’t take me a lot of time to realize how flawed this entire system was and how most conversations with women I had involved us discussing how bad this entire system is. 

Now from my parent’s side it was obviously an entire different situation. It was and still is hard to accept to their terms because I feel like this entire thing is a fight towards systematic racism in our country and me being a part of it. By this I mean, my parents trying to find a girl from the same caste, matching the gotras and stars and what not and eventually having a kid from the ‘union’ of 2 people from the same caste such that ‘vamsh ko aage bada sake’. Also, them constantly trying to remind me on how hard this entire “finding” process is and how they struggle everyday with rejections from the families of most women which is gravely embarrassing for them. The thing that they don’t understand is that this has a psychological effect on me as well. When I slightly remind them that this won’t possible work for me, they harass me with depression threats and emotional torture on how bad their upbringing might be due to which I am rejecting most women, how they have to face society, neighbors, ‘char log’ and all. Mind you, I am not on this alone. You might think that my perspective has changed since I am living in Europe. This has nothing to do with where I live as my sister is/was going through the same problem and she is living in India working for an IT company. But she has clearly mentioned to my parents after 2 years of torture from this arranged marriage and meeting weird guys that this thing is not for her and my parents should not bother with this to her again. Now if I follow the same path, my 55+  y/o parents will lose their lives. I have no cousins to talk to regarding this issue as they are either way too older than me and have willingly approved on getting arranged married or they are way too young. I had to constantly keep reminding my parents that if marriage is the biggest problem in our family, then we are actually a privileged family considering a lot of massive real problems what other fames have to go through. I am constantly in a moral dilemma whether I am taking the right steps towards my parents and every time I have to talk to someone and end up in a mutual or a one sided rejection, a part of me keeps dying, not because of the rejection but because I gave them hope that this could work when I subconsciously knew that this wouldn’t and I can’t explain this to my parents. I can’t ask help from my friends over here as they are mostly local Europeans and they don’t understand and plainly laugh at me (not all) when I talk about this.

   * Do I take total loan amount+ amount in personal bank account?

Lately I've been feeling a bit depressed/anxious and have had some trouble sleeping. Alprazolam is a schedule H drug which means you need a prescription for it. I went to like 3-4 different medical shops and all of them refused to sell me any without a prescription. Is there anyway I can get Alprax tablets in India (Mumbai specifically). Is there anyway to get a free prescription somehow as I can't afford a psychiatrist and don't want parents finding out. The large, franchised pharmacies will obviously reject me so I approached smaller, shadier chemists/medical shop but they all demand a prescription (and some don't have any in the first place). I thought given that its India medical shops wouldn't care for prescriptions but somehow they all are demanding it. How do you know which shops to approach, and whether or not they will be open for a bribe?

1559389832,2throwawaythrowaway,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bvk0ap/how_bad_would_gifting_a_smartphone_to_a_teenager/,2,4,,,How bad would gifting a smartphone to a teenager be?,"Hey guys!

I am in a bit of a dilemma and could really use some help from here. My 16 year old cousin passed his 10th class ICSE board exams with flying colors and I asked him what would he like as a gift for his brilliant performance. He asked me for a smartphone (RealMe 3 Pro to be precise. Damn kid XD) . Now I'm in a fix!

I think getting his own personal smartphone at this age is not going to be a good idea. He is a good kid, sincere, motivated and hardworking, and seeing him deteriorate in his 11th and 12th would be really painful. I have seen him around smartphones and trust me, he's a leech! Despite not having his own smartphone, he would be glued to my aunt's or my uncle's (his parents) phones during his 8th and 9th standard. So much that he would remain standing beside the socket while the phone gets charged and he plays his games. There was strictness from his parents during 10th standard and it worked since till 10th, kids are still kids, but I don't think the same can be enforced now. Besides, my aunt-uncle are simple, laid-back pahadi folks who would probably give up after 2-3 explanations/arguments from his side. They wouldn't bug him much. They are not the super educated, urban parents with whom their kids share everything and the parents discuss safe sex/menstruation with them. (Out of context examples??)

I think if his parents remain strict and restrict his usage and specially avoid giving it to him at nights, it would be still okay but such restrictions are hard to do any good to the parent-kid relationship(which is not much in this case) and also, kids are smart at sneaking ;) I used to take my dad's Nokia brick (not even a smartphone LoL) all the time after he fell asleep to chat with my friends when I was in 11th. I am not saying all kids are the same but I hope you get my point.

I understand it all boils down to how sincere the kid is and I am also sure there are many who don't get that distracted and use their phones responsibly. Its just that I don't wanna see my little brother waste his time. Phones are SUPER distracting.

So, what do I do? Any parents here who could monitor their kid's usage and can vouch that phone aren't that bad IF proper supervision is there? Any big brothers/sisters' experiences who gifted their young siblings phones and regretted it? People who got phones after 10th and can give some insight who badly/responsibly they used it? (I didn't get one after 10th. I bought one after entering college after collecting reward money for some months from various relatives for good 12th marks LoL)

PS : Fun conversation from sometime in this January that I remembered. My husband asked him, ""So you also play PUBG like other kids these days?"" ""Na, I don't"" Husband, "" Thats good! Aajkal to sab deewaane hai. (Everyone's crazy these days for it"" ""Yeah, but mummy ke phone me chalta nahi, kaise khelu? (Doesn't work in mom's phone. What do I do?"".

I wanted some feedback/constructive criticism on it. I would be grateful if you could give me some advise too. Thank you.,"We are trying to come up with a database which would include video, audio and written information on crop and agricultural products for farmers. The information would be in Hindi and other regional languages.

For the first phase we are trying to gather information in all media for plant varieties, irrigation, pests, pesticides their usage etc. We have a small team which has started collecting data for each crop from various farmers of our states. 

We hope to have a website where the farmer would click on the crop and get every information he would ever need on the crop at one place. 

The idea was my father’s, he has worked extensively in the agriculture and horticulture sphere, he says this would be helpful for the farmer. We have some agriculturist and some tech folks who are helping us with this. It’s at a very nascent stage and we are using our own money. We want to cap the usage of the website to 2Rupees per month. I have no idea how this would generate revenue but some people in our team are positive that with a large enough user base we could become financially viable. 

The thing is none of us know how to launch this. Do we wait to gather all data for all the sowing season. Convert the information into consumable media and then launch. How would farmers k ow about this? We have a passionate team with some very very old people and I have been kind given the hat of making it work.

If you have any inputs on this I would love to hear them. Thank you.",bvkpoa,,false,/r/india/comments/bvkpoa/i_had_a_startup_idea_i_have_been_working_on_for/,AskIndia

Now, we are building a new, bigger house on our land. We are using every inch of our land. This means the neighbours' windows would be rendered useless as they'll be completely covered. The same people now came to us and requested to leave some margin while we're building. We don't want to leave any of our land.

&amp;#x200B;

So the other party is resorting to verbal abuses &amp; threats. We think they're just trying to invoke a reaction from us, so that they can somehow delay our construction work. We have all the papers of our land and our house, so we are legally in the right. This means they'll not take a legal action and thus I guess they want us to make a mistake (e.g. a physical attack). We want to avoid a legal action as we have had a pathetic experience with the judiciary. But I am just worried they don't do something illegal.

Unfortunately, most of the subreddits are oriented towards the US and Europe.

So I figured I'd ask: any daily/regular use items that are available in India that you feel have been worth the cost and would recommend? Especially if they're reasonably environmentally friendly/sustainable? 

Specific things I've been on the hunt for include:

1. High quality towels
2. Cooking appliances and Utensils
3. Handheld vacuum cleaners

Things I've had recent success with:

1. Bicycle - I bought a low-end single speed bike from Decathlon that's been great to maintain and ride and has been perfect really.
2. Clothing - I've started either buying fabric and getting it stitched, or going to high end sustainable/slow-fashion boutiques like Lila in Delhi. They're a little pricier but they look brilliant and seem to stand the test of time far better than my cheaper clothes
3. Baking tins/tiffins - these are so cheap in India but last forever which is so great.",c34nuy,,false,/r/india/comments/c34nuy/buy_it_for_life_indian_edition/,AskIndia
1561090216,smellsfromauschwitz,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c35wxa/im_really_lost/,30,84,,,I'm really lost.,"I failed 10th back in 2011 and stopped studying for 3 years straight before realizing that 10th fail will not get me anywhere.

My father always asked me if I wanna live like this forever or will go out and find work and I always said ""who'd hire a 10th failed?"".

In 2013, however, I gave 10th exam again and this time I passed with 48% (it's nothing but it's still better than being 10th fail)

But by that time I had lost all interest toward studying any farther and stayed at home without working for a year untill 2015, when two friend of mine went to Kolkata to work for a call center where's only requirement is English (and I had it). so, upon their next visit home, I went with them to KOLKATA.

But there was something I didn't know neither my *own* friends cared to tell me about the job. It was a fucking scam company who phish on old British people. I got moral issue so couldn't work there for more than a month and came back home to eat off of my father again. This goes on for another two years until my father's sudden death in 2017. It shattered my family (My mother and Sister is my only family).

We don't have a house, we lived in a government quarter because my father was an agriculture employee but now we've been asked to live the quarter because my father doesn't work for them anymore.

I could get my father's job had the compassionate ground scheme weren't changed into compassionate family pension scheme on april 1st 2016.

we got nearly 18 something lakh rupees from agriculture but with it we have to build a house and my sister is unmarried so I cannot ask money to start something of my own, not because we have less money but because I don't have any fucking experience with anything, let alone starting a business.

Now I'm facing the real problem, I do not have any skills. any job requires skill.

I'm 23 years old with a 10th pass certificate and zero skill on my hands. I'm feeling so worthless because I don't know what I wan't to do; what are my interest, what kind of work I can do. I don't know anything.

I've been contemplating suicide lately but I don't wanna leave my mother and sister in this position.

I'm caught between wanting to just marry my girlfriend and the incredible guilt I feel from watching my parents cry.

We'd do it in a bathroom stall over there. Any advice is appreciated. For more details and context, please read underneath.

&amp;#x200B;

Throwaway account, for, reasons you may understand.

So, I have a girlfriend studying in FIITJEE South Delhi, and, her parents don't know about the relationship, but mine do, and they don't have much of a problem. I have my birthday coming in a few weeks, so, my dad's actually going to Spain for work on the day of my birthday, and the closest airport is in Delhi, so, he'd go there anyway, so, he asked if I wanted to come and spend the afternoon with my girlfriend.

Of course, I agreed, and, well, we talk a little bit at night almost everyday on the phone. She purposefully chose one of those keypad type feature phones, so as to not distract her from her studies. Anyway, since we used to talk everyday, my dad will basically drop me near her hostel, and then go to the airport. Of course, he'll send the car back, so when I'm done the car would take me home.

So, me and my girlfriend talk everyday anyway, so, I made a plan for the day that we'd go for lunch and then maybe make out some. Or, we won't get to see each other a lot this year, since I'm incredibly busy with my studies too, so, we'd possibly just make out the whole time lol. Anyway, of course, India being India, can't really kiss in public, the best place I could find near the Kalu Sarai place is a mall called Crescent mall. It's about 3 km from the South Delhi hostel, about 10-15 minutes by auto. She said there are autos near her hostel, so, I'm hoping one goes there. And even if it doesn't, there's always stuff like Ola and Uber.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, the maximum time she can be out of her PG without any suspicions is 2 hours, so, we'll make do in that time only. So, yeah, give me your opinions. If it's a good plan or not, and if there are any better places nearby that don't take a lot of time to get to. And if any one has been to Crescent mall, and has toured the inside, how is the place? We basically plan to get inside a bathroom stall in the mall and do our thing, but, if anyone has better ideas, do enlighten me. Even if any one of you lives near Crescent mall, if you could go and check out the washrooms for me, it'd be an incredible help.

&amp;#x200B;

To the few people who may feel concerned about my behaviour, me and my girlfriend are both 16, we're both mature and responsible people, and we have made out before a few times. Me and my girlfriend used to live quite far away, and her parents didn't really let her leave the house, so, before we only used to meet in school, and were able to make out a few times in there.

My dad gave them on rent since last 10-12 years to one family who lives in that village . But now they are not willing to release our land as we wanted to give the farm to another person for farming . He ( Prime member of family *elder son )  is forcing us to continue with the present condition and even not paying us rent for land and  for the crops. Since last 1-2 years he has became criminal as he is mining sand illegally , basically runs a "" Sand mining mafia "" network , what should we do? Is there anyone in here can give legal advice . Although he talks like he doesn't care about legal action and tell us that what will you do by complaining as he has already several case pending against him in court for beating up the govt officials. 
Only condition he gave us to wait for another 1 year until he fetches out the present sugarcane in the farm and he will release the farm , but I think he might be bluffing just to postponing it.

Kindly give me legal advice about it or mention any legal advice page present on reddit . Thanks.

My girlfriend and I will be in India for about ten days and we love train travel so we had the idea of taking trains whenever possible and two of these would be night trains. Imagine our surprise when 3 hours later we have had numerous failed attempts with a solution nowhere in sight. What do we do?

&amp;#x200B;

Do we need an account linked to an indian #? Should we just buy tickets in person at the station? (not ideal for planning)

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks everyone!

Edit: if anyone would purchase or allow me to use your account to purchase I would give you 10% on top of our ticket cost. I know there are other ways to see the country but my field of study is pretty relevant to trains and it's my favorite way to travel. Let me know if you can help!

Edit 2: Cleartrip.com ended up working for us. The only luck we had booking was on this site. Highly recommend it. Was suggested by a redditor here. Appreciate the help everyone!",bvwlk5,,false,/r/india/comments/bvwlk5/irctc_train_ticket_problems/,AskIndia

Please help with India itinerary!,"My mom and little brother will come visit me on my extended solo trip through India. We will have about two weeks together, of which one we will spend in Delhi (long time I know, but this can´t be changed).
The remaining time we will go to Shimla for two or three nights, Vrindavan for one night, and either Jaipur or Gwalior for three nights - but which one of these two?

I recommended Jaipur (been there before), my mom said she doesn´t want it to be too touristy. She found some pics of Gwalior online and wants to go there instead. I fear that other than the fort, there won´t be much to do in Gwalior. Also I´m not sure whether it´s actually good to go to Gwalior just because there will be less tourists - maybe that is a disadvantage ( re. accomodation, transport, places to eat, and general acceptance of tourists). I have seen that Orchha could be an interesting day trip from Gwalior though.

So, what would you recommend - Jaipur or Gwalior?

Everyone hates him, but no one says anything. He is 18 , breaks things in the house, demands everything from new bikes and cars to money. He is making our life horrible and I'm sure there is nothing going to be left when me and my younger sister come for any help required. 
 Parents don't say him anything . Just keep on supplying money. I don't talk to him for past reasons but that I've finally stopped because that's became another headache for my parents.
Sister pretends to like him because she is scared.



And I just want to kill him. I'm making this post because I just found out that he took my parents box of money from locker and ran away (3 days ago) but came after when my father threatened him that he will call the cops. Currently he is asking money to buy a new bike. He is a kind of asshole where if you buy him something, he gets bored of it and will ask for the most expensive thing. He leaves home at midnight and I  don't know what he does, comes at 5 or something and sleeps till 12pm. He is borderline pass from his 10th to 12th and is now refusing to do and course for jobs. 
 I am very scared and depressed because if all this. My parents just hit 50 and may get a heart attack because of all this anytime. 
 I left all my playing or anything physical for my 12 preparation for NEET ( I'm currently in 12th) .

I was suddenly notified that my previous payment was pending and i needed to pay that before continuing. I checked my account balance again and saw that the money had already been deducted from my account. I reached out to Uber and informed them about my situation, with screenshots of my account statement and messages from my bank regarding the amount debited. They replied in a few hours, saying that on their side, this was registered as an unsuccessful charge and therefore I would have to pay to continue. I sent them the documents again, asking why I would have to pay when my money had already been deducted. They didn't reply after that, despite numerous emails and in-app messages from my side. My problem is not that the amount is so high that i cant afford it. 600 rs is obviously not a big deal. My problem is that this reckless behaviour towards consumers is incredibly irresponsible on Ubers part. Charging its users double for their rides is definitely an unethical practice, and the fact that they refuse to address grievances by customers makes this even worse.

Bidet all the way, all my life. My girlfriend is the opposite - 100% relies on TP. 

I live with my girlfriend, and we divide almost every household thing 50/50. Stuff like groceries, bills, bedsheets etc. But we do have some things that only one of us uses or requires. Whey Protein for me - make up and bodycare stuff for her. 

Now we usually buy these separate things ourselves but this weekend, she wasn't feeling well and we were out of TP, so I went to buy it for her. She told me to get a 4-ply one. Never having bought it before, imagine my surprise when 4 rolls of 4-ply of basically thin paper cost Rs 360. Now, we both work and both have comfortable salaries, but I couldn't help and say it to her how expensive this paper stuff was. Again, it was not coming from a bad place - I was just saying it, I was thinking I would never pay that much for a roll of paper - flawed thinking I know - it's her purchase (and I for my part pay 6k for the whey every month), but I just made a little comment. Long story short we had a little fight which came down to why does she even use TP and how I find it disgusting, but I realized that I was in the wrong here. Apparently it is more hygienic for women.

In this post, by civil servants I mostly mean the glamorous posts like collectors and IPS officers. But it is applicable to other posts too.

Some people say civil servants like collectors and IPS officers can make a great deal of changes. But they're ability to make changes is limited to only very few areas. If a person like a collector or an IPS is to move against a minister or a politician or a wealthy businessman, then it is most probably sure that he/she will have a tough time. Probably he/she will be suspended or transferred.

As India is a democracy the elected representatives have more power over the executionaries of which civil servants are a part. Besides politicians have the support of the masses in many cases and they bend the laws using their power.

Waste management, traffic etc are some of the areas in which civil servants can make changes. These are areas in which ministers and politicians do not interfere much.

Many collectors and IPS officers are puppets under politicians. Even if a politician gets behind the bars, he/she would be getting preferential treatment in there.

Civil service is glamorous only because of the salary and benefits and respect one gets from being in that position. I don't understand why people are going after it still if they want to have real freedom and power. Just getting money won't give us enough freedom. Of course. There are those civil servants who are highly corrupted. But then even they are just puppets under the politicians.

My family faced a lot of shaming for this and with a lot of risk, I repeated a year. Today was my Part 2 (2nd year repeater) exam, and I did extremely bad (couldn't even attempt 30 marks) and I am about to fail.

The system is, that if I get more than 40% I can continue with Honors, but my marks at the end of graduation will be extremely low (about 40-50%). And if I get more than 35% but less than 40%, I can continue to third year, but with as a general student, i.e., no specialization in Physics.

If I get less than 35%, I will fail and will have to repeat a year, which my dad will not accept (actually, he can't afford it, we are poor and my dad is desperate for me to complete my graduation).

I don't know what to do. The results will be out in November. And before that, I have to make a decision. Is there any prospect at all for people who do really bad in graduation exam?

There's this new app called Cred where you can make payment for your credit cards, and it rewards you with some points and goodies that can be claimed against them. Recently a friend referred me to the platform and I installed the app.

On a first glance, the app looks brilliant. A testament to what a proper UX flow should be, with a simplified option to manage your cards and make payments. So, I've gone ahead and made a payment which should reflect in some time. Now, on a hunch, I checked the app reviews and they are absolutely horrible. You can scroll through pages after pages and won't even find a 2 star rating for the app. And all this is giving me an uneasy feeling.

The app is made by the freecharge team, so I kind of trusted it but now feeling a bit unwary. So, have any of you used this app? How credible and fast is the process of payments? Honestly, I don't care much about the rewards but was drawn towards the ability to pay credit card bills using upi from a single platform. So, please let me know your experiences with this app.",by01iz,,false,/r/india/comments/by01iz/any_feedback_about_the_cred_app/,AskIndia

I'm very glad to visit the Official Subreddit for India! I'm here to learn more about Indian English.

Braj Kachru was an Indian linguist who initiated, shaped and defined the field of World Englishes- the study about varieties of English language,  and published several books and research papers related to the field. One of the fundamental statements of this theory is that ""all varieties are equal to each other as they represent unique  linguocultural identities all over the world"" and that ""a native English speaker is not necessarily a person who was ""born"" with English language and acquired it in early childhood in an English-speaking environment"". 

In this connection I would like to find out: Do you agree with these statements? What's the real status and importance of English in India? Has it really transformed into Indian English variety or it still follows British norms? What else can you say about English in India and in the world?

But with the current state of affairs and over the past few years, we all know that states in the US have been legalizing marijuana, rapidly. And also legal in Canada country wide.

So there's really no basis for keeping it criminalized now, just cause it has been criminalized for the past few decades.

Personally, I believe it should be legal. Grandma's experience is always good. When we've been a society traditionally accepting of Cannabis, we shouldn't have banned it in the first place. It is *not* a synthetic drug. It is completely natural. I think it is time the legislation is reversed. We must take back what is ours. 

The arguments on the lines of ""hey everybody will stop going to work and go high on weed"" are BS. Cigarettes are legal. You don't see people smoking their lungs out. 

Control is necessary but it is about *self* not the fucking government controlling perfectly natural, non lethal, nirvana inducing diamonds.

I am open to criticism but don't take BS.

Edit1: It is a medicine.
Helpful in headache.
Anxiety
Fever
Painkiller (better than paracetamol)
And is used as an anaesthetic in Ayurveda.

It is a plant. It is not a chemical narcotic. It was banned under the adept lobbying by the American and European pharmaceutical giants. India under Rajiv Gandhi succumbed under international pressure and passed legislation to ban it in India in 1985.

Of course... Every thing needs to be taken in controlled quantities, though. I don't support banning. The US states where it has been legalized have shown a decrease in headache/fever and other small drug sales. This is the reason the pharmaceuticals don't want it to be legal. They extract the properties of cannabis to use in medicines then sell them to us at high prices. This is a conspiracy.

These were this colorful pieces of work, we used to collect together, share among ourselves, and to be fare made life a different somehow. They filled up our imaginations, and was the topic of discussion among most of our classmates. Remember, these were pre-internet times, and cable TV came to our households in the later part of the decade.

This might just be the nostalgia speaking, but they were an universe of their own. Nagraj, the man with the powers to shape-shifting and powers of a snake; Parmanu, Indian Ant-man in some way; Doga, our way of having a Batman, with a touch of Punisher. These were all under Raj comics. Then there was Chacha Chaudhary, a totally different species. Forgive me of leaving so many out, as it not possible to name them all.

The thing is, almost all of us go gaga about the next Marvel movie (there are some for the DC ones as well ), but most of use shrug of these Indian superheros as a joke. I agree that some (maybe most) of these comics may have had absurd stories, and the characters similarly absurd stories, but so does the Marvel and DC ones (not trying to point fingers).

Recently Anurag Kashyap attempted in making a Doga movie, but canned it; Raj comics have been trying the same, although the attempts made were abysmal in my opinion. In the recent times we had a few movies which are similar in some sorts, ""Mard ko Dard Nahi Hota"", ""Bhavesh Joshi Superhero"", I am not putting the details as they might be spoilers. I am not saying that they are great movies, but they are quite good attempts in this genre.

So here is my question, are our Indian superheros are relic of the past, of they are going to die a slow death in obscurity? In personal viewpoint, I want them to re-emerge, as a superhero re-emerges after a defeat in the hands of the villain, to fight back again. Maybe they need new writers, artists who can take them to a new level, I do not know what they need. I personally would want this experience to be passed down to our next generation, and enjoy it while we are at it.

I'm from Brazil and I live in a medium city, with 200k people. I have a friend from Jaipur, we talk for a long time and he sent a lot of videos of his trips around India and that just makes me wanna visit that country even more. Anyway one of the things I'm most curious about is how the traffic works there! And just cheking his videos and the videos from internet I just get amazed and scared how much times the drivers there use the horn sound while are driving!  I'm a driver for one half year and I think I dont used the car horn more than 10 times in my whole life.

&amp;#x200B;

If someone uses the horn here I just get freaking scared, cause that means an accident is about to happen, or something really serious, like a small kid accrosing the street which the drivers around may cant see. The point is, if someone use the car horn in the traffic here is hard to understand what that means in the exactly moment, is hard to see who is using the horn and even hard to get what that driver wanna to say with that horn sound. For us just like a warning, like ""hey pay attention!"" or ""hey be careful!""

I own a restaurant that receives orders on Swiggy, Zomato, Dunzo and other online platforms. Due to the aggregator restrictions, I can only receive and display orders in my restaurant in English. However, my staff cannot read English and is unable to process orders until someone reads it out to them.

I tried the Google translate plugin, but it's only about 60% accurate and it's unable to translate some specific terms like ""Sriracha"" or ""Chipotle"" and absolutely butchers other terms like ""pizza pockets"" or ""hot dog"". I also cannot customise the output of the plugin

What I'm looking for is a way to transliterate the words phonetically for each menu item. So, for example, ""burger"" should display as ""बर्गर"" and ""hot dog"" should display as ""हॉट डॉग"".

This will allow my staff to read the items and prepare the order without intervention from English speakers. The order page interface is also dynamic, and new orders need to be transliterated as they come in. The Google translate plugin automatically translates new orders, but again it's terribly inaccurate.

Would really appreciate any help from you guys on this. I'm sure many other restaurants face similar problems and require a similar solution. Thanks in advance.",c2xx4i,,false,/r/india/comments/c2xx4i/how_do_i_transliterate_a_dynamic_page_from/,AskIndia

I have a horrible hair style, and i have zero ability to tell what i want or what would look on me.

Couple of years back i had an actual hair stylist that i'd just go to and sit down, i wouldn't even say a single word, and he'd give me amazing haircut.

But he left cut and style and again i went on the search for a good hair stylist.

Cue a year of horrible haircuts or not even getting a haircut to avoid that pain.

What i'm looking for is a genuine hair stylist who is actually trained and knows what he is doing, not what i get at those chain salons with the ever changing staff and people who just keep cutting one strand and asking is this good.

Someone who knows English since i don't know Hindi who'd be able to simply tell me what would look good on me.

Many times when i go for a hair cut, i choose one from the net having no idea if it will suit my facial structure or my hair type, and the barber would try to imitate it and fail, while every second asking me if he's doing good, i mean how am i supposed to know, have some confidence in your skill man.

Sorry that this has turned into a rant, but this issue has been bothering me for sometime.

Scored above 85 in 10th and 12th.

Got Wipro on the first day when it came to campus. Since, then I have tried everything, sat for placement in every company that is not a mass recruiter, gave CAT and XAT secured 90 percentile in both, but couldn't secured anything beyond wipro. 

I also tried applying off campus, but was rejected by companies incl Shell, Honeywell etc. 

Gave e litmus, co cubes scored 80 in both. Got shortlisted for some but couldn't secured anything. 

My Wipro joining is on the 19th June in Pune, with formal joining on 24th June. 

I was elated when I read that wipro usually give late joining to it's freshers and thought it is a good time to prepare for cat and other exams, but the joining came yesterday for June 19th.

I am stuck in an corner, tried everything that I could to avoid this. 
Gave my blood and sweat into everything. 
But, Got Nothing. 

People I know are saying, *Wipro mil gaya, aur kya lega*.
They are saying I should Join Wipro and gain experience, and I should only focus on learning how much I can, also I will get good start from wipro, because Wipro is a brand. 

My counter question is that if Mass recruiters provided a good learning exp, then why are people frustrated after working for an year in these companies and look to get out? 

I also applied for a tech based fellowship being conducted by Plaksha Tech university and awaiting it's results.

My aim is to work in finance, but it goes through the route of CAT and I will surely give it this year. 

Inshort, I am so hopeless with my life that I am clinging on the 'e' in hope. 


What should I do?

For that, I am looking for help from people who have done similar work or who have experience of any kind in the field of opening up a school.   


Some of the questions to which I am looking for answers:  


1. How much of investment does it take (approx.) to open up a play-school and/or primary school in a Tier-2 city? Which part of building a school will require major part of the capital? What is the average teacher salary there?
2. How good is the support from government if I plan to build a school on a leased property- I mean, does the government provide any kind of support financially/legally for it?
3. Why do most of the schools are located outside the city? Is there a reason for it, like the government restrictions,  or is it just a coincidence?

  
It would be really helpful if you could share your experiences or if your inputs to go about this plan in a better way?

1) is there any other alternative to these three out there?  
2) drivezy has a few weird wordings for example, if i take the car with fuel they say they will reimburse the fuel if i show them the receipt, which is legit. but they add reimbursement will be on fair usage basis. another vague wording they have used if i take the car without fuel then they will charge a fixed cost and plus a nominal charge for the km the car has travelled.

Some self assessment tells me that I can either take a gap until the MBA exams this year, and prepare religiously for 6 hours a day, or take up the job and study for 2 hours a day, and very easily at least make it to a good B School for the batch beginning in 2021. 
I don't think I'd be too old for graduating out of b school at that age, and I think it would also equip me with some street smarts on how to live/get things done independently.

So, to give context, of all metropolitan cities in India ; Delhi, Bombay, Bangalore, Chennai are very morbid cities.

Water scarcity, urban congestion, pollution related hazards and traffic are a few issues contributing to morbidity in cities.

The paradoxical situation in a city is; though there are avenues for leading a high quality standard of life Eg Access to Clubs, Discotheques, Theaters, Cultural and Sporting events etc, the residents are restricted from pursuing these interests and passions for a pleothra of reasons like mentioned above. 

It is evident that there is a tradeoff between quality of life and avenues and accessibility to a better standard of life. 
Which are the cities in India, that has relatively high quality of life but the corresponding sacrifice in standard of life is marginal?

That husbands have suppressed their dreams and careers because of usually pregnancy or whatever other damn reason. And there is no way they can be helped out the rabbit hole they have stepped in. This doesn't place itself just in the case women not having to pursue careers, but in general women don't even participate in discussions of real interest.

&amp;#x200B;

I am an OCI/Expat living in Gurugram.  I find myself with quite a bit of time on my hands and I want to organize some garbage clean-up events in the area.  I can get the people and the supplies, I just cannot seem to figure out how to dispose of the waste once collected.  Most of the services I am coming across will only accept recyclables and not the actual waste.  Does anyone know of a service that will come and pick up garbage if it has been bagged/collected?  I am specifically referring to open fields/side of the road type of things, not at a residence.

I have been preparing for SSC for the past two years, but the government process is really slow. Gave the Exam in 2017 and the process is still going on. I am not sure if I am going to make it this time and if I give the exam this year it will take around 2 years again. Meanwhile, I started a small YouTube channel and getting a decent response, recently crossed the 1000 Subscribers mark. Now I have not earned anything from it yet but I believe that I'll be able to. Which made me think that I need an outside opinion, not Family not Friends But random people who will be actually seeing my videos. 

The video creation process is very Time Consuming but I enjoy doing it. As of now, I have been studying and creating these videos but now I was thinking about pursuing it full time. 

If this were just an idea, it would have been hard for you people to judge and tell me but I have 6 videos on my channel for you all to judge my work. 

The videos I create are sort of Animated, in Hindi and 3 to 6 min long. Inspired by Ted, CGP Grey, etc.

Here's a link to a short one (3 min) so it won't take much of your time.

My first name is Tanmay

FN - father's name

SN - Surname

So my name on 10th Board certificate is SN - Tanmay - FN in that order. It's a thing in Maharashtra where the official name is usually in that order.

Currently I'm in 3rd year of my B Tech from some Delhi college. And everyone here calls me Mr. FN (My father's name), at least in official settings as it's at the end of my full name. They assume it's my last name. And my father's name is really old school (think something like Gajanan or Ramgopal). It's kinda embarrassing. They expect some uncle and when I raise my hand they're surprised to see a 21 year old dude. It has become a joke between my friends too.

If I can change the order of my name on my 10th certificate, I can easily get it changed here in my college and my degree certificate. I want to apply for MBA next year and I really don't want everyone to call Mr. Gajanan.

So is there a way to get it changed on my 10th certificate? Has anyone tried anything similar? There must be others with the same problem as it's quite common in Maharashtra. Most people probably don't care.

Also my name on Aadhar card and Pan card is simply Tanmay-Surname, if that's relevant. When I apply for passport next year, does that require 10th certificate too? Genuine question. What if I apply for Visa in the future? And higher education abroad? If I couldn't change the name, how likely is that the discrepancy between name on degree certificate and official ID is going to affect me adversely?

TL;DR: Want to change the order of my name in 10th Maharashtra board passing certificate. Name is slightly different on Aadhar card.

I gave her Rs.50 and she wanted to 'bless' me and asked to lower the window a bit further, there were 2 other hijras with her, I got a bit suspicious.  

I lowered the window and she touched the steering and prayed something, then asked for Re.1 coin, I took out my wallet and gave her the coin, she blessed the coin and wanted to put it back in my wallet, I had around Rs.1500 in various denominations in my wallet, she saw this and grabbed it saying she'll bless this also, but I held on to the notes firmly and said there's no need for that, she didn't let go until I said no a few times, she let go cussing me while walking away. 

Now I'm not sure if this is normal or an attempt to run away with money, btw this happened in Chennai.",bwrlmc,,false,/r/india/comments/bwrlmc/had_a_weird_experience_not_sure_if_it_was_an/,AskIndia

I want to move to something more sustainable. 
What are the things I can shift to completely ?

Hemp? Organic cotton? Khadi?

Do you know of something or someplace I can buy them? Simple t-shirts and trousers.

Hi all,

I need some advices/ suggestions.

My mom is having an issue with her mental health - following some traumatic experience from her childhood. Not violent but she is not able to forget them and she is reliving those moments on a daily basis. Imagine going through hellish events every day for last 45+ years!.

It messes her life so badly. she recognizes it sometimes and will ask us to take her to any psychiatrist and psychologists, but she will change her mind soon after that. We tried different medications and counsellings but nothing worked for long. Until recently we all managed to live our life without much trouble, but from last two years things are getting verse, doing strange things which i cannot explain here and started talking to almost everyone some imaginative stories but soon forgets about that. For someone outside she is perfectly normal and they are getting confused.

We are looking for some mental health improving centers,  or someplaces where she can stay for a bit - maybe a month or two - and get help, but not the normal mental hospitals please. We don't want her to be in a place with any violent patients. Even if it pains us all to take this decision, doctors advised us to take this step, so we want her to have the best care available. Preferably in Kerala.

I am a Bengali, was born and have been raised in Park Circus, Kolkata.

A string of numbers and letters have appeared on the wall with the main door. And not just our apartment.

If yes, how tf can anyone enter someone's residential building and deface walls (exactly what it is) overnight?

Here it is: H8X8+7NKK [lots of spaces] 2E [lots of spaces] 795

I believe the above string will not identify any particular house, much less mine or my neighbours'.

It is unclear to us if this ""VPK"" is an actual name, or instead some kind of post-nominal abbreviation. (In the manner of ""Jr."", for example.)

""VPK"" already seems unlikely as **any** name, since it has no vowels (How would it be pronounced), but is also much shorter than most other Indian names I have ever encountered. I have a hard time believing this is someone's name.

It seems more likely to me that it's some kind of abbreviation, but after spending a lot of time trying to find out, I'm at a loss. It might even be a special Indian or South Asian legal expression, perhaps indicating marital or other status.

1. The video is some old production of Ramayana. The scenes starts with ram and Laxman coming across the duel between Sugreev and Bali. Sugreev gets beat up and escapes. Scene then switches to Bali getting bandaged with ram and Laxman on either side.

2. Scene dubs samples(I'm not kidding):

a) Bali and Sugreev with their fists locked each trying to overpower each other. Bali says: bhauuusadike.

b) Sugreev and bali slinging their maces. 
Sugreev: kya kar lega tu?
Bali: main teri maa chod dunga.
Sugreev: tu meri maa chodega? Nahi chodega nahi chodega.

C) Sugreev running away. 
Bali: daud gaya laude se.

D) bali hitting Sugreev with interlocked fists.
Bali: le dishum bhausadike 

I'll try add more as I remember them.

I'm absolutely serious about this.",c645fc,,true,/r/india/comments/c645fc/ask_india_tip_of_my_tonguensfw_im_looking_for_a/,AskIndia

I've been travelling India for quite a while now. Everyday, without fail, when I walk on the streets or go anywhere, some people will look at me then talk amongst themselves about me (I assume, and I say assume, because I am not certain for sure - maybe this is just me overthinking). I'll always hear 'China' which I assume is referring to me.

I get that it's fascinating for some to see someone different. I just wanted to know the feelings behind those reactions (or your reactions in this case). Are most people fascinated, curious, or generally feel that the Chinese are weird? (and why?)

I absolutely love it when people personally come up to ask me where I'm from. I've had a few of these encounters and it absolutely warms my heart. Most recently, a mum told me her kid wanted to know where I was from - and she wished me happy travels!

Throwaway account becuase this is something which has been bugging me for quite some time tbh,sorry for the bad formatting as i am on mobile. So i am 24 Year old male and i used to very ugly till about 18 years old age and the girls used to treat me like shit even the ugly ones all i wanted was a single girl to like me of my level around a 4 or something but this was not supposed to be girls used to call me ugly and disgusting basically they treated me like shit and i thought of commiting suicide due to the harsh treatment . Then i went on improving my looks and physique after 2 years of working out and taking steroids (i still take them ) i had developed a good physique and thought girls would take interest in me now but there was no improvement sadly.

Then i looked into plastic surgery(i come from a decent household) and long story short i got rhino and chin and jaw implants which costed me a lot but i convinced my parents by saying it was your fault that i am ugly becuase you are both ugly and still decided to have a kid. At this point i was 21 years old and completely a changed.man and i am 5.10""ft tall and weigh 170 lbs at about 10 percent bodyfat. I was still a virgin at 21 and thought about continiung my education becuase for the past 3 years i did not nothing but increase my looks. So i went to adifferent state and enrolled in a different medical private college and also installed tinder on my phone.Now i was a 8 out of 10 due to ppastic surgery on my face and it improved my facial features a lot. And now it has been 3 years since and i have fucked around 25+ girls from my college and tinder and tbh i wanted to take revenge on them for treating me like shit i would tell the girls that i wanted a long term relationship with them but i would fuck them for about a month or so and then cheat or breakup saying we are not sexually compatible or some other reason. The thing that surprised me most was girls knew what was i doing with them and still continued to give me a chnace. I thought after fucking lots of girls i would be fine but i cannot stop now i have become addicted to treating them like shit bcuz they did the same to me and i cannot stop. I also think i am so hurt at how i was treated that i cannot fall in love ever so what should i do ?Please help as i am still not satisfied and i tell all girls i want a realtio ship but i just fuck them for a month or so and then onto the next and the cycle continues.. Should.i see a therapist or what? I am glad i had plastic surgery becuase i know now looks are that all that matters no persnality no money no nothing !!",c6649g,,false,/r/india/comments/c6649g/please_help_urgent_advice_neededi_am_a_very_bad/,AskIndia

Not to mention that most of the agents so far do not seem to have any sort of credibility as far as I can see and are likely to steal money. My parents, however, are adamant on somehow getting to the US. They think that life there will be easy and stress-free.

There have been countless arguments so far where I hoped to get them to rethink the decision but none have worked.

I’m in Canada currently and the general career path is to start at the very bottom as a production assistant and then on to assistant editor for 5-7 years and then if you play your cards right maybe they’ll give you a shot at editing.

I wanted to know the Indian process...how people start their careers. Bollywood’s a lot bigger than the Canadian film industry and of course I’d like to work in as big a place as I can.

So basically my questions briefly...

1) Is the Indian process the same as the Canadian process I’ve explained above? Will that mean if I move back to Bombay I’ll have to start with that entry level job again just to network? 

2) if I make a portfolio of my editing work what do I do with it in India? Like who’s going to look at it when there’s so many Indians sending theirs in? Is foreign education/ work experience an advantage?

Who do I even send it to?

3) how have others done it? What’s the general path (not necessarily in post production)

4) question for those with experience in this field.....should I strictly focus on ONE department like video editing or should I learn a bit of everything like Motion graphics, colour grading, a little green screen, sound mixing.

Is it looked down upon to be a jack of all trades as opposed to being a specialist in one department? Or is it preferred?

Thanks to anyone who’s answered! I won’t be replying for a few hours coz I have to get up for work but I’ll love reading replies in the morning.",bz8g4m,,false,/r/india/comments/bz8g4m/how_would_someone_with_no_connections_get_into/,AskIndia

After my nephew was 6 months old, we came to know that his one eye is damaged. 

Now from last 2.5 years, he is undergoing treatment in AIIMS, Delhi. His condition has only deteriorated. He doesn’t have vision in one eye, optic nerves are damaged and pressure in eye is 40. There have been 2 operations to control pressure and 2 retina change but now doctors have given up saying they have done what they could. His eye has turned white due to glaucoma and is bulging outwards due to high pressure. Doctors told they may have to remove the eye once he is 10-12 year old.

My sister now stays with my parents in Panipat. From last 2.5 years she has seen his condition worsening with every passing day. She has no career. She stays at house all day. My parents are supportive but sometimes they also cry on their destiny. Sometimes they say cuss words for child.

There is lot of weeping and overall mood of house is depressed. 

Only I know that she gets suicidal thoughts. She says she will kill her son and herself. She thinks why all this happened with her.

I needed some advice from Indian expats/students living in one of these countries.

I'm aiming for a master's in aerospace/automobile or management of technology (TU Delft/ TU Munich/ McGill) with aim of settling down/staying.

Which country should I finalize? I can speak English and Hindi, and I'm willing to learn Dutch. I have cleared A levels in German but from all my research I've concluded that Western Europe will only be willing to let me into their universities but they won't offer me jobs, won't take me in, won't let me integrate into their countries as easily as Canada would.
Apparently, the job market also seems to be biased against non EU skilled STEM students as well. 

It was my dream to live and settle in Europe but the reality seems to be that Europe doesn't want many Indians there, and jobs are only given if there isn't any EU member available for that role; considering all of these aspects, should I aim for Canada or Netherlands/Germany?",bzay1g,,false,/r/india/comments/bzay1g/choosing_between_canada_or_western_europe_for/,AskIndia

Some time ago I had a spat with my wife when she was pregnant.

Thereafter, we patched up things and I visited her several times in Bangalore and everything was fine. I also moved to Bangalore from Delhi to support my upcoming family. Later after delivery of my child, my in-laws started conspiring against me again and when my mother (only immediate relative I have) visited to see my baby, they had an ugly social spat with us over a pointless issue. Dejected, I shifted back to Delhi and I and my wife limited our conversations to WhatApp and phone. I visited Bangalore yesterday after 6 weeks of baby delivery to get my baby immunized. My wife has taken this chance to further alienate me from the baby and picked up another pointless fight on WhatsApp. She abused me and my family and started harassing me and now is threatening me with a obviously false dowry harrasment / 498a case. I am alone in Bangalore without immediate family support and am scared if they will act tomorrow against me.

Its a story set in the tumultuous days just before the breakup of Yugoslavia and the wars and genocides that followed after. The book details how Slobodan Milosevic and other Serbian ultra-nationalists unleash a campaign of fear and hatred towards other ethnicities in Yugoslavia. 

He whipped up passions of Serbians living in Bosnia, Croatia and Kosovo and claimed they were under attack from the other ethnicities. 

He demonized the Bosniaks and reduced them to a purely Muslim identity so that they could be tagged as outsiders despite hundreds of years of shared history with other ethnicities in Bosnia and a complex identity with which they viewed themselves. Bosniak Muslims were also pejoratively referred to as Turks, meaning that because they were muslim their allegiance lay to the nearest Muslim country.

He had an associate who controlled Belgrade TV network and inflamed passions with fiery, racist and misleading content played again and again. 

When a Serbian soldier was killed along with other ethnicities by an Albanian soldier, Milosevic's stooges arranged for a large public funeral for the soldier even against the wishes of the soldier's parents. They used this occasion to spew further venom against other ethnic groups.

When Milosevic went to Kosovo to address incidents of violence there, a large contingent of Serbs showed up, transported there mysteriously, in a massive show of strength even though their actual population in Kosovo was less than 10%. He used the occasion to repeat that Serbs were being attacked and killed in Kosovo even though news reporters couldn't corroborate any of the incidents he was talking about.

Milosevic was a powerful orator and had loyal support among most of the Serbs. Liberal Serbs were clamped down upon during his regime.

Serbs detested the long rule of Josef Tito, who for all his flaws, stressed on unity amongst the various ethnic groups and suppressed Serbian nationalism. With Milosevic's rise to power, Serbs saw an opportunity to gain back what they thought was denied to them under Tito.

Eventually the Yugoslav National Army was ordered to attack its own people including the Slovenians, Croats and Bosniaks. These ethnicities deserted the army and it became an Army only of Serbs distrusted throughout the republic. In many places it became a war between the local police force and the Yugoslav army.

There were many such incidents detailed in the book and I was quite surprised to see that I could make out parallels with what we have seen in India in the past and present. When we talk of fascists in India, we often draw comparisons to Hitler and Nazi Germany. But in many ways I found Yugoslavia to be a closer parallel considering it too was a republic with a diverse population mix. It had similar problems with respect to ethnic and language nationalism, federal division of powers leading to political conflict and a well functioning economy that all unravelled in the years of conflict from the 90s. 

Would highly recommend people to read this book just to understand how it all went down in Yugoslavia. I hope India and other nations learn from such experiences.",c4648f,,false,/r/india/comments/c4648f/learning_from_history_yugoslavias_descent_into/,Politics

https://indianexpress.com/article/india/terror-biggest-threat-global-summit-leaders-combat-pm-modi-maldives-china-indian-ocean-5771550/

And it seemed odd that Modi compared terrorism to climate change. My gut says that climate change is a much larger threat than terrorism, but how do the number of people who are affected by both actually compare? If you look at the number of floods, draughts and famines caused by climate change, and see how many people are affected by that and compare that to the number of people affected by terrorist activities, are the two close? Doesn't feel like they would be, but I could be wrong

Would love to hear your take on this

Edit: Would like to clarify that I'm not denying that terrorism isn't a threat. I just feel like it's not as big a priority as climate change",byfn81,,false,/r/india/comments/byfn81/how_big_of_a_threat_is_terrorism/,Politics

But it did bring something to my interest, the partition. This was in particular not b/c of what it showed but how some of the younger men reacted to it.

Some called it old and that it was not as important as the surgical strikes or pulwama. Though I do agree that they were important events I think most people are missing the point. 

MODERN INDO-PAK conflicts are occurring b/c of the partition.

1. One of the biggest reasons why so many people died was b/c so an eye for an eye. Muslims would kill Hindus b/c Hindus killed Muslims and viceversa. In this event many people not even at the border lost family members and thus older people back then started blaming all of Pakistan for these deaths and the same happened in Pakistan and thus the parents instilled these feelings in their kids and this still happens today.

2. Millions of people were put in refugee camps and had to be provided for by the government thus this made the govt distracted from growing the country and led them to try and make it so these people would be able to stand on their own. Because of this the govt could not provide good enough jobs, health care and education to the masses so growth was stagnant. It took many years for them (refugees) to be able to stand on their own feet, thus by the time their kids grew up and could fend for themselves India started growing more and more.

This is just a rough idea at the moment. I'm sharing only so I can voice my thoughts. Feel free to criticize. 

While INC has been trying to cover both sides of the economic spectrum whilst walking a tight rope between the conservative right and progressive left, BJP has near monopoly on the conservative right. By nature of their affiliation with the far right and their historical roots in the trader castes they have successfully covered nearly all aspects of the right side of the political spectrum. 

Whats different this time, and is just one more reason BJP now has almost double the vote percentage INC has is that their ideological footprint is larger. They've made inroads in the traditional left of center space as well in the 2014-19 term. 


Ideologically, INC now has nearly nothing to offer that the BJP doesnt already. So where do they go from here? The only space left to grow (for both parties?) is now leftwards. Does the Congress have the will to move further left? 

The other option is to stand their ground and fight for the center-right space. They will need to join hands with regional players in earnest this time. And the beating the regional players have received in this nationals should be motivation enough for a few of them to consider more than just joining hands. 


Ridiculous? Whispers in the NCP camp already speak of mergers with Congress. There is a lot of potential for regional players to regain lost ground on hometurf using the Congress umbrella. This seems like the simplest way forward for the Congress. 


Much simpler than actually sweating it out with the proletariat.

The first was happened just after independence, in 1948. The second war in 1965. Third in 1971, with an objective to free Bangladesh (formerly known as East Pakistan). And the last one in 1999, also known as Kargil war. 

Both countries have already spent billion of dollars fighting each other, on some senseless wars. These wars have weaken the economy of both countries many times. People lost their jobs because of these wars, don't forget about the lives. In the future, these situations may occur again. But they also can be restricted. Only if all three countries decides to join hands and re-create the old India. It will serve many great cause, economically as well as politically.
There will be pros and cons of reunification of Indian subcontinent.

Pros:
1. Political stability in the region.
2. Geographically large area.
3. Subcontinent can stand up against terrorism. 
4. Better economy, because India is already a giant economically. Bangladesh's growth rate is also good and Pakistan will also contribute to the economy. 
5. Cultural diversity
6. J&amp;K crises will resolve.
7. There are some things which every country lacks, which will be fulfilled by other country.

CONS:
1. Pro-Hindu and Pro-Muslim will oppose in the beginning.
2. There are terrorist organisation in Pakistan, which Indian government will need to be deal with.
3. India will share borders with some countries with groups, like ISIS and Taliban, these groups will create instability in the country.",c7apxj,,false,/r/india/comments/c7apxj/reunification_of_indian_subcontinent/,Politics

1560008232,witwacky,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/by964x/with_the_emphatic_2019_lok_sabha_victory_i_feel/,14,1,,,"With the emphatic 2019 Lok Sabha Victory, I feel BJP has cemented its position for at least the next 25-30 years. I don't see a proper opposition to BJP (or Modi) being able to pose a serious challenge anytime soon.","There are a few reasons for my feeling this way:

&amp;#x200B;

1.Congress is now a spent force. If we thought the drubbing was thorough in 2014, a similar performance in 2019 means they are no longer seen as even a credible opposition, let alone a serious contender for the throne. They will, of course, refuse to see the writing on the wall and continue to promote the 'family' in one way or another. There are too many vested interests at work for the Gandhis to just be able to go away and for the Congress to stand on its own.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Congress hanging around and refusing to 'die' means there is no space for any other nationwide opposition force to rise up. The media will still like to project someone with the Gandhi name rather than some unknown who will not grab eyeballs, at least initially.

&amp;#x200B;

3. There is no way any other party or force will be able to match - in the foreseeable future - the BJP in terms of money, or committed cadre, or the ideological will to keep themselves alive, against all odds, till they achieve success. Look at the INC, or the Jana Sangh/BJP, both of whom struggled for 50+ years before they tasted power.

&amp;#x200B;

4. Dozens of small regional parties cobbling together a wobbly coalition and hoping that the people will put them into national power is, and will remain, a pipe dream. Even if that is to happen, they will not win, the BJP will lose. The BJP will have to royally fuck things up in every way possible (and not just occasional-fuck ups here or there, but a total and complete clusterfuck of fuck-ups) for that to come to pass.

&amp;#x200B;

5. In fact, the only opposition I can see coming in the near future is even *further right* than the current dispensation - people who will clamour for a Hindu rashtra, mandirs everywhere and a return to a 'pure' vedic way of life.

&amp;#x200B;

6. There is also a chance the extreme left will rise up, but I think that is unlikely given that they have been discredited the world over and have been steadily losing ground (and believers) within India itself.

&amp;#x200B;

7. Kejriwal had emerged on the scene and got nationwide exposure, but frittered away the great start he had because of over-ambition, chronic insecurity and being in too much of a hurry. He may still win Delhi, but as a national leader, he has a long, long way to go. And I don't think he has the patience for that. He pulls short -term stunts for short term gains, but when it comes to standing his ground, he chickens out. If he had the courage of his convictions he would have stayed in jail rather than apologise to Gadkari and others. His meteoric rise was a once-in-a-lifetime phenomenon. I don't see that being repeated even by someone who is made of sterner stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

8. The only thing that can rock BJP's boat, the way I see it, in the near future is if there is infighting, or powerful factions emerge within the BJP itself. This could be in the form of (purely as a hypothetical example) the Amit Shah faction vs the Yogi faction fighting for control of party and the nation post the Modi-era.",by964x,,false,/r/india/comments/by964x/with_the_emphatic_2019_lok_sabha_victory_i_feel/,Politics

Otto von Bismark- He always had a plan. From the rise of Prussia to the unification of Germany and becoming a country going to toe to toe with France and Britain.

Deng Xiaoping- rapidly consolidated his power and turned a semi-broke  country into a superpower and developed country at the global stage within 30yr

Hemant Kenkre
February 28, 2003 21:31 IST

Somehow, playing against Pakistan in Tests or one-dayers gets the best out of Indians, and vice-versa. Who can forget Javed Miandad's last ball six at Sharjah, or Anil Kumble's 10 for 74 in Delhi? Who can forget Zaheer Abbas's blazing assault, that hastened the end of the spin troika of Prasanna, Bedi and Chandrashekhar or Sunil Gavaskar's brilliant 97 during his swan song in Bangalore?

From what one has heard from Indian cricketers who have played against Pakistan, whatever the rivalry may be on the field, off the field there is lots of mutual admiration, respect and regard for each other.
My own personal favourite is the story of when a Pakistan XI led by the awe-inspiring Imran Khan took on the Cricket Club of India Golden Jubilee XI at the historic Brabourne Stadium, Mumbai, sometime in 1987-'88. 

The Pakistan team was playing this festival match as part of the CCI Golden Jubilee celebrations, and the CCI team had stalwarts like Roger Binny, Mohammad Azharuddin among others in its ranks.

Having been a member of the CCI cricket team, I was one of the 'volunteers' looking after the Indian dressing room, and was warned by the Pakistan manager that they would require a couple of fielders in case any of their stars decided that the hotel was a better place to be instead of the field.

Sure enough, after the guests had finished their batting and Chandrakant Pandit was smashing the ball around, Javed Miandad and Abdul Qadir decided to hop back to their hotel and the Pakistan manager looked toward us for much needed resources to patrol the Brabourne outfield.

Sachin had become a 'playing member' that year, and had played in Mumbai's senior league for the first time. The CCI's then president Madhav Apte (a former India player) had changed the rules to allow the 'minor' to step into the 'above-18 allowed' CCI cricket dressing room. Both were told to be available if required.

Kushroo was an obvious choice, having been one of the good fielders in the Mumbai cricket circuit. While Shishir Hattangadi (former Mumbai captain) and I were looking for 'fielder No. 2', we heard the (now famous) soft voice ask: 'Me Zaaoo Ka?' (Can I go?).
Even before we said 'yes' the curly-topped kid was on the  ground, rubbing shoulders with Wasim Akram, Imran, Rameez Raja, Mudassar Nazar!

India's pride and joy, Sachin Tendulkar, had in fact stepped on to the international  arena for the first time as a reserve fielder for a Pakistan XI! 

*I doubt if there can be a better example of what could be possible, if we were to propagate good relations between two neighbours who love peace and share the same passions, but are unfortunately kept away from each other by rabid politics and hateful propaganda.*

I have been there a couple times but never lived there so my opinion might not count. I won't pretend that I know fully what it's like to be a women in India but I know the pressure that my community puts on me even if we don't live there.

What I wanted to tell is something that has been weighing on my heart for a long time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Watching the news, hearing the stories my dad tells me about his female friends, walking around in the Indian neighborhood of my city... all of that hurt me very very deeply.  I'm not saying that all Indian men are like that, no, not at all. I'm saying that the eduction provided by society, the parents, schools, and the internet has led me to a conclusion that might not please everyone. 

&amp;#x200B;

Most Indian men I meet (not all!) have very predatory behaviour. I live in a city where I see more immigrants from all over the world than locals, but I almost only experience that kind of arrassment around them. Some have said very vile things in front of older shop owners who wouldn't defend me, but rather look down upon me because I went out there without my dad. To them that's the reason why I deserve to be treated like that. The only times I've been followed on the street and on the trains were with Indian men. I seriously don't want to come to this conclusion, but it's the truth.

They have no respect for women, they think you're just a piece of meat waiting to be bought, touched. Women are considered a source of income with the dowry. Did you know that the dowry must go to the wife after a marriage? And did you know that traditionally, the women is supposed to control the money in a marriage? Or did you know that it's stritcly forbidden in Hinduisim to ask for more dowry? (source: my dad, a brahman) 

And look where we are now... Women getting attacked with acid, raped, shaved, tortured, because the husband, or his family, is greedy. Greed will be the downfall of India, of civilization.

&amp;#x200B;

I love India with all my heart. It's my country, my nation, my people. I feel so confortable thinking of India, my family over there, but this has to stop. Women need to take actions, fast. I get so angry when I read the news, I cry just thinking about the state of the nation. A woman gave you your life, she carried you, cared for you and you dare treat another woman this way? 

&amp;#x200B;

What bothers me the most is that Indian men (the okay ones) leave that problem to the women, they don't wanna get involved. They don't help their Indian sisters, won't defend them, they stay silent... Silence is also a form of assault. Please, if you're a men witnessing a form of assault, help your Indian sisters.

So yes of course women need to take actions, be as violent as the men if need be. We have been told to hold back our anger to please. Please who? The elders who contribute to rape culture? The future husband who might not like your words of protest because he feels attacked ? Frick that. Fight back. They wanna be violent, so be it. 

Women: create groups, go after those who have hurt you but never payed the price of justice. Try to be as legal as possible, but if the law doesn't do justice, make your own justice. Remember that sometime ago, slavery was still legal. The justice system tolerated it, but it was immoral. If the system tolerated assault against women, fight back.

Triple Talaq is something that Islam itself traditionally frowns upon. Scholars have warned against it since time immemorial and it's generally strongly disliked. Its sole purpose was to serve as a remedy for the *really* troubled marriages and some historians believe that it was originally granted by the Prophet as a means for the 'women' who were married to the most despicable men so that they'd escape that relationship as soon as possible. But, as often tends to happen with most well-intentioned laws, people managed to find the loopholes and favored the 'letter' of the law over the 'spirit' of the law. And as such, most Muslims would be absolutely okay with the illegalization or nullification of triple talaq, but more on that towards the end.

Speaking of laws and women, Islam is the first religion in history to have given women 'rights': social rights, ownership rights, inheritance rights, marriage rights, the right to initiate divorce, the right to remarry, the right to be a witness and give testimony in matters requiring the same, the right to do business (the Prophet's first wife, Khadijah, was a wealthy merchant herself), the right to fight in battle and many many more. Fourteen HUNDRED years ago. 

But, over time, some Muslims twisted the teachings of Islam to suit their own purpose, misused and downright *violated* the very laws of Islam protecting the sanctity of women's rights.. And, over time, it also became okay for the rest of the world to somehow always find a way to judge the 'entirety' of the Muslim community and religion based on the examples set by these worst of Muslims, who are completely unrepresentative of both Islam and most Muslims. 

Anyway, before I digress, coming back to divorce.. So, more than 1400 years ago, Muslim women were granted the right to initiate divorce through the legal sharia process referred to as *'khula'*. (This when women around the world were either burned at the stake for wanting rights or had to promise to be married to the same man for seven lives or had to throw themselves into the pyre with him when he died.)

This is what the normal, the more 'preferred' mode of talaq (divorce) looks like: It's supposed to be done in three stages, over a period equaling roughly three months, and only after the grounds for it have been firmly established (infidelity, adultery, betrayal, loss of affection, etc). Even this 'normal' form of divorce is only meant to be the 'last resort' when nothing seems to have worked to save the marriage. The first month, provided the grounds for divorce are not major (infidelity and/or adultery) and if there is the slightest hope for reconciliation, both the spouses are encouraged to find common ground and rethink their stance, the second month, once again, is time for reflection and possible reconciliation, and only at the end of the third month, when *all* attempts at reconciliation have clearly failed, is the divorce deemed to be finalized and can the spouses part ways.

Anyway, THAT is the 'normal' approach of going about divorce in Islam. And surprise surprise, THAT is how most Muslims actually go about getting a divorce. Most Muslims, too, generally hate the idea of triple talaq. Remember, it's *supposed* to be an absolute last-resort measure, *if that*. Here's a report based on a survey which found that of all the divorce cases amongst Muslims, a mere '0.3' percent were identified as those performed through triple talaq. Less than 1 percent. 

https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/unimportance-of-triple-talaq-supreme-court-muslim-law-4678304/

Yes, 0.3 percent. THAT is how low the incidence of triple talaq really is. Let me just say it once again so it really sinks in. ZERO POINT THREE percent. 

But, how many of you knew that? Or rather, how many of you were led to believe that 'most' of the divorces among Muslims happen the triple talaq way? Or that it's so prevalent among Muslims that 'millions' of Muslim women are simply abandoned by their husbands within seconds? Or that it's because Islam itself encourages it? Or that it's because women simply have no rights in Islam to begin with? 

Many, if not everyone. 

That brings us now to the second, the hidden yet the more important part of this discussion: the 'politics, propaganda and Islamophobia' aspect of it. 

If you could time-travel to today's India from ten years before, odds are you'd find it barely recognizable. 2019 was supposed to be the year when we were just a year away from the watershed moment we dreamed of that would forever change our nation's destiny. We were going to be a developed, happy, prosperous nation, the vision of APJ Abdul Kalam come to life. 

But, it's safe to say that that dream is much farther from being a reality *today* than it was ten years ago. And however unrealistic or unattainable that dream may have been to begin with, I am sure nobody in their wildest dreams ever imagined an India where a 'terrorist' would be elected to the parliament and become a 'lawmaker' in 2019.

A deeply radicalized, bigoted and easily manipulated religious majority has set the country back by many many years, if not decades. Such is the level of toxic propaganda and such is the intolerance of the truth that nothing and absolutely nothing seems to have the potential to stem the flow of this madness anytime soon. 

And it is in this backdrop that it became possible for a man who abandoned his mother, abandoned his wife decades ago and presided over riots that saw hundreds of women get brutally killed and thousands get raped, to rise to be the 'messiah' for Muslim women and their rights and for everyone else to buy into this whole charade. 

And this allowed everyone to believe that the 'logical' solution to correct the injustice of triple talaq was to 'jail' the man for three years based on a report filed by almost anyone, keep the woman on a measly welfare fund for the same duration, keep her children far away from their father and, thus, eventually, to 'save' the marriage. 

If you still think that the triple talaq bill, in its present manifestation, is anything other than a deeply hateful, vengeful exercise of power through which to punish Muslims for, well, *being* Muslims, you clearly are on the wrong side of history.

Despite submitting all relevant documents proving her residence and marriage, her name was excluded from the first draft of the NRC and we had to appeal again to get her name into the second draft. After resubmitting the same documents again her name did get registered into the second draft but this time she was asked to register her biometrics and link it with her NRC data. 

Well and fine, right? Nope. 

Apparently, submitting biometrics means applying for Aadhaar card and linking it with NRC data. Despite informing the officials repeatedly that she already has an Aadhar card and that all they need is to provide a linkage form and not re-apply for Aadhar since it is a legal offence, they insisted that her previous Aadhar was invalid and that it was compulsory for those whose names were entered in the second draft to apply for Aadhar. 

We had no option but to go ahead and let them re submit her biometrics for a new Aadhar, which expectedly was rejected since she already has an Aadhar card! Surprise, surprise.

We called the Aadhar helpline to ask about NRC linkage and they straight out denied providing any such service. So we called the NRC helpline, and the only advice we got was to approach the DC office to find out 'why your aadhar application has been rejected'. They insisted that her Aadhar could not be valid since her name was only registered in the second draft.

We had go and visit the appellate centre again and this time they did link the old Aadhar with her NRC data but flat out denied that they made any mistake. 

We are probably the lucky ones though. We have been hearing stories of harassment and misleading instructions from the NRC officials from a lot of our friends and neighbours. It is nothing short of institutionalised harassment. They have not even properly constructed a logical system to facilitate the entire process and it seems to run on whimsies of the top officials.

More serious stories of harassment are coming into light like the one below:
https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/women-declared-foreigner-in-assam-her-family-claims-roots-in-bihar-2059247?amp=1&amp;akamai-rum=off

&gt;A 40-year-old woman was arrested and sent to a detention centre in Assam earlier this month after a tribunal declared her a foreigner. Her family, however, claimed her father was born in Bihar and they have been living in Assam since the British era. 

&gt;Amila Sah was arrested on June 15 from Dholaibeel area in Sonitpur district. A Foreigners' Tribunal on April 30 declared that Ms Sah had failed to prove that she was the daughter of Keshab Prashad Gupta, who was born in Nalanda in Bihar and had moved to Pratapgarh Tea Estate in Assam in 1948.

&gt;However, the names of Ms Sah's family members, including her siblings, have been added to the National Register of Citizens (NRC) draft. 

&gt;Her son Bhola Sah said, ""It's not the question of NRC. NRC is to detect illegal migrants from a foreign land. We are migrants from mainland India, from Bihar, how can my mother be a foreigner.""",c5r1n2,,false,/r/india/comments/c5r1n2/nrc_process_ongoing_in_assam_is_a_joke/,Politics

1559366664,ExMuslimHyderabad,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bvhgmp/an_interesting_take_on_indian_elections_by/,55,39,,,An interesting take on Indian elections by Shekhar Gupta at Centre for Policy Research on 'How India Voted',"This is going to be a long read but one of the best post-election analysis that I've seen. I have transcribed, paraphrased, and highlighted what Gupta said [here](https://youtu.be/mL5quXQzLkY?t=4925).

Today Congress and the rest can complain about resources but in 2014 Congress was in power and Modi was an outsider and yet he won. To analyse this, we need to forget our voting preferences and admit that Modi’s rise is not a fraud on India. Modi’s is a phenomenon and has had a better story and a better product to sell for almost a decade. 

Since it suited everybody around Congress, they said BJP lost 2004 due to 'India Shining'. Cut down those number : **BJP just got 9 seats less than Congress. BJP lost due to Gujarat 2002 where BJP's previous allies (Mamata, CBN) were no longer willing to ally with them since BJP refused to fire Modi**

**Another myth was spread after 2009 when the incumbent came back with a larger majority than the previous one. Who do you then give credit to? If you credit it to MMS, it’s an outrage in the Congress party.** So you have to find an excuse and credit it to Mrs.Gandhi and whatever she had done. So you say loan waivers and MNREGA. 

In urban areas, where least poor 30% people live Congress party’s strike rate in 2009 was 68%. In the areas where 70% of Indias poorest live, Congress party’s strike rate was 30 something percent. This data was available, and the party was not willing to see the reasons that **India had seen 7 years of breathless growth and because the intellectual establishment and political darbaar of the Congress party was not willing to accept that, they undermined UPA2**,and pushed it back - people got so angry who got used to growth people brought in Modi from Gujarat because he’ll bring you something. 

**In this election campaign, the most striking thing was Modi getting away with saying that nothing happened in this country before 2014** - that history of this country begins in 2014. That is not true. **The previous 10 years had a lot of growth, built a lot of infrastructure - many things happened**. Look at the way global economic downturn was handled by India, it was a great economic success story. Look at how Satyam was handled. But the amazing thing was, in so many days of campaigning I never heard anyone from the Congress party say anything about what their govt did under UPA2. 

**This is the autoimmune disease of the Congress party. This Congress party wants to blame Modi, media - they’re watching the wrong channels. That fact is the only achievements the Congress party was willing to talk about was not even of Rajiv Gandhi but of Indira Gandhi when 80% of the voters are born after Indira Gandhi had passed away.** So don’t blame others. Look inside - the voter is transactional. The transaction for the voters is NREGA money, the gas cylinder, or it can also be the pride/security of the country and how good is the leader. 


**This idea of keeping India secular has been outsourced to it’s 15% muslims. The muslims are fed up because nobody does anything for them but you keep dragging them everywhere as if it’s their responsibility.** *You have to save secularism, I have the Yadavs with me, so and so will bring the Dalits.* Dalits are not with her anymore. She has has 10 seats, Akhilesh has 5 seats. That tells you that Mayawati is finished because Akhilesh has been able to transfer his Muslim votes to her, but she hasn’t been able to transfer her Dalit votes to him. The Dalit votes are now changing.

This time as I drove around the country I would just get ordinary people and ask who are you voting for and why and record it. I have 60 of these recordings. All 60 are voting for Modi. From north KA, south KA, Bengal, UP, Bihar, MP, Rajasthan, Haryana. You can blame media, money, whatever but **if in Haryana if BJP can get 68% vote, and Haryana’s premier Jatt party INLD only gets 1.8% that tells you, that you are looking at something new.** Somebody just had a much better product. So respect the verdict, but for that first you have to first accept that there was a much better product on offer. 

People have been defeated despite money. Look at CBN, he wasn’t short of money in Andhra. **You can have a great organisation but you need to have workers who have the commitment.** Look at what YS Reddy has built in AP. It’s an organisation that can fight BJP anyway. Look at Mamata in WB - if it weren’t for BJP would have gotten 35 seats. 

**The voter in this country does not trust Congress schemes. Anything that happened in the past, very little got to the voter. This time LPG, the house, and toilets. I was looking for evidence to the contrary but we were not finding it. We were finding gas cylinders - we would even peek inside the houses and found gas cylinders. You build a house govt gave you 1.5 lac, you build a toilet and govt gave you 15k. The govt didn’t build anything for you - they used Direct Benefit Transfer. The used the JAM trinity. Jandhan - Aadhar - Mudra loans. Initially I thought Mudra loans were all rubbish and they were all fake. But I have videos of a Dalit saying that I got 50K mudra loans to build a chai shop and I pay 1300 per month back and if I don’t the branch manager comes. Check the data - 4.81 cr have gotten Mudra loans and 2.1 cr loans has been dispensed.**

**I have to say, we journalists and commentariat chose not to see it. Even when we see it, we compulsively tried to deny it. *“Oh they’ve got gas cylinders - but they cant afford the next one”.* But the fact is they got one. *“Oh the next one is full price”* - that is a lie - the next one is not full price. Next one you pay the full price and you get your subsidy back in the Jandhan bank account. But once you have the connection - you’re empowered. Once you have the toilet, *“Oh but water is not there”* - but the water will come. The fact is these people had never seen delivery of anything. And even if they got anything they did not see anything they could get without having to bribe including in most cases the NREGA wages.** So this is a big change. This is a big governance exercise - you may like it or not like it. But smart people will learn from it. KCR did, Babu did it and now Jagan will do it. Non-smart people will complain about. 

It’s wrong to say this is only Hindutva. Hindutva has helped Modi consolidate upper caste. I have never seen any caste vote bank so cohesive. Because they also see him as this guy having protected “merit” . Ensure that these other “faltus” don’t walk into this territory. He has taken away all the other OBC’s simply because caste based parties became family run parties. Because SP &amp; RJD family run Yadav parties - Yadav stayed there, other OBC’s fled. Similarly for Dalits - jatavs became powerful, the rest have fled. 

In a lot of rallies, Rahul spoke out “Chowkidar char hai” - a lot of people spoke out went back saying “Ye angrez Aadmi hai, jo apna desi Aadmi hai aur khudse banke aaya hai use chor bol rahe hai” . There was this video going around where Priyanka was talking about Rahul being black belt, diving,pilot etc. This was being circulated by the other side! The ordinary people were saying they also wanted to dive, become a pilot. So they started asking what does Rahul do that he has so much money. This India hates elitism. Modi is now elite - he dresses well, he’s got style. People say he has earned it unlike you guys who came because your daddy gave it to you.",bvhgmp,,false,/r/india/comments/bvhgmp/an_interesting_take_on_indian_elections_by/,Politics

Now, most of the seats which BJP got in the last 2 elections was in the image of Modi. They voted for Modi and not always for the candidate of that constituency. The modi �� if you will.


When Modi retires and is no longer the pm candidate, do you think people will vote in the same way for Amit Shah? He's nowhere near as ""charismatic"" as Modi even though he's a much better talker (and a more cunning politician).

So I frequented themoviedb.org site liking the non-sense approach.

It has an active desi community and all the new Indian movies are updated with good info. So I tired to slowly replace IMDb with this site-- only on the fine the following message is displayed: 

&gt;The URL has been blocked as per the instructions of the Competent Government Authority/ in compliance to the orders of Court of Law.

I can't even fathom why anyone would ban a movie info site (but leave IMDb alone?!). Did your ISP also banned this site? What can we do so they will unban this innocent site?

The storylines of Bombay Velvet's Balraj (Ranbeer Kapoor) and Sacred Games Ganesh Gaitonde(Nawaz) are too similar to ignore. 

&amp;#x200B;

Both came to bombay, mother was a --beep-- and wanted to be a Big Shot.

They both fall in love with a singer / performer and get her from a powerful person. 

&amp;#x200B;

In bombay velvet the movie looks like \`U/A\` version of Sacred Games. 

&amp;#x200B;

Balraj kills the mother's lover but no blood is shown. In sacred games, the lover is killed by a stone and a final scene of mother and the lover on bed is shown. 

&amp;#x200B;

In Velvet the performer is lured by the protagonist in simple way. In Sacred games, she is shown to be going for the person who is worth of her. Not some random boxer. 

&amp;#x200B;

In 25 minutes at the movie we don't know what is the purpose of all the people what they crave for, except for Balraj's but in Sacred Games 25 minutes, we know who all the person's are in 1st episode only.

&amp;#x200B;

I (along with my friends) wanted Bombay Velvet to be some Scorcese level shit but it was not. 

Sacred Games is. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just wanted to vent  so it's here now. 

There are so many problems in the country with Chennai water crisis and encephalitis outbreak but I couldn't do any thing so changed my mind to watch movies. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do you remember 2 years back ( or 1 year ) over 80+ children died due to encephalitis in Yogi's gorakhpur and the the response was this happens every year and why this is made an issue this year. 80+ children in 1 day. I cried that day but it has become so normal each year that it's fine for us. We did yoga today in my office. Fucking yoga where 20+ people are in jeans and people were talking about that because they know that due to corporate insurance policy their children will be fine. They will get best care. 

&amp;#x200B;

I understand there are multiple issues but after election no one is talking about the accountability of these politicians. It's news that a person is watching mobile while the president is giving speech and there are debates on that. 100 children died and no issue of health care. 

&amp;#x200B;

There is more to vent but I am just tired of writing now.

&gt;Of the 373 constituencies polled in the first four phases, there were  surplus votes counted in over 220 of them – in the rest, vote deficits  were recorded. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“This  is very disturbing as I have read that three former CECs – SY Qureshi,   N Gopalaswami, HS Brahma – are reported to have said that the EC should  explain these discrepancies. That is the only way the credibility of  the EC can be restored.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Jagdeep Chokker, Member, Association of Democratic Reform

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; The former chief election commissioner Rawat says, “The vote polled data  will always increase, not decrease.” The reason for this is that the  estimates for turnout are given based on data collected on polling day.  By the end of polling day, this number is sure to have risen. 

&amp;#x200B;

**This happened in Tamilnadu where a growing party AMMK polled zero in 300 which means even the booth agents dint vote for the party. Which is absurd.** 

&gt;[recording a vote share of around 5.3%, AMMK general secretary T T V Dhinakaran alleged on Sunday that several votes have “disappeared”. He said the party got nil vote in about 300 booths, which meant even the AMMK booth agents didn’t vote for the party.](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/ttv-dhinakaran-shocked-at-ammk-getting-nil-vote-in-300-booths/articleshow/69511849.cms)

&amp;#x200B;

**Election comission tweets an article from opIndia, which takes Quora as its source in defense of EVM hacking.**

&gt;[The Election Commission on Wednesday tried to substantiate its stand that electronic voting machines (EVMs) are tamper-proof by sharing on social media a first-person account carried by a controversial Right-wing website.](https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/election-commission-tweets-content-from-a-controversial-right-wing-website/cid/1691037)

&amp;#x200B;

# Can we trust EVM's still, is the mother of democracy being whored around ? 

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr : Votes Polled *not equal to* Votes counted, election commission fails to explain.

1561395155,NOTA-Voter,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c4raen/psa_the_news_going_around_claiming_that_21_indian/,63,244,,,PSA: The news going around claiming that 21 Indian cities will run out of groundwater by 2020 is probably fake.,"1. All news outlets are citing [this](https://niti.gov.in/writereaddata/files/document_publication/2018-05-18-Water-Index-Report_vS8-compressed.pdf) NITI Aayog report released in June 2018.
2. On page 123 of the report it says ""by 2020, 21 major cities, including Delhi, Bangalore, and Hyderabad, are expected to reach zero groundwater levels, affecting access for 100 million people.""
3. However, this is not the report's original finding. The citation says: ""Source: World Bank (Hindustan Times, The Hindu)"".
4. Could not find anything about this on The Hindu (before June 2018), but [this](https://www.hindustantimes.com/brand-stories/world-water-day-a-positive-message-amidst-a-daunting-global-crisis/story-3oQrJ1aOwrvQpiMqYJC4JM.html) Hindustan Times article from May 2018 says: ""According to a 2012 World Bank report, at least 21 Indian cities are moving towards zero ground water level by 2020, if drastic measures aren’t taken up.""
5. The World Bank report from 2012 is not a report but an [article](http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2012/03/06/india-groundwater-critical-diminishing). The article does not say anything about the cities. It recommends a World Bank [report](http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/272661468267911138/pdf/516760ESW0P0951round0Water129101110.pdf) from 2010 for reference.
6. Nowhere in that 2010 report it mentions about Indian cities running out of groundwater.
7. The blame goes to Hindustan Times for probably putting fake citation, NITI Aayog for probably hiring clueless interns to write reports and news outlets for blindly citing NITI Aayog reports without cross-checking.",c4raen,,false,/r/india/comments/c4raen/psa_the_news_going_around_claiming_that_21_indian/,Politics

As far as I'm aware, there's no official reason provided by GoI or Rajan but rumours point towards demonetization and Rajan being opposed to that.

They further outline how real Hindutva is actually secular and tolerant, which is exactly the same argument that was used to prop Pakistan. Coming to the title of this post, the problem with a theocratic State is that the state itself gains legitimacy from religion — and exists in close tandem with religion. As a result, countries such as UAE and Saudi Arabia closely control and influence aspects of the religion. So much so that Friday sermons across mosques in the UAE are same, and vetted by the Government. Rather than freeing up temples from Government control, a Hindutva State will likely assume more authority and control its aspects.

1560548246,eggityEgg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c0pmnt/supremacist_tendencies_among_some_indians_leading/,4,9,,,Supremacist tendencies among some Indians leading to resentment,"First time posting on Reddit. Contemplating migrating here because of the right-wing shitshow that Quora is.  


I grew up in Odisha and worked for a few years in Mumbai before leaving for the US. I never got to meet many non-Odia people during my time in Odisha. However, having met Indians from other states during my stint in Mumbai and subsequently, in the US, I realized that Indians from a few states are unapologetically chauvinist. In my experience, the most chauvinist ones are Punjabis, Maharashtrians, Bengalis, Malayalis and Tamils (in no particular order). I was glancing over old posts on here and my intuition was validated. The points below contain lots of generalization.  


Punjabi supremacy is just racist. They don't really care about their language. I had a Punjabi Khurana for a roommate when I was working in Mumbai. This jackass would tell me how Punjabis are better warriors, have a better ""attitude"" and look better than other Indians. Just plain retarded shit.  


I did see some Marathi chauvinism during my time in Mumbai like some MNS or Shiv Sena types harassing north Indian street food hawkers (although I am told that this is primarily a Mumbai thing and not a pan-Maharashtra thing). If you are willing to look beyond that, Marathis are some of the nicest people you'll meet (after Telugus IMO).  


The less spoken about Bengalis, the better. I remember an incident at an Indian gathering in the US where I said that Telugu was the sweetest language in India. OFC, this Bengali girl had to interject with how Bengali is the sweetest language on earth. There is always this expectation that Odias must somehow be able to speak Bengali which is extremely annoying. Bengalis are uniformly disliked for their condescending attitudes by other east Indian ethnicities like Assamese, Biharis, and Odias.  


The recent floods in Kerala were an eye-opener for me. Many Malayalis on social media were screaming about how the country had betrayed them and what not. Some never miss an opportunity to bring up the fact that they are the most literate state. I guess literacy didn't help when incompetent leaders were unprepared for a flood. Poor illiterate Odisha did a far better job in disaster management when it was hit by cyclone Fani (one of many to hit the state). And Odias didn't blame anyone else. I donated a hundred dollars for flood relief in Kerala. But the whole drama on social media made me wonder if that was the correct decision.  


Quora and Facebook (Reddit?) are chock full of Tamil nationalists claiming cultural and linguistic supremacy. Hindi imperialism must be resisted (especially with BJP at the helm). However, obnoxious linguistic chauvinism is not the answer either.   


There are genuine complaints from south Indian states about the revenue sharing model that the central Govt. follows. However, tax revenues alone are not the only way a state contributes to the nation. Odisha disproportionately contributes to the mineral production of the country. The freight equalization policy hurt Odisha the most and not Bihar or Bengal. Central PSUs (that employ ""outsiders"") ship the mineral wealth of my state to set up industries in other states and pocket the profits. These sectors (coal, iron, and aluminum) are essentially monopolies or pseudo-monopolies where the state is subservient to the Center. My father who used to work for the state's Dept. of Energy would me how the central Govt. would arm-twist Odisha into signing unfavorable power purchase agreements with politically powerful states. The East Coast Railways is one of the most profitable zonal divisions of Indian railways. But the railway network in Odisha (+ Jharkhand and Chhatisgarh) is one of the sparsest outside the Thar desert. The railway lines in the state just connect the mines to nearby ports. The center loots us but is unwilling to invest in building infrastructure in the state. The construction of Dhamra port was held up because the Bengalis were afraid that their Haldia port would lose revenue because of competition. The official reasons are always environmental clearance or defense ministry objections.   


This is the curse of being a politically insignificant state. Wouldn't we be better off with more autonomy? Odisha doesn't have a large population. It has a long coast-line, sufficient water resources and ample mineral wealth. Isn't it time for Odisha to reevaluate our relationship with the Center? Growing up in India, I was proud to call myself an Indian. I hope that continues.

Basically, I thought that the Congress and BJP weren't too different, and what was needed was a way to shake up the system. Unlike, say, the GOP vs Dems in the USA, I figured that Indian politicians are basically on the same page when it comes to technocratic issues---they all support similar paradigms when it comes to advancing infrastructure, healthcare, education etc.

During the India Against Corruption movement I wasn't necessarily fully aligned with Anna Hazare---(you can't just demand the government instantly pass your preferred legislation via hunger strikes)---but I supported their right to organize. After the Nirbhaya incident, I was upset when they banned protesting at India gate, and I got especially mad when a policeman died of a heart attack and the cops tried to pin it as a murder on young AAP activists. I personally joined a vigil at Jantar Mantar. The need for change was in the air; there was restlessness among the youth, and various groups were coming together to ask for something different.

This anti-incumbency is why I voted for AAP in the 2013 Delhi elections. I didn't have anything against Sheila Dixit, but my view was the UPA had gotten arrogant, and the BJP wasn't all that different, so we needed new blood in the system.

Boy, was I in for a rethink.

First Arvind Kejriwal disappointed me instantly by going on dharnas shortly after becoming CM. And his cause---putting the Delhi Police under his control--(which he continues to pursue, to the extent of making it a major issue in the lok sabha elections!) is not something I care about, or even consider advisable. Then I found the Odd-Even car rationing adventures silly as well, given that passenger cars are a minor contributor to Delhi pollution compared to factors like crop stubble burning.

Meanwhile Kiran Bedi turned out to be a partisan, and the rest of her BJP cohort turned out to be amateurs.  The government kept creating marketing schemes that had little to show in ground results (Make in India, Skill India, Startup India, Clean India.) Not to mention recruiting us all into their Yoga Day programs, and Ms. Irani deciding that Christmas is now an essay-contest called Good Governance Day.

High profile lynchings happened, and members of the establishment party blew off the issue by saying 'law and order is a state subject'. Then the obsession with 'black money' led us into the demonetization disaster, one of the worst economic-policy blunders in history.  Then they almost shut down my phone and bank account because I hadn't linked them with Aadhaar, stopping only because the Supreme Court intervened. On top of all that Arun Jaitley's finance ministry shoved through the GST and followed up it up with nearly weekly amendments. Fuel prices were low in the international market but our government kept the price high to reap the excise benefit.

I haven't even mentioned the right-wing propaganda machine with many television channels and corporate houses in lockstep with the agenda. I still don't understand why Balakot is seen as some sort of triumph when the effect of the bombings are in dispute, and meanwhile we got our pilot captured and hit our own helicopter with a missile (killing six men).

I'm not saying the government didn't do any good work at all, but I recognize that many of the schemes they implemented (like basic bank accounts and direct benefit transfer) were initiated by Manmohan Singh's government.

On top of all that, now I have a better understanding of the theoretical nature of the UPA 'scams'. For example, the 2G losses were hypothetical. It's not like the lakhs of crores that were being mentioned went directly into some politician's pocket.

In summation, I was very wrong to think the Congress and BJP are almost the same. It turns out, the BJP is innately an opposition party and incapable of governance. I await UPA-3.",bwlkyo,,false,/r/india/comments/bwlkyo/i_regret_being_anticongress/,Politics
1559650139,Elonq,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bwnyhc/showerthought_if_modi_will_be_defeated_it_will_be/,14,9,,,"[ShowerThought] If Modi will be defeated, it will be by popularity rather than policy or performance.","Even after so many missteps and lack lustre delivery on promises made, the country has awarded him a larger mandate. That would indicate that the 2014 win was not merely a stroke of good luck.


The only way to bring him down seems to be by bringing an opponent with a personality that's even more larger than life than Modi's. If Modi wrestled crocodiles as a child, you need someone that rode tigers to school. If Modi spent years in the Himalayas doing tapasya, you need someone hermetically raised in those mountains. You need someone that has Chuck Norris Facts like credentials and has mass appeal in the cow belt that can translate into the south. 


I dont know who that person could be. But maybe its someone like Salman Khan. I dont want to get into why it cant be Salman. Just saying it needs to be someone like that. An entertainer perhaps - a comedian, actor, cricketer idk. Someone that has a personality that can eclipse Modi's image.

We need a law that mandates minimum 33% seat allocation by every political party.,"Yes, all we need is a law to mandate every political party (participating in more than 2 seats in a given election) to allocate 33 percent seats to women.

Two reasons for this view. 

1. Current failure of SC/ST reservation policy for Loksabha seats. As we know a total of 24.01%(131) seats are reserve to SC/ST combined. Now when this happens, all the candidates participating are from SC/ST for that seat. Hence the SC/ST votes are split. Hence, SC/ST community fails to elect a strong leader to represent them. Instead, this split vote results in victory of a candidate picked by others(Upper Castes). ([This is that reason close to 55% of reserved seats are won by BJP](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/half-of-bjps-additional-mps-from-sc/st-constituencies/articleshow/69501208.cms). Or Congress took advantage earlier). This defeats the whole purpose of reservation as it does not empower the community. If we reserve 33% seats to women, there will be similar scenario where all women are pitted against each other. The weakest one which men choose will be the one representing.
2. Success of TMC and BJD experiment in recent election. [Both parties allocated more then 33% percent seats.](https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/tmc-fields-41-women-bjd-promises-33-will-other-political-parties-take-cue-98300) [Result is that more than 33% percent of candidates elected from these parties are women.](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/42-of-bjd-mps-are-women-highest-ever-for-any-party/articleshow/69490501.cms)

Upvote if you agree. Down vote if you don't and comment if you would like to add on..


1) Complete reform to education. Elective subjects. Common syllabus for Science, mathematics, civil studies and tax education.

2) Ayodhya : Supreme Court hands over the land to Hindus who will build the best mosque the world has ever seen.

3) J&amp;K declared as a union territory. Border be made global line.

4) All courts to be given same importance as Supreme Court. Supreme Court is not Supreme but a federated court of appeal.

5) Uniform civil code. You have the right to practice your religion and faith  but all public activities are as dictated by laws. 

6) Priority to passing rural infrastructure projects and agro projects. 

7) No mandatory conditions on language studies nor history studies. 

8) Capital punishments to repeat and multiple offences of rape, corruption and human trafficking.

Imgur has a 30 second upload cap so couldn't put up the whole thing and reddit uploader is crap.

** Not a Neem seed but Two

The video clip is SD 480p, 30fps with time lapse interval of 1800x(60 second-interval). Phone is Redmi 3s. I started recording at 7:30 AM and stopped at 1:30 AM so it went on for about 19 hours and I got a 36 sec time-lapse out of it. 

 You will observe sudden change in position and a jump cut type thing once in middle that was not an edit. I was just moving the pod around a little bit for a better angle and also the lighting setup was not really professional grade. Took way longer than I anticipated but yeah I am happy with the results ��

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) affects children and teens and can continue into adulthood. ADHD is the most commonly diagnosed mental disorder of children. Children with ADHD may be hyperactive and unable control their impulses. Or they may have trouble paying attention. These behaviors interfere with school and home life. 

Common symptoms-
Is easily distracted; Doesn't follow directions or finish tasks; Doesn't appear to be listening; Doesn't pay attention and makes careless mistakes; Forgets about daily activities; Has problems organizing daily tasks; Doesn’t like to do things that require sitting still; Often loses things; Tends to daydream

(https://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/childhood-adhd/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd link for more info)

These things are often mistaken with laziness, which is really not the case. I am sure there are people who suffer from it, but don't know it themselves because they don't know such a thing exists. 

This struck me when i watched a YouTuber's (Ryan Higa's) video who has ADHD, and made a video about it. Till then, i didn't even know such a thing exists, mainly because of absence of conversation. Parents don't tend to talk with their children about various mental diseases, and it happens either because they feel uncomfortable about it, or they also don't know anything about it. I didn't even know what OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) was until i watched a stand up set about it. 

The reason i decided to write and share it is because after watching the video and taking some online surveys about it, i thought i had it. I shared it with my friend and she said it is only in my head (as people mostly address depression - it's only in your head) and then later thought that it is some kind of a serious mental illness. She and all my friends don't know it is normal, and not an excuse of laziness. Having this is not a big deal and is not some rare shit. That was the moment i realized how we as a society don't know about some important things and that needed to be discussed. 

I'm really sorry if you think this is stupid, but I'm sure this will generate some discussion and that was the main purpose. And people who didn't know about it, well now you do. If you are a teenager or young, make sure to check if you have it or not. It can affect with your day to day life. And adults, if you think people around you may have it, start a conversation and help them the way you can. Trust me, it's not laziness, it's serious. 

The link of Ryan's ADHD video which i watched - https://youtu.be/5GBMS7WPFSs 
Note: this is not an educational video, it's just a video through which i got introduced to the concept of ADHD. 

A subreddit for it, check it out of you want to: r/ADHD

I have a 2.5 year old beautiful son. My wife/in-laws has always asked me for monies. Before marriage wife said nice things but only after marriage they started demanding money by saying that we are poor and we want to build house and that her dad(my FIL) is seriously ill, who died in Sep 2016. I helped them for 1 lakh rupees. I was in London at that time. After I came back from London in Dec 2015, my wife got pregnant in January and I decided to stay back here with wife. Our son was born in Oct 2016. 

After son was born wife started demanding money in the name of son. But I quickly figured she does not spend money for son but instead she gives money to her mother/brother. So I stopped giving money and started to ask what does she need money for. And when she said something about buying stuff I'd buy the stuff myself but never handed her money. 

This has made her angry and she keeps verbally abusing me and my dad. I have audio recordings of her abusing. She started threatening me of divorcing me, however she doesn't have guts to do it. She involves her brother and mother in threatening me too. She keeps telling other people that I beat her, but never have. 

My dad had heart stroke on 30th may and she has since left me with my son to her mother's place. Now she is refusing to let me talk to my son over phone. I have all this documented in sms and call recordings. 

What steps can I take to divorce her and keep son. I want to go back to America soon and give my son good education and better living environment. Although now she has my son she is emotionally blackmailing me by keeping my son from me. 

PS: I am in Gujarat. Can I file divorce and present them the abuse and threatening of divorce?  I'll be glad to give more information if required, sorry I am not in a good state of mind.

1560091229,[deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bykuvn/caught_between_animosities_india_is_increasingly/,0,1,,,"Caught between animosities, India is increasingly losing sight of it's potential for greatness","The Constitution of India is one of the most impressive (a)political documents in the world.  Drawing from the best(at that particular time) of ideologies around the world, it was condensed succinctly into easy, explainable words, generalised as to ensure flexibility, which evolves with the social and political climate of the times. 
And inclusiveness has been an integral part of Bharat since the Vedic society. The caste system was a product of the times, but wasn't something enforced on people of other beliefs as they came into contact with the indigenous community of the subcontinent. The use of the term Hinduism to describe a collection of practices and beliefs is a recent European construction, the term ""Hindu"" was coined in position to other religions and used to describe those that were not of the other religions. Before the British began to categorise communities strictly by religion, Indians generally did not define themselves exclusively through their religious beliefs; identities were segmented on the basis of locality, language, caste, occupation and sect. Initially referring to the geographical area beyond the Indus river, it gained popularity as catch all for the purpose of description rather than understanding. The core tenet of Dharma - a way of life - is much broader than the term religion gives it credit for. Because of the wide range of traditions and ideas covered by the term Hinduism, arriving at a comprehensive definition is difficult. It defies desire to define and categorize it, and to grossly understates the spectrum of beliefs - polytheistic, pantheistic, panentheistic, pandeistic, henotheistic, monotheistic, monistic, agnostic, atheistic or humanist - which exist within it. 
And since these ""Hindus"" were tolerant of other beliefs being practised alongside theirs , because of the wide spectrum amongst themselves as a whole, it became known as a land for tolerance. 
People often use the justification that Hindus never waged war - that idea is incorrect. They waged war on each other - motivated by money, resources to name a few, and since there are formidable barriers to accessing the subcontinent - rivers, mountains,seas, deserts, it was relatively self contained. Invasions happen because of two primary motivations - lack or resources in the current place and abundance of resources in another. And they waged war over it and won. And since now the invaders had control over the source of the resource, they set about strengthening their hold, and introduced new belief systems into the subjugated region. Some people may have found the concept of a singular, non anthropomorphic God attractive, we can't say for sure. Maybe forced conversions took place. All we know is that a new faith entered the previously mono religious subcontinent. Similarly, the European came searching for trade routes, and established them. Differing ideologies came into contact and they gradually took over overtly waging war under the guise of carefully crafted reasons. The reasons people tend to discard old beliefs is (grossly)ABC. It's gives Assurances that salvation is achievable through Belief in a precise theology, and that Conversion will infact let them lead better life. 
By the time 1947 cane around, there is a multitide of Faith's co- exsisting in the subcontinent. The forefathers of the Constitution knew better than to oust ""new"" religions just because they were new. That's why generalised open terminologies to ensure inclusiveness were inscribed. And it's only been modified by addition, and not subtraction - because subtraction takes away the inclusiveness. 
With Liberals bemoaning the increasingly unsafe environment propagated by Conservatives who are demanding that people of other religions leave them be, there is fault in both sides. Someone in the present cannot be held responsible for what atrocities happened in the past, and that doesn't give you the right to prosecute them for not believing in your ""idea"" of God. These percieved injustices  in both sides cannot be what defines the nation today. Because all it will lead is to attrition. The world has become a much smaller place and is both better and worse for it. As a nation predominantly populated by ""Hindu's"" the aim should be aiming for inclusiveness not exclusiveness. For example, the matter of consumption of cow meat. Slaughter of animals was frowned upon in Hinduism, but wasn't not mandatory. Non violence applied to all animals equally. Gandgi once said: ""I worship it and I shall defend its worship against the whole world"", and stated that ""The central fact of Hinduism is cow protection."" Yet even Gandhi never called for the banning of cow slaughter in India. Stating
“How can I force anyone not to slaughter cows unless he is himself so disposed? It is not as if there were only Hindus in the Indian Union. There are Muslims, Parsis, Christians and other religious groups here.”
Now The slaughter of cattle is allowed with restrictions (like a 'fit-for-slaughter' certificate which may be issued depending on factors like age and gender of cattle, continued economic viability, etc.), but only for bulls and buffaloes and not cows in fourteen states. It is completely banned in six states with pending litigation in the supreme court to overturn the ban, while there is no restriction in many states. 
To act in rumours and blind belief without allowing for explanations or the legal process to investigate, and by taking matters into our own hands, we are fostering a aura of intolerance and fear mongering , which inevitably leads to conflict as the oppressed section will eventually respond to continued denigration. And liberals are no better . If they are so intelligent, and better off than the conservatives, why haven't they made the great strides they profess to achieve in the years when a predominantly liberal government was at the helm. That does not give the conservatives an out. The liberals failed. You have the opportunity to do better. Do not state the failures of previous thought processes as your reason for your lack  of success. A fresh start is your hands. The rise of jingoism is a dangerous precedent. It promotes vigilantism and is violated the sense of security a nation should provide it's citizens. Live your life as you would see fit. You wouldn't appreciate someone forcing their belief on you. They wouldn't either. As a country we can only grow upwards of we set aside our differences to work together. Both are in the right. And both are in the wrong. Trust is a two way street. And we have to meet halfway for this to work. Otherwise all that remains will be mutual distrust, and that will be harmful to the potential greatness of this country as a land for inclusiveness and harmony, not not as a ground for distrust and despair. 

EDIT: People might say why I speak about Hinduism extensively, but as the predominant faith of the region, it has a responsibility towards other beliefs, which is why it matters.",bykuvn,,false,/r/india/comments/bykuvn/caught_between_animosities_india_is_increasingly/,Non-Political

I brushed it off thinking it's just some violation of offer code. 

But turns out there are lots of customers who have been lied to, on their f***ing face by coolwinks. 

They all have call recordings where the customer representative confirms the applicability of the offer and assures them about cash back. Some dude even spent ₹5800, believing the customer rep!!

Now, after the return window is closed (according to offer terms, cash back in bank account is credited after return window gets closed), coolwinks denies the offer.

And the link to the forum where consumer complaints about coolwinks scam is in multiples of tens. 

Oh yes, I spent around 2k falling for the assurance by the customer care but unfortunately I haven't recorded the calls. Initiated a return request but there are multiple complaints about their return policy scams where the company doesn't return money at all. 


And these buggers are sponsors of an IPL team!!!!


* Now my question is, can the consumers collectively do anything about this? Because a company is clearly lying to the customers on their face, inducing them to buy products and now they deceive them with some random bs. 

* How to make more customers get awareness of this? (These offers are still active on their website)

* how to get attention of some kind of media who can expose this and save lot of money of the consumers?

I don't mean to discourage you but there are things other than AI/ML that you have to learn. Do not have great pride if you used Tensorflow to ""make a machine learning model"" and don't call yourself an ML engineer. If you don't know the math, don't know how shit works, then shut up. Learn and then call yourself a ML scientist or ML Engineer. EVERYBODY knows how much of an ""ML Engineer"" you are in second year of engineering.

It is pissing off looking at how great these people think they are because they could build something that classifies a cat and a dog or some similar thing from a Udemy / Udacity course. Below is my fuckall rant about these fuckall people. If you care to read.

So, my company got on some bandwagon to include student developers and shortlisted people only on resume. Neither did I ask nor did I want any interns, but I was given interns. Now, I have no clue how skilled these people are and what they know. I work odd hours and am usually busy, but I wanted to give these people a platform.  Obviously I can't expect or give them production code to debug or fix, so I had to basically create tasks for them. I didn't have the chance to even speak to one of them before hiring, but I was told that they were told the role would involve Java and JUnit Testing. 

The first day, I wanted to just know how much they know and asked them basic OOPs questions and even without attempting to answer the questions, 8/10 people ask me why they're being asked Java stuff and why can't they be given ML stuff because they've experience. There is scope for ML in my team, but I can't trust students with the kind of data we work with and there are actual ML engineers who've been working in this field working on problems. 

I didn't know what they expected, so I told them to get started with writing JUnit test cases for some of our prototypes or they could start working on some internal prototype application in any framework of their choice. Either way, it was either testing or app / web development. No fancy ML stuff. I assigned them a mentor to approach for any doubts they have.

Before the end of the day, I had 4 emails requesting for a 1-on-1 meeting. I talk to them and its the same shit again. They want to do ML work and they're practically demanding I assign them ML work because they know there is ML work. I tell them that the data we work with can not be shared that easily and that they were not interviewed for this. But still, they're telling me how every company outside is offering ML work and we are giving the ""dirty"" work to interns. I tell them I'll see what can be done and told them I'll get back by Monday. The feedback from their mentor is that they don't know how to code anything in Java. Anything, at all. He gave them basic debugging tasks and they have no clue how to use a debugger. They don't know any of the design patterns. They know nothing but they want to do ML stuff, even when they were clearly told that they'd be working with Java or JUnit. I even made an exception to give them other projects because they didn't do java in college in depth and offered to provide them Java training (which is very relevant and paid for by the company with certification), but they still want to do ML.

Until here, is fine. I have dealt with a lot of people like this because I keep talking to university students. Where I totally lost it was, today I get a call from the father of one of the interns. He is in the senior management in some other company and he is asking me what is wrong in giving his talented son ML jobs. He then proceeds to tell me how the generation has changed, nobody uses Java and ML is the future and all. At this point, everything is looking like a meme come true. But this guy is serious. This guy thinks, if you can copy paste code and get something running, you can do ML stuff everywhere.

Seriously, if you are a university student and one of these ""ML/DL/AI/Blockchain/NN/XYZ Enthusiasts"", either find an internship that is specific to that area or don't be so rigid. The world is much more bigger than your small bubble and nobody owes you anything. Its not like there are surplus jobs that you can demand these things at such a junior level and learn to be humble. That thing pays off more than any of your worthless Youtube certifications.

A few months ago I had approached this sub for help. I was in final year of my BCA and due terrible financial situation at home, I was unable to pay my final year fees on time. The college didn't help much. Banks wouldn't provide loan in middle of the course. Savings had run dry and there seemed no other way to come out of the situation. I approached this sub tp loan me 40-50k in exchange of freelancing work. However within few hours, not only had this community help me setup a crowd funding campaign but also raised 50k for my fee, and I kept receiving messages from humble randians still offering me financial assistance if I needed more.

The support from the community helped me pay my college fee on time. And I have cleared my BCA course on time thanks to this community, and generous people it consists of.

As for my life, I have joined a startup as full-stack engineer, though very very far from 1.6LPM™️ dream, but inshallah we will be there some day soon :D

I have also taken admission in distance MCA course, so that I can give UGC exam later. On weekends I volunteer to code stuff for this non-profit which is promoting use of RPis in remote communities, and introduction of Raspberry Pi in schools in remote area.

I have also taken ""wise"" decision to invest in life insurance, health insurance, and put my savings in equity and debt based MFs. I hope /r/IndiaInvestments will be proud of me :P

Just browse for phones or most electronics and mechanical stuff like clocks or watches There is a pretty good chance one of the top reviews is a one star saying that the delivered thing was defective or fake.

I perfectly understand that you feel shitted on and it is agreed that it is their fault. 

So just write as many ragey emails as you want complaining about it. You are entitled to and should fully utilize your privilege as a consumer/customer.

You can most of the time ask for a free return and re-delivery which is mostly completed within 3-4 days even if you don't have amazon prime or flipkart assurance.

YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO REVIEW THE PRODUCT NOT THE DELIVERY GUY OR COMPANY. REVIEWS ARE WRITTEN SO THAT YOU CAN HELP OTHERS MAKE A BETTER CHOICE.

Repeat that in your head.

You are reviewing the product. Just because your 1 in 1000 piece was defective doesn't mean that the product is shit.

Get a re-delivery , use it and then review it so that you can actually help other people . Just because you got a fake/defective doesn't mean I would be facing the same.

It is mostly to be honest 1 in a 1000 that you got a fake or defective one. There are 999 other people who ordered it and are perfectly enjoying themselves.",c0ztiq,,false,/r/india/comments/c0ztiq/if_you_get_a_defective_or_fake_product_from/,Non-Political

Writing this for more clarity (copy pasting comments -mine and another user comment)

Why?

1. If the guy is an obsessive one (I'm not saying you are, I am just outlining the fears), he might stalk, threaten, or in extreme cases even pour acid on her face. 
2. She might be branded prude, uptight etc. 
3. She might get constant messages from the guy if she says a no (i don't know why but guys seem to take it like a personal challenge if a girl says no)
4. Her friendship with the guy might be affected, and she still wants the person as a friend. 
5. Some guys turn completely hateful if a girl says no. They bitch about her to other guys, send her hateful messages etc. So to protect her peace. 

Source: I told a guy no more than ten years back and I got messages even last year after I had blocked him everywhere tired of harrassment.. Also every girl I know has some version of the above points.

My story. 

(12 years)
He initially asked me in 10th. I said no many times. After going to college I dismissed it (I mean kids have crushes) But no. Dude pesters me again. I again say no. 

This on off things continues. Then last year he somehow texted me, saying he wants to marry me, will ask my hand to parents etc.

I was so terrified I just blocked him again. 



A comment in response to mine:

&gt;5. Some guys turn completely hateful if a girl says no. They bitch about her to other guys, send her hateful messages etc. So to protect her peace. 


Yikes. Been on the receiving end of this recently. And boy oh boy! Did he lose it? The way he reacted, you would think something snapped inside him. It was like he came undone, and suddenly I was dealing with this vitriol-spewing piece of a shit who would twist every single thing he knew about me in the most grotesque way possible to try and get back at me, all because he got turned down. I still can't for the life of me fathom how fucked does someone have to be inside to be that bitter. Never in a million years would I have ever imagined he had this side to him. 

Suffice to say that I have learners my lesson since this incident. Saying no? Never again.

&lt;Comment end&gt;


For men it is a question of love life. For us it is a question of life. 

The first reaction to a request from a guy is fear (if the girl is not interested). Is he going to stalk? Is he going to threaten me? Is he going to ruin my reputation? 

So we prefer keeping quiet because silence is better than saying no and earning his wrath. 

If a girl does not say a yes, then most likely it is a no and you need to let go.

This is also why we prefer saying 'I have a boyfriend' even if we don't have because men respect other men more than they respect us. 

Please stop blaming women for not saying no...we do not have a choice. It is a huge risk for us.

Edit: I thought of adding this after some comments.

I have only written about the possibility where the girl does not like the guy. She may resort to a direct no/silence/lies because of all these reasons. 

I don't know why it should be taken as 'girls should propose then' and 'I will not propose anymore'. 

The girl would say yes if she's interested in you (unless she is playing hard to get-in which case you need to introspect whether you need that kind of girl in your life)...

And no,most girls are not going to take the initiative and ask guys out (again because of the risk factor). 

I know this is a depressing post, but I wanted to highlight why it is scary to say a no.

Edit 3: Many thanks for the gold, kind stranger. Didn't expect that. 

Also to clarify on point 4. 

I have written it as a reason why girls do not say no. I haven't said that it is a right thing to do.

Also this is not a post about boys vs. girls or men vs. women. This is simply to highlight a risk that is very relevant specially here. While the same thing happens globally we cannot ignore that the magnitude is higher in India. 

Majority of women go through this and that's what I wanted to say.",byttys,,false,/r/india/comments/byttys/why_we_dont_say_no_to_guys_proposals/,Non-Political

&amp;#x200B;

I went to my family tout (yes, guilty here!) thinking it would be

1. done seamlessly
2. cost me 3x at best

&amp;#x200B;

But what I was not aware of is that despite paying 6x of what it would have cost me had I gone through the legit route, I got zero convenience. I was made to visit the office THRICE! The guy behind the counter was meaning to make more trouble for me by saying the only passport would be admissible as address proof, but then I relented and forced him to either accept my Voter ID for address proof OR state to me in writing with his name that the ID is not acceptable. He then realized it is not his day to mess with me further and let it go.

The tout as well was incompetent - didn't know of most intricacies or was unwilling to make it any easier for us. And his service charge itself was 1.5k. I had to take 2 half days from work and visit the place THRICE, because sometimes either some new affidavit has to be made or even better, Digital India's server connectivity got lost! #FML!

So, what should have cost me 500 rupees at best, cost me over 3k. And took me a span of 2 days and several hours waiting in the line in this heat JUST to get my marriage certificate. As an honest tax paying citizen, I am not just disgruntled, I am sad what this country has become.

&amp;#x200B;

For me, India lost today - Sometimes, I wonder if we would have been in a better place under British rule.

\[End of RANT\] 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR - Went to do a govt job done, took me 6x the legit price and 2 days without even buying me any convenience.

EDIT - I am aware I was at fault for not having explored the online option myself. I accept that. But regardless, the experience left much to be desired and it could certainly have been less painful.",byxzhz,,false,/r/india/comments/byxzhz/rant_rotten_indian_system_marriage_certificate/,Non-Political

My phone's screen got broken so i was lurking around for a while until i made up my mind to fix it. I made an appointment from a popular company who also has the business of purchasing used electronics. At around 1 PM in the afternoon, a guy possibly in his 20's came and knocked my door. I let him inside, asked if he wanted a glass of water to which he politely said no , i was little embarrassed as it was shockingly hot outside. He came and fixed my screen within an hour and while rebooting to check if the screen had any defects noticed that i had installed a custom version of Android, increasingly not used to him seeing a regular customized version of android of the now popular smartphone brands. It immediately attracted him and he after finishing the work asked what it was and how it was done. After an hour and a half, i ended up giving him the copies of the OS, the boot-loader unlocker and the custom recovery along with a text document with the complete instructions. At up-to this point everything was alright.

During the conversation i happened to ask him what he was doing. He explained he was a engineering student and due to financial issues had taken up this job. I got little worried and asked how he was able to manage studies as well as doing this job. He explained that he had spoken to his principal and had got a special permission to do this. Much of his friends were possibly studying or loitering around in their motorcycles \[As that is observed during the last two years of engineering\] but he was actually going through a lot at this stage of his life.

I was really taken aback by this youth's life as much of our youths, including grown-ups spend most of their time on their smartphones, amazed and quite (used to) to the fact that everything is at their fingertips now. My mom used to humor us by saying ""Stop scratching the screen, come do some work"". It does seem funny though. What we all obviously miss out including me is that there is a lot of human effort which is spent in the background so that we all could utilize these services. I mean like gone are the days when we used to run to the nearest shop to get a packet of sugar (that too as a credit) because a relative just arrived out of nowhere.

Its incredible to mention that the most popular food delivery service asks us to keep a glass of cold water ready, if the sun beams too high - just to make sure their employees are cared (and are hydrated).",byy3fg,,false,/r/india/comments/byy3fg/humanity_checkscreen_replacement/,Non-Political

I was locked inside a dark storage facility with my classmates. It was suffocating inside  the facility,  we kept weeping but the vice principal ordered the guard to keep us locked in. I don't recall what happened after that, but years later I saw him again in a shop with my father. I didn't have the courage to tell all this to my father and point out the person responsible for my childhood trauma. I do realize that my school has the right of taking any disciplinary action, but this was more of a torture. Well it's all in the past now, it still haunts me

&gt;Travancore takes its name from the Travancore Mansion and Estate, a property owned by Henry Madden. Madden purchased the property, previously Flemington House, from the relatives of Hugh Glass in 1906 and renamed the property. Henry exported horses to India (hence the property is named after the Indian state of Travancore present day city of Trivandrum).[3] When the land around Travancore Mansion was sub-divided, many of the streets were named in keeping with the Indian theme, such as Lucknow Street, Bengal Street, Cashmere Street and Mangalore Street.[4] Many of the houses reflect the Old English architecture of the former Travancore region of India in the state of Kerala.

The people in these shows either are gangsters or live a life in gated communities, talk in English ( haa mujhe pata hai ye line kaafi hypocritical lag rahi h) or they just kill each other and abuse all the time.
Shows like made in heaven,four more shots Mirzapur are one of the few examples from the lot. And Don't even start on the god awful sex mania shows of Alt Balaji, no surprise as Ekta Kapoor. These people are worried about hookups and not getting reservation in their favourite restaurants. Where is the show about a lower middle class family where everything is chaotic on daily basis but still somehow goes on, where you forget even hook-ups if you get caught by your parents talking to someone of opposite gender there are fucked up consequences.

""During the Cold War, if USA launched a nuke-loaded missile, Soviet Satellites would inform the Soviet army in 3 seconds and in less than 45 seconds Soviet counter-missiles would be on their way. Recent studies commissioned by US department of Defense included one on nuclear war between India and Pakistan.

This was the scenario

The Pakistan army decides to launch a nuke-missile towards India. They don't need any permission from their government, and promptly order the countdowns.

Indian technology is highly advanced. In less than 8 seconds, Indian army detects the Pak countdown and decides to launch a missile in retribution.But they need permission from the Government of India.They submit their request to the Indian President. The President forwards it to the Cabinet. The Prime Minister calls an emergency Lok Sabha session.The LS meets, but due to several walkouts and severe protests by the opposition, it gets adjourned indefinitely.

The President asks for a quick decision.

In the mean time, the Pak missile failed to take off due to technical failure. Their attempts for a re-launch are still on.Just then the Indian ruling party is reduced to a minority because a party that was giving outside support withdraws it. The President asks the PM to prove his majority within a week.As the ruling party fails to win the confidence vote, a caretaker government is installed.The caretaker PM decides to permit the armed forces to launch a nuclear missile. But the Election Commission says that a caretaker government cannot take such a decision because elections are at hand.The Election Commission files Public Interest Litigation in the Supreme Court alleging misuse of power.The Supreme Court comes to the rescue of the PM, and says the acting! PM is authorized to take this decision in view of the emergency facing the nation.

Just then one of the Pak missiles successfully took off, but it fell 367 miles away from the target, on its own government building in Islamabad at 11.00 AM.Fortunately there were no casualties as no employee had reached the office that early. In any case, the nuclear core of the missile had detached somewhere in flight.The Pakistan army is now trying to get better technologies from China and USA. The Indian Government, taking no chances, decides to launch a nuclear missile of its own, after convening an all-party meeting.

This time all the parties agree.Its three months since the army had sought permission. But as preparations begin, ""pro-humanity"", ""anti-nuclear"" activists come out against the Government's decision. Human chains are formed and Rasta rokos organized.In California and Washington endless e-mails are sent to Indians condemning the government and mentioning ""Please forward it to as many Indians as possible"".

On the Pakistan side, the missiles kept malfunctioning. Some missiles deviate from target due to technical failures or high-speed wind blowing over Rajasthan.

Many of them land in the Indian Ocean killing some fishes.

A missile (smuggled from USA) is pressed into service. Since the Pakistan army is unable to understand its software, it hits it original destination: Moscow. Russians successfully intercepts the missile and in retaliation launches a nuclear missile towards Islamabad. The missile hits the target and creates havoc. Pakistan cries for help.

Now that India’s population is around 4 times bigger than where it was in ‘43, **I’m extremely concerned for my countrymen’s water security.** 

Here are my questions:

* Are politicians to blame for this, and did they not prepare for something like this?
* What can India do to prevent this next time?
* Are Indians wasteful of how they use their water?
* Would the crops be impacted adversely?

* After 18 weeks since the launch of Spotify India, ""Señorita by Shawn Mendes"" became the first song to cross the 1 million streams mark on the weekly charts, gaining over 1.54 million streams in the week of 27/06/2019 almost double to the no. 2 song on the chart.

* Previously the most streamed song was ""Boy With Luv by BTS"" having 584,721 streams achieved in the week of 18/04/2019 (Week 8) which broke the previous record of ""Sucker by Jonas Brothers"" which had 462,195 streams in the week of 07/03/2019 (Week 2, first full week).

**More stats**

* Currently ""Bekhayali by Sachet Tandon"" holds the record of most weeks at no. 1 topping the charts for 4 consecutive weeks since it's debut only to be dethroned last week. It also blocked ""You Need to Calm Down by Taylor Swift"" to reach no. 1 spot in its 3rd week on the chart.

* ""Bekhayali"" also holds the record of most streams in a single week by any hindi song. It got 772,838 streams in its 4th week on the chart.

* ""Duniya by Akhil"" has managed to stay in top 10 of the charts for 18 consecutive weeks peaking at no. 1 in its 11th week with 280,383 streams and getting most streams in its 17th week with 345,686 streams.



P.s: The 1 million mark could have broken before by Ed Sheeran's song "" I don't care"" w/ Justin Bieber as it performed very well on Spotify worldwide and seeing the popularity of Ed and Justin in India but alas it was not available on Spotify India due to the dispute w/ WMG.",c7c8dt,,false,/r/india/comments/c7c8dt/señorita_by_shawn_mendes_becomes_the_first_song/,Non-Political
1561915202,sangupta637,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c7h0c9/upi_is_shamefully_slow_unreliable_and_poorly/,11,14,,,"Upi is shamefully slow, unreliable and poorly implemented. Dont use it for anything more than to pay chai wala.","&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: For anything over 1k, stick to the debit card. No PayTM and definitely no UPI

&amp;#x200B;

UPI is very poorly implemented. When you pay using UPI,  there are 7 parties involved (instead of just 2): payee PSP, payee bank UPI manager, payee bank (may not be same as previous one),  NPCI/UPI,  payer bank UPI manager, payer Bank, payer PSP.  What's more fun, is they all communicate asynchronously over https. Never understood the logic. That makes UPI 2x slower. So in effect, payment using PayTM would be 14 times faster than UPI, which is quite demonstrable.

But I am really fine with it being slow, as long as it is reliable. The area where UPI fails miserably. Transactions aren't atomic. If I pay someone, either transaction should be **completely successful** or **completely failed**. What is not acceptable is one of debit and credit failing and other passing or passing some times later. 

Following is where I sent my sister INR 10k. Money debited instantly but no credit into my sister's account. I sent 10k again which was successful. Next day I got the notification that my transaction was successful. So now my sister had 20k. Its fine since money was with my sister. 

Today I booked a flight ticket with cleartrip.  Paid 7k using google pay. The same story again. Amount debited instantly, google pay is unsure of what happened \[screenshot\]. Cleartrip never got any money \[screenshot\]. No ticket. I dont know what to do? Do I book again? 

I am not against UPI. But it's just too poorly designed. Too many partied involved even in the simplest transaction (ex: payment to the same bank). Not failsafe. Fails too often for larger payments. A payment system should be reliable. What's surprising is that  its build on the top of existing payment system (forgot the  name). Which was incredibly fast and successful.  


PS: I use UPI since I lost my debit card. I can't use PayTM since it requires KYC and my quota is over.

1559980172,acemachine26,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/by5mfp/another_eid_down_memory_lane_my_fathers_writeup/,38,173,,,Another Eid down memory lane: My father's write-up for Eid and the struggles of Indians living in the Middle East,"It is Eid today in Oman and the beginning of a week’s holidays. Me and Lakshmi got up early and were ready by 5 AM to go for a jog. When we got down to the road, the first thing we saw was, the Indian man, a sweeper from Baladiya (Municipality) who usually cleans trash in our area, is opening his wallet and giving some money to two kids. It’s a custom in the middle east, on Eid (celebration), elders give money to kids, to buy sweets and gifts. It's like, in Kerala, during Vishu (a festival) our people give ‘Vishu Kaineettam’ (a gift in the form of money) to kids, to buy firecrackers and sweets. I was surprised, that this poor guy (we all know that the income of a municipal road cleaner is very low) was happily giving his hard-earned money to some unknown kids, although he himself must be struggling to save even 100 baiza.

When we were (me and my wife) discussing the magnanimous attitude of the cleaner, my memory went back decades. During our days in Abu Dhabi, I was working for a pharma company and my wife for a bank. Both our kids were born and brought up there. We have an elder son and a younger daughter. I or my wife will drive the kids to school. In those days, newspapers were sold at a traffic signal, in UAE. Although we could get it delivered at home, directly from the publisher, I preferred to buy it from someone standing at the signal. Because, they stand in the harsh sun, to make a living. So, it will be a help for them. Also buying the paper daily, created a rapport with the paperboy (although he may be in his 40s). I used to buy Khaleej Times daily and on weekends Gulf News, as they have a very good weekend magazine (Friday Magazine). Always my 4-year-old son will be sitting on the back seat, while I am buying the paper. The paper boy always chit chat with my son, when I stop. If my son is not there, for whatever reason, he will ask with concern, where is my little friend? What happened to him? Etc.

It was a holiday, but I was taking my son to clarinet classes and stopped to buy our usual newspaper. The paperboy came running and threw the paper on the front seat and ran around the car. He requested me to pull down the back window. He gave 2 or 3 UAE dirham coins to my son. My son looked at me in confusion. I was thinking, what the heck? Why this guy giving money to my kid? I told politely, ‘Brother, it's not required. You are struggling, to make money all your life, in this heat. Why you have to give money to my kid? He looked at me pathetically and said, “Sir, please don’t say that! Kindly accept this. It is Eid today. I also have a kid in India. He was like your son, when I left him 5 years back. Now he must be big. Do not know when I can see him again. In this Eid, I cannot give him money or a gift. When I give this ‘Eedi’ (Eid gift) to this kid, I feel like, I am giving my son “. By the time he said that, his eyes were over flowing. I told my son to accept the money and thank that kind man. In those days, the newspaper was sold for UAE Dhs.1/- daily. The paperboy may be getting 10 or 15% commission for each paper he sold. So, he has to sell at least a dozen newspapers, to earn the price of a newspaper. So, he spent what he earned by selling 2 or 3 dozen newspapers, to give Eedi to my son. How kind-hearted is he! I noticed many times; poor people are more compassionate and kind-hearted than the rich ones. I felt a sort of respect and attachment to that gentleman, from that day. Whenever I had a chance, I gave him some gift in one pretext or other.

Now my son is abroad and finished his University this month. He may not know that today is Eid in this part of the world and may not remember that uncle, who gave him Eid gift. But how can I forget that paperboy. I used to see that gentleman for many years. Then eventually paper sales were banned at the traffic signals and time flew as usual and we have moved on to different countries. Hope that paper boy has settled down in India and his son is looking after him well. It's not the money you have, or the blood relations that you have, but the human emotions you share with each other, that makes you happy and leaves a mark in our lives.

Talking about men who are forced to live bachelor lives in the Middle East (as per GCC rules, your salary should be good enough to live with family as rent and schooling are expensive and only people with certain professions are allowed to bring families), another story comes to my mind. My daughter was studying in ILA (Kinder Garten, run by Indian Ladies Association) Abu Dhabi in those days. I used to drop her at school and my wife used to pick her up, when she returns from the bank. Most of the days, my wife will pack breakfast for the kid. But some days, when she is late for work or nothing is available, to make a quick breakfast, she will tell me, “Madhu, please grab something, on the way, for Gopi, to eat at school”. At the corner, before the school, there was one ‘Arab Udupi’ vegetarian hotel. They made nice breakfast and other typical Indian snacks. As idly is cooked in steam and its good for kids’ health, I used to buy it usually. Also, our daughter loved the idly with the coconut chutney. Sometimes when we reach the restaurant, they will be just warming their cooker and the manager requests us to sit and wait, while idly is being cooked. While waiting he will give a fried snack or a sweet to the kid. So, she loved going to Arab Udupi. He will pack the idly and chutney nicely and give it to my daughter, saying, “I made it special for you”. While waiting for the idly, to get ready, we will chit chat about our families. Once I asked about his family and kids. Suddenly he went in to silence and I did not insist on an answer. After some days, he told me, sir I am leaving this job, I am going back to Mangalore (in India). I felt sad, as if I am losing a good friend. I asked him, why? What happened? Any problem with your job. He suddenly looked tired; he started saying, “You asked me about my kids and family some days back. I did not answer you, at that time. You know I had only one son. He was a very good boy; he studied well and finished his 12th with a good grade. He wanted to be an Engineer and got admission to a good college. I was hoping, he will soon, become an engineer and I can retire and go and live with my family. He wanted a two-wheeler, to go to college. Somehow, I managed the funds and bought a new bike for him. On the way back from university, one day, a drunk lorry driver lost control and hit my son’s bike and he lost his life, on the spot. I and my wife were devastated. I couldn’t stay at home, thinking about my son all the time. I came back running, thinking, that, while being busy at work, I can forget my sorrows. Maybe I was trying to escape from my worries. My wife was all alone at home, brooding over our son. Recently she developed some mental issues. I do not want to lose her also. I am going back and look after her. She needs me badly and I need her, to feel that, I am not alone in this world. Otherwise, there is no meaning in life. I didn’t know what to say, how much sorrow people are suffering. I just hugged him and left, without a word. If I say something, I may start crying, like a baby. Seeing my somber mood, my daughter asked me, what happened dad, why that uncle was crying and there are tears in your eyes? What can I tell this little angel? We just drove in silence.

In India, most people think that, all those who work in the Gulf are rich and make a lot of money. The reality is that, most of them are struggling to make ends meet and fall into a vicious circle. They cannot enjoy their lives, cannot bring their families or go to India frequently, to be with their families. The money they make will not be enough, even to meet bare necessities of life and the unending demands that come from family, back home, push them to live a life of poverty and sacrifice all happiness, for the sake of their family. Some of them are lucky, if their kids value their struggle and give them back, the love and care they deserve, in their old age. Many of them go back with a very sick body and mutilated mind and will be ignored by the same people, for whom they wasted their lives for.

I am super skinny and have been getting weaker (almost blacked out in the gym a couple of weeks ago). Want to figure out how to eat healthy on an ok budget, preferably easy too cook desi food because I miss that shit.

&amp;#x200B;

I am 21M weigh like 45 kgs and live in Canada. This has been affecting me a lot recently. I have already checked out  /r/fitness  (primarily posts about losing weight) and /r/gainit which seemed to care a lot more about muscles (I am fine with having no muscles, just want some fat tbh)

&amp;#x200B;

Looking for what worked for you? 

Any tips on forcing myself to eat more? I am terrible at eating breakfast.

Any ez to cook desi food suggestions? I looked into meal prep but difficult to find desi meal prep that actually works.",bydx42,,false,/r/india/comments/bydx42/how_do_i_not_be_so_skinny_and_undernourished/,Non-Political

Mum asked him why on Earth he wanted an elephant, and he said, 'Because, dear lady, I wish to keep him in my olive grove and watch the patterns of shadows the moonlight makes through the twigs on his back.' The Air India staff thought he was joking. ""But he was serious,"" says Gidwani, laughingly. ""Air India flew a two-year-old elephant from Bangalore, accompanied by a mahout (keeper), to Geneva. The elephant (Big Baby) was trucked to Cadaqués, where it was personally received by me and cleared through customs at 3 am. The mahout then guided the elephant to Dali’s house.""",c1kujp,,false,/r/india/comments/c1kujp/til_salvador_dali_designed_a_surrealist_ashtray/,Non-Political

Nowhere Station is the name of their band and IMO they are one of the finest bands in the country today. They are a group of architects and one planner and they have also won the North east festival rock competition last year. 

Here are a few songs of theirs

However it came to my attention that the revived series which started in 2016 hasn't made its way there yet. 90's kids loved the show and it's a great show for a whole family to sit and watch together. So tweet your broadcasters and networks, let them know the 90s classic is back. And who knows, America are making their own version of it now, why can't there be another international version? 

All it would take is the right employee at a TV network, who remembers the show from their childhood, to see it and start the ball rolling.

I'm using US version because it is simply better. Open for recommendations and suggestions.

Michael Scott - Govinda (would be a perfect fit as he can be cringy, weird, and funny all at the same time.)

Jim Halpert - Sidharth Malhotra (not sure about his expressions but manageable).

Pam Beesly - Sara Ali Khan (perfect fit. Can easily portray an adorable girl-next-door).

Dwight Schrute - Pankaj Tripathi (quite possibly the most complex character, so we need one of the best).

Phyllis Vance - Seema Bhargava

Angela Martin - can't quite land on her. (Although Alia Bhatt and Sonam Kapoor came to mind).

Oscar Martinez - Kaiyoze Irani (Minority, as he's Parsi. A faboulus actor too).

Kelly Kapoor - Elli Avram (with a european name).

Stanley Hudson - Brahmanandam (a walk in the park for the legendary comedian).

Ryan Howard - supposed to be young, ambitious, handsome and cunning a-hole. Can't land on that too (thought of Varun Dhawan, but too many star kids already).

Toby Flenderson - ....

Kevin Malone - Nirmal Soni from TMKOC ( their faces match too).

Creed Bratton - Nana Patekar (playing one of the shadiest guys in the world is a cup of tea for Nana sir).

As of now, I've just thought of the main cast. You can suggest more and recommend on the existing.",c1t6dc,,false,/r/india/comments/c1t6dc/my_cast_list_if_the_office_got_remade_in_bwood/,Non-Political

As it may be, this is quite a big move for me and its causing a mild amount of anxiety.

Due to the way I am, I tend to worry a lot about small and mundane things which after talking to someone tend to die out. Apart from the usual stuff about moving like apartment and roomates, finding hobbies and friends, trivial things like how will I do the laundry?, will I get an internet connection?, where will I buy the furniture if needed? tend to cause me worry.

This all may be due to the fact that I haven't done them ever and after moving I may find myself at ease but nevertheless I'm worried right now. One more thing, I believe I may have mild Asperger's Syndrome which I haven't been able to diagnose medically but I find similar traits in me which I guess is the cause for worry over this small stuff.  

With all that said, is this normal? Will I be able to function properly there? And any advice you all have? 

Thank You!",c16z0l,,false,/r/india/comments/c16z0l/moving_away_from_home_for_first_time/,Non-Political

1. Patients think medical science is fucking magic.  They think you can revive any person, even if they are literally in the most diseased state. CPR is NOT MAGIC.  Only 26% patients survived in US till hospital discharge.  This is for hospital CPR and this is America.  You expect magic in India where we are severely understaffed and govt hospitals have no supplies?  As for. Diagnosis,  it's not magic lol.  No. Diagnosis is 100% fixed.  If. You don't like these uncertainties ( reality. kehte h isse),  then don't take treatment please. 

2. The biggest hypocrisy - DoCtoRS shoULD sErVe for POor and they TaKe too MucH FEES. 

Yeah...  Well sorry to say,  we aren't charity.  Healthcare is an essential service but is NOT charity.  Nor is it a 100% guarantee service.  It is like a court case where you have to pay. Your lawyer who is fighting for you even if you lose the case.  Why is it so?  Because we are using our hard earned skills for providing as better of care as we can.  You get a lawyer by state too like you get healthcare in govt hospitals.  But if you want more,  you have to give more. 

But NO lol,  it's the doctors who will suffer.  And on the topic of fees....  Why don't you guys...  you know.. give YOUR monthly salary to the poor people/charity?  Aren't you humans?  So yeah,  don't be a HYPOCRITE AND SAY THAT ONLY. ONE SECTION SHOULD SERVE. 

You are basically dropping the responsibility to the doctors by saying they should serve and not you lol.  Chal. Be,  aisa nahi chalta.  If you guys can. Donate. For taking care of. Our family. And hobbies ( as doctors are humans as well!),  then we will work. For free. 

3. Finally...  You can't get healthcare of international level in India with free. 

Bro kabhi America Jake rate dekha healthcare. ka.  It's HIGH but people complaining their dont complain of doctors.  They say it's government which should do for it.  The difference is clear as sky and hell. 


This. Country doesn't deserve the service. of healthcare,  which had made such improvements to the miserable. Conditions this country had at time of Independence.  Many of.

Everyone LOVES Steve Carell as Michael Scott, and The Office (US) will forever remain a treasure. When the promos for The Office (India) came out, I decided to remain positive among all the haters. The fact remains that even The US Office did terrible in its first season, trying to emulate the UK original. It's only after the 2nd season, where they tweaked it to their humor that it grew into one of the best shows ever.

So coming to the Indian one. I patiently waited until midnight for the show to drop and fired it up immediately. Here are some impressions. For people who have never seen The Office (US) these will be SPOILERS. For the fans of the show, these will be inside jokes. (I'd love to be a part of one someday)

&amp;#x200B;

1. They used a new title track and quite frankly, it is meh. Maybe a Scranton 7.
2. Indian Pam is cute af. Great casting. Also, her name is .... wait for it.. Pammi! (Identity theft is not a joke!)
3. Desi Toby is annoying af. Because he overacts to the moon. OG Toby was annoying because he hardly emoted. This guy toh bhai. NO GOD NO!
4. Jagdeep Chadda aka Desi Michael Scott does a really good job! He's not tried to be Michael Scott and this works for him.
5. Oscar is a great cast as well! I'm only like 90% sure of this though, but I believe Oscar in the Indian version is a guy named Chinchin, who looks like he's from the North East but is actually from Karkardooma, East Delhi (there's a pretty funny scene in the second episode, **Diversity Day**). Again, I'm not entirely sure this is Oscar (he isn't wearing fabulous, bright-colored clothes you know) but it does fit the bill!
6. Remember how they changed the title track? Well, everything else is pretty much a straight-up carbon copy from the US show. The office layout, desi Phyllis who is always knitting. I wonder if Bob Vance is gonna be Bunty BlueStar, BlueStar refrigeration.
7. The episodes are 95% scene to scene remakes with the jokes tweaked for Indian audience. (Jello isn't a thing here, so Dwight's stapler is in something else) Having watched the US show easily over 10 times, I knew each scene before it took place.
8. \*\*Two of the shows longest standing and most memorable jokes, Asst to the regional Manager, and Thats What She Said (TWSS).\*\*I was very eager to see how they'd play Asst to the regional manager. I was very disappointed. It took me 2 takes to actually understand the indian version. i won't be surprised if you miss it the first time. TWSS hasn't turned up yet (only 2 epis down.) but big things usually take time. That's what she said.
9. This is my most favorite topic. Many have discussed how, if The Office (US) aired exactly today, it would face endless backlash for the blatant stereotyping, the misogyny, the racism (all by Michael Scott), and would never get more than 2 seasons in todays political climate. The Indian one is taking a huge gamble by repeating the same tropes. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely stand by it in the form of art. But I won't be surprised to see pitchforks and a Twitter Army assembling.

The incident in question occurred over a year ago, but I am posting now mainly because I am quitting this workplace soon. And I am interested to know what a larger audience thinks about this.

One of the women in the team I managed came to me one day, along with a male colleague (for moral support I guess), complaining about some HR policy (about number of hours to be worked everyday) being unfair to her. I was done with my workday and was on my way out, but stopped to listen. Turns out HR was quite right, and I told her as much. She then pointed out that HR should adjust any days where she worked less than the stipulated time with days where she worked beyond her shift. I had always told everyone in the team to not work beyond their shifts, because there was never any official reason to. So I reminded her of that, but she insisted with her argument.

So I told her the world is often not fair, and that companies will often pay you only for what they require you to do, and sometimes, extra effort goes unrewarded. She seemed to not comprehend, so I chose to give her an example, whose appropriateness you are free to judge. I said something along the lines of ""If your husband is really nice to you, bringing you flowers and gifts everyday, you will start taking it for granted. But the one day he is a dick to you, you will remember for the rest of your life.""

At this point, her male colleague laughed a little, she gave a nervous smile, and about 15 seconds later, they let me go my way to enjoy my Friday evening. This happened in a large hall type space, with lots of other people around. There was no physical contact of any kind, with us standing at least 5 feet apart.

Monday, I get an email from HR about an official complaint filed against me by the woman. A little bit confused, I asked for details and was told it was a complaint of sexual harassment. Having worked with her in the same office for over a year, I had never once said anything remotely sexual or flirtatious to her. Not just because it could have been construed as abuse of authority, but also because I didn't find her even remotely attractive in any way whatsoever, physically, mentally or any other-ly.

So I was quite shocked, and I don't even get surprised easily. I asked for specifics, and this is where it got comic.

In her complaint, she alleged I said she would ""never forget the days when your husband dicks you."" And that was the entire grounds for her allegation of sexual harassment against me.

For one, that's not even English. For two, even if it were English, it still wouldn't make any sense in the context in which it was said. For three, even if I had said those words devoid of any real meaning, I am not sure if it shows any intent on my part to harass her in any way, let alone sexually.

It is probably worth noting that her very job required writing web content in English.

How terribly HR handled the whole matter is another issue altogether. I had to tell them about the actual provisions of the POSH law, had to force them to set up a proper committee and actually investigate the matter properly before accusing me and demanding an apology to close up the whole matter. Till the end, it never actually happened properly. They never questioned anyone else about what happened, and just took that woman's word for granted.

In her complaint, the woman also brought up my disbelief in god and dislike for religion (because I once asked her why she and other people go to temples like Tirupati so often, and give away so much money to an already fabulously rich institution), my use of language with other people (as should be clear by my own quote above, I don't exactly stick to ""office"" lingo, but that is pretty standard in my industry), my supposed disregard for women (can't imagine where she got this from), and how all these things make me un-Indian (yes, all 1.25 billion of us in the country are the exact same kind of people), and she liberally sprinkled her rant with hashtags of MeToo and TimesUp. And HR seemed eager to believe her.

I should also point out that no other woman in the office, several of whom I had worked with more closely and longer, have ever had anything similar to say about me. Yes, I know there is always a first time for everything... but that's for things we actually do, not for things we never did.

Her reporting line was changed, for which I was glad too. And till this was sorted out, I was put on leave, which I wasn't glad for.

Eventually, it ended more than 3 weeks later when I insisted HR set up a proper committee as per the POSH law, said I would use provisions within that law to have her frivolous claim investigated and be taken action against, and also sue her separately for defamation. Suddenly, HR was eager to clear up the misunderstanding and all she wanted was an assurance that I don't use such language with her or with anybody else (culture policing sure knows no bounds). Her complaint was retracted, and I agreed to use polite language with her in the future (in practice, I just never spoke to her again).

The whole incident left a very bad taste in my mouth, not just because of what I had to go through (being wrongly accused of something like this, especially on the basis of such a bizarre complaint, and it actually being taken on face value by those responsible for investigating the accusation, is actually much harder than I had thought it would be) but also because of what I feel it does to the morale of women who actually face real problems of this kind, but could be hesitant to speak up for fear of not being believed. It is like the story of the boy who cried wolf, except the town starts to doubt all the boys who live there. Not just the boys, but the whole town suffers.

If I go for DU colleges, they don't have good placements after Bsc and one would have to go for masters like MBA/Ms in India or abroad.

It will not take more than 2 minutes of your time.,"I was cheated by a guy on OLX. Now, before you skip/downvote this post, please read till the end.

It's a classic case of advance post fraud. He demanded that I post the package first and send him the receipt, after which he would transfer the due ""within seconds"". When I sent him the receipt, he sent me a fake Paytm transaction photo (generated by an app available on internet). He kept insisting that he'd sent the money, so much so that for some time I thought maybe there was something wrong with my bank/app! Later, when asked him to send me a screenshot of his Paytm transaction history, he turned silent (because no app presently does that). By now, it was too late to get the package back.
 
By the way, I had talked to the guy prior to posting the package. He's a first year student and sounded genuine, and even asked my advice on an exam he wishes to take in future (I answered all his queries in detail).


Anyway, when I realized that I'd been scammed, for a little while, I lost all my faith in humanity. I didn't even want my money back. I turned off the phone and beat myself up for not being wary and vigilant enough (which I generally am, but I guess he got the best of me with his junior-student-talk).


The next day, I decided that I will not let him have his sweet victory. Maybe he has scammed many others before me and probably will scam many others in future. Maybe there was something I could do? It was as much about retribution as it was about preventing the same from happening to someone else.


Firstly, I reported him on olx and I believe he has been blocked. But that doesn't prevent him from making a new account. I couldn't let him go free.

So, I called him, expressed my hurt, and pretended to have forgiven him. He was still insistent on having sent the money. When I challenged him to send a screenshot of his transaction history, he began propping up irrelevant issues, like how he had no money, or that would send the money in ""a few days"" and so on. I hung up, because I was frustrated to the core and couldn't deal with him anymore.

The day after that, I created a story that I hoped would make him accept his fault.

I called him and said that I had a friend in Telangana (Rajoli - a four hour drive from his place), who would arrive at his place on Saturday. I made it clear that he would NOT demand money, but simply talk to his parents (remember that this guy is a kid) about how their son has been scamming people online and how that is an offence under various laws. I told him that this was no longer about money but about sending a message, about teaching him a lesson.

At this point, the smug tone of his voice changed and sounded like someone frightened. He propped up multiple excuses, like sending twice the amount in *n* days, being poor and having only 10 rupees, and so on. I don't believe a word of his.


He seemed, or was pretending to have learnt his lesson. In any case, there's not a lot I can/want to do about him.

The only thing that remains to do now, is to have my Telegu friend call him up, telling him that he is on the way to his address. The problem is, I have no Telegu friend.

And this is where I need your help, to put an end to this unfortunate incident. I know, petty revenge, but if you can spare two minutes of your time, it will help put my mind at peace, and possibly reform a kid's behavior.

Please DM me if you'd like to do the needful. It shouldn't take more than 2 minutes of your time.

My review after watching 4 Episodes","So the Office was just released, and the moment I realised this, I went over to Hotstar, and renewed my membership, (Last time I went over to hotstar subscription page so early, was to cancel my membership after Game of Thrones Ended.)

&amp;#x200B;

The show it self, is ok.

If you remember the US Office first season, you'll know that the show was still finding its soul.

&amp;#x200B;

In the same sense, the Indian version too is good, but very very predictable as it is a complete copy of the US version.

&amp;#x200B;

Now in this context, it is both, a good thing and a bad thing.

I cant go scene by scene, because I don't want to give much away, but if you are like me and reading this, it means you have already watched the US version about 10 times.

Each scene is a line by line remake, and I think the show maker are playing it safe.

***if it works don't fix it.***

At the end of the day, it is really important that they are respecting the source material, and not taking it for granted.

&amp;#x200B;

# Here's why People are hating it.

(actually people have been hating it ever since it was announced, a year ago)

1. Because we [love the show](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bvrayj/a_little_experiment_with_syncing_the_office_to/).
2. We are afraid they will *ekta-kapoorize (is that a word yet?) it.*
3. we suck at making copies, sometimes.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I will attempt to give you guys the reason to watch it.

1. Its the first season, give it time
2. The show is not ekta-kapoorized.

&amp;#x200B;

The casting is good as well,

* Pammi (Pam) is cute. follow her on instagram: dewan_e_sam. She has like 2000 followers.
* TP, (Dwight) is a pain in the ass (at first),
* Amit (Jim) Fits the role, he is young, charming, and *active.*
* Jagdeep Chadda (Michael) is a racist, ignorant, and in-considered,

you get the Idea

&amp;#x200B;

The actors are not trying to be exactly like the US cast. They are finding their own soul in the characters and it will take time.

# Things I can't wait to see

* Steve Carell making a guest appearance, like [Ricky Gervais did on US Office](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMNyDtib6Y4)
* TP arranging the Fire Emergency Drill.

# My Notes to Makers

Hey, guys, good job on the show, and I wish you all the best for the future.

I understand that you are under a lot of pressure here. but as a fan of the Us version, here's my suggestion, *no body asked for*.

Do not translate each and every line and Joke to Hindi for the sake of it. Please Be creative in every episode and people will love it.

You have something golden in your hand, Most people (not all) have seen the US version way more than its normal for any human being, and they (read: me) remember each and every dialogue by heart.

Don't be Predictable, be unique, and we will love you.

&amp;#x200B;

Almost all of the songs in the playlist were released in the last 20 years, with a majority of them being from the last decade or so (I'm a teenager, that's what I've grown up listening to).

Ordered a mobile with exchange offer from flipkart and the delivery person came today, inspected it and rejected it. It was a 2 year old 3t with no scratches or defects. The phone was working fine and infact I'm still currently using it, I was almost certain that it won't be rejected yet still they rejected it. It's almost like they expect you to give you fresh unboxed phones for exchange.

I don't think there's anything right with this film. There were some scenes that made me laugh because they were just so bad. Before watching the movie, I was rather curious about how bad could the movie really be, given the reviews that bashed it for 'toxic masculinity'. It is three hours of nonsense with no point and way too much misogyny. The dialogues are cringeworthy. It deserves all the negative reviews. I should have sat through Student of the Year 2 again than watch this piece of crap.

During the intermission, I heard someone say in the washroom 'Badha hi jaahil aadmi hai ye toh!' (translation: What a rude and uncivilised fellow he is!) Which is completely true. Kabir Singh is an idiot with some serious anger issues. I thought Bollywood couldn't get any worse, but it managed to exceed my expectations with this one. Did Shahid Kapoor not read the script? Did he not know what he was acting out? His performance was good, but I expected a better movie from him. Seriously, don't waste your money and time on this one, unless of course, you want to see how worse Bollywood can get.

Edit: And what the fuck is up with censor board? It is an A-rated movie for fuck's sake! Why mute some cuss words and ruin the experience! Fuck you so much, CBFC!",c3p802,,false,/r/india/comments/c3p802/psa_do_not_watch_kabir_singh/,Non-Political

I might post more in the the future.

My husband and I moved abroad immediately after we got married. I never really had the experience of living with his parents except for the short stays during our trips to India. They are visiting us for three months now and I just got a taste of how annoying in-laws can get. My husband is a great guy and knows where to draw the line and that’s I am glad that he calls them out for their unruly behaviour

So they arrived three days ago and my MIL snapped at me after making a few observations regarding the kind of relationship that I have with my husband.

My husband and I share all responsibilities equally. She feels that her baby (this is the exact term she used while yelling at me) is being burdened with cooking food and chores around the house. She also feels that him having to serve food and drinks to himself is my failure to be a good wife to him. According to her, I don’t respect him as a husband (my husband is my god concept).  Hubby told her to mind her own business and stay out of our matters.  He also told her that he is her son but not a baby anymore and babies don’t get married, men do.

On the day they arrived, we were going on with our usual fun banter and roast moments, she stepped in and started defending him and accused me of insulting him. My hubby told her to cut it out since we were having fun. Yesterday, he and I had a disagreement over a topic and had an argument which was not loud, she stepped in to save her son who was allegedly getting insulted. This time he flipped his lid and snapped at her badly for not minding her own business.

She got revenge on me by comparing me to herself and her older daughter in law and calling me a disgrace to the family. She said all these things today when my hubby was not around. Also, I was threatened with assault if I didn’t change my behavior towards him. I didn’t see this coming and I was in tears. I locked myself in my room and waited for my hubby since he was supposed to reach home in less than 30 minutes. I also sent him a message telling him to come to our room as soon as he is home so that we can talk. After we talked about it, he told me in private to not hesitate to call the police if they ever assault me. He openly told his mom to watch her words and to behave civil as long as they are here or they can leave if they intend to abuse or assault me.

She cried for an hour or two while blaming me for separating her from her son and turning him against her. I am being blamed for having a normal life with my man and somehow I ruined her life by poisoning the mom-baby bond. I am instructed to ignore her until she behaves appropriately. It is really awkward around the house now.",c3vj3h,,false,/r/india/comments/c3vj3h/mother_in_law_mil_snaps_at_me_for_not_attending/,Non-Political

*Review by HuffPost*

The review itself is quite brutal: 

&gt;If you were to put biceps on a middle-school history book, what you’d get is Salman Khan in Bharat. But don’t bother getting too creative with the imaginary book cover—Khan displays fewer expressions on his face than a blank A4 page.

&gt;	(On Priyanka Chopra) What woman gives up the chance to sing and dance around a man impersonating a block of wood to sing and dance with a man she actually wants to marry?

&gt;So, in the interests of adhering to the logic of Bhaizone, let’s examine how big Chopra’s loss is.

&gt;The film feels like being stuck on a date with a guy whose Tinder bio reads: JFK —&gt; DL—&gt;MUM—&gt;LA—&gt;HK—&gt;two dozen airport initials that plebs have to Google

&gt;	while you labour through your popcorn and patience, Bharat travels from Dubai to Somalia, saving people from gas leaks and pirates, in between making several white women dance to bhangra.

&gt;Halfway through the film, you’re left wondering why you’re being subjected to a Bhai edition of the History channel

&gt;It’s like the script had a single-line brief: Bhai ka biceps buddha nahin hona chahiye.

&gt;(On Katrina Kaif) She technically holds various jobs in the film — placement consultant, project manager at an oil rig, anchor, journalist — but her primary occupation is pining for Bharat.

&gt;	Imagine rejecting this role to get married to the love of one’s life.. The once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to run down staircases in wedding lehengas and into the arms of Salman Khan, whose blank stare reminds you of people rejected by all the auto drivers at Andheri station? What were you even smoking, Priyanka? Dump it now because it has given you a bad case of clarity.

&gt;It’s kind of rude to expect Salman Khan films to be about things like fair characterisation, actual roles for women and at least 10% logic. It’s like expecting Sadhvi Pragya to comment with a heart emoji on a Gandhi photo.

&gt;In Bharat, Sonali Kulkarni, who has more expressions in half a second than Khan has had in the last decade, plays Bharat’s mother. Kulkarni is 44, Khan is 53. This is the world you are supposed to live in, Priyanka.

&gt;	Just woman up and listen to Twitter bots with Salman Khan DPs for life advice.

He believed that it was his duty to uphold the sovereignty of his kingdom and uphold the legends of the valor and bravery of their clan. And so he kept on fighting until his last breath. 
He is an inspiration to all the Indians and a great example on fulfilling our duties towards our Motherland. We might not have to fight today to protect the sovereignty of our nation (Thanks to IndianArmed Forces). But in today's Modern World, it's the duty of every citizen of a nation to work hard and do something to make his Motherland a better place to live. That's the least anyone can do for their own nation.

So let us take Inspiration today  from Maharana Pratap , remember him and work hard endlessly to fulfill our duties towards our nation and make it a better place to live.

I had an event to attend and didn't 'groom' myself for over 3 months now. I chose 5 services and was ready to feel like a super smooth, hairless and agless queen at the end of it. This is not the first time I am doing any of these services. I consented to all these services and this is just a frustrating rant. Let's go:

It started off with waxing. The hair on the underarms, arms and legs were being ripped out using hot wax and strips. Do you know how painful it is when the waxing lady drops a spatula of hot wax on you accidentally? Small death. No one prepared me on how the shin hurts the most. The fucking shin!

Next, we moved to bleaching the face and neck. The purpose of bleaching is to make the tiny hair on your face and neck turn golden (???) and remove tan. She mixed some goop and applied a thick layer of it on my face/neck asked me to sit there half naked in a disposable makeshift nightie. You are supposed to keep it on for 15-20 minutes. It burns like a motherfucker. The burning sensation caused tears in my eyes (more, ahead). Chalo, next.

We moved to the facial. Again, she prepared a thali with 4 types of goopy shit on it. While it is a pleasant experience with complimentary face and shoulder massages, it also involved stabbing my nose with a sharp tool for blackheads. Like she pierced the top layer of my skin and removed them. Again, I have tears in my eyes because it HURTS so much. 

Then we move on to threading. Getting my upper lip threaded makes me want to just pick up a Gillette razor and start shaving. I have tears forming in the corner when she using that thread.

THIS, coupled with the salon lady's constant comments on how thin my hair are, how I should go for a better (more expensive) facial, how regular I should be with facials so I have lesser tan, how my nail beds are damaged and more shit. I had to postpone a hair spa because I had already spent 2.5 hours there!! Another service meant another half hour of more torture. 

I went there to feel good about myself and came out with pink and puffy eyes, thanks to my constant crying.

I discussed my ordeal with so many women and we realised that for so many women getting even low level jobs is dependent on us maintaining a basic level of beauty maintenance which can be extremely costly. 

Women are simultaneously expected to present a constant baseline of groomed attractiveness, and yet constantly judged and undermined for investing in said baseline through beauty spending. I concluded that the game is rigged so I might us well just enjoy my fake nails.

1559805076,jatadharius,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bxdqus/elephants_and_ancient_indian_warfare/,3,16,,,Elephants and ancient Indian warfare,"Found these interesting paragraphs in [The Wonder That was India by Basham](https://archive.org/details/TheWonderThatWasIndiaByALBasham/page/n7)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The traditional divisions of the Indian army were four: elephants,  cavalry, chariots and infantry; some sources add other categories,  such as navy, spies, pioneers and commissariat, to bring the total up  to six or eight. Of these elements the most important, from the point  of view of contemporary theory, was the first.    
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; Elephants employed in war are first definitely mentioned in the Buddhist scriptures, where it is said that king Bimbisara of Magadha  owned a large and efficient elephant corps. They were trained with  great care and attention, and, marching in the van of the army, acted  rather like tanks in modem warfare, breaking up the enemy's ranks and  smashing palisades, gates, and other defences (p. 459f); a line of  elephants might also act as a living bridge for crossing shallow rivers  and streams. Elephants were often protected by leather armour, and  their tusks tipped with metal spikes. The Chinese traveller Sung  Yiin, who visited the kingdom of the Hunas in the early Oth century,  speaks of fighting elephants with swords fastened to their trunks,  with which they wrought great carnage, but there is no confirmation  of this practice in other sources. As well as the mahout the elephant  usually carried two or three soldiers, armed with bows, javelins and  long spears, and advanced with a small detachment of infantry to defend it from attack.     
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The great reliance placed on elephants by Indian tacticians was,  from the practical point of view, unfortunate. Though fighting  elephants might at first strike great terror in an invading army unused to them, they were by no means invincible. Just as the Romans  found means of defeating the elephants of Pyrrhus and Hannibal, so  Greeks, Turks and other invaders soon lost their fear of the Indian  fighting elephant. Even the best trained elephant was demoralized  comparatively easily, especially by fire, and when overcome by panic it  would infect its fellows, until a whole squadron of elephants, trumpeting in terror, would turn from the battle, throw its riders, and trample  the troops of its own side. The pathetic Indian faith in the elephants'  fighting qualities was inherited by the Muslim conquerors, who, after  a few generations in India, became almost as reliant on elephants as  the Hindus, and suffered at the hands of armies without elephants in  just the same way.   Cavalry, though significant, was not lip to the standard of that of  many other early peoples, and the weakness of their cavalry was an  important factor in the defeat of Indian armies attacked by invaders  from the North-West; the decisive victory of Alexander over Porus in  326 b.c. and that of Muhammad of Ghor over Prthviraja in a.d. 1192  were both largely due to superior, more mobile cavalry. Mounted  archers were a special danger to Indian armies. 

Also, not mentioned in the book (as it relates to pre-Muslim India), major battles in later era also. This is covered in the [The Wonder That was India Part 2 by Rizvi](https://archive.org/details/TheWonderThatWasIndiaVol2SAARizvi/page/n1)

&gt;The two major  defeats of Mu'izzu'd-Dm show that Rajput military strength was  quite formidable; their fault lay in their adherence to fighting a  defensive war and their inability to take full advantage of a victory.  The ponderous war machinery of the Rajputs with their slow-  moving elephants was no match for the mobility and lightning  attacks of the Central Asian Turkic guerrilla warriors. Separated  from their homes by long distances and committed to obtaining  victory for their own enrichment, the Turkic troopers fought with  vigour and desperation. No such personal stake was involved for  the Rajputs. Political independence and nationalism in the  twentieth-century sense meant nothing to the twelfth-century  Hindus and Muslims. p. 25

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Elephants were effectively used from the days of Mahmud of  Ghazni, who developed an impressive stable which contained 1,000  elephants, tended by a Hindu staff. The elephants were lined up in  the front and centre of the armies. When out of control they played  havoc with the ranks, but their advantages were believed to  outweigh the disadvantages, and they were always present. p 175

&amp;#x200B;

And Babur's military genius at Panipat also made use of elephants weakness

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Ibrahim left Delhi to meet Babur with an army of 100,000  cavalry and 1,000 elephants. Babur's army comprised about 10,000  troopers. He took up a position near Panipat, keeping the town and   its suburbs on his right. Cannons mounted on wagons had been  placed in front of his army. Between sets of wagons, tied together  by strong rope, were gaps where small breastworks had been  erected to deploy one or two hundred horsemen. On the left, and in  other strategic areas, ditches had been dug. Babur's cavalry, or  'flying flanks', was expert in making lightning attacks on the  enemy's flanks and rear. Ibrahim's army depended on elephants  and consisted of mercenaries. The battle took place on 21 April 1526. Babur's flying flanks wheeled from right and left to attack the  enemy's rear, showering Ibrahim's troops with arrows. Ibrahim  sent reinforcements to the hard-pressed flanks. Groups from  Babur's right, left, and centre surrounded clusters of Indian troops,  while the cannons discharged balls on them from the left-hand side.  By the afternoon the Indian armies, which had no experience of  these tactics, had been routed. Between 16,000 and 40,000 Indians  were killed. Herd upon herd of elephants was captured. p 92-93",bxdqus,,false,/r/india/comments/bxdqus/elephants_and_ancient_indian_warfare/,Non-Political

As a lurker here, I have seen plenty of posts about Whey Proteins. I am sure most of the redditors like me, want to know best or cheap protein sources for a healthy lifestyle. Last 3-4 years, I have not been able to go to the gym or run regularly. Recently from last month, I have started the couch to 5K plan, which is going well. I am also planning to start the gym again. So I just started exploring which protein source can be a possible option once I start going regularly. So following is the [excel sheet](https://imgur.com/kJOnzvQ) I created after just one hour of study.

Again, this data is just a small project for my reference I am not a fitness expert or professional nutritionist. I thought I would share this here and hopefully, someone might find this useful.

So for creating this excel sheet, I considered most answered Whey Proteins(WPs) options on this sub. ON is the most preferred WP by most of the people, but of course, the common consensus is that cost is high. I have considered some Indian brands of WPs like MyFitFuel, AsItIs, MuscleBlaze. I had tried Combat WP by MusclePharm, so I have also added it here. The costs of WPs in the US are affordable, so if you are travelling or if you can request someone to get it for you it is also a cheaper option, and I have included that as well. And to make things interesting I have included the natural sources of protein i.e. eggs (used cost of dozen eggs to compare prices) and chicken breasts into the mix. I have also added paneer for vegetarians. I have tried to match the 30g protein requirement for egg and chicken so that the comparison can be even as most of the WPs are around that mark. So following are my observations:


**[Cost per gram of protein](https://imgur.com/scuv8wc)**

So the first data shows which are the cheapest sources of protein from selected data. And you can see that the natural sources (i.e. eggs and chicken)  are the cheapest by a long margin. Then come the Indian made proteins which are comparable to the price of ON or Combat WPs if you buy them in the US. Interesting to see that, MuscleBlaze and MyProtein are comparable to ON prices, and not cheaper which is the most common belief. Paneer is a decent option in terms of cost w.r.t WPs but is highest in calories.


**[Calories per gram of Protein](https://imgur.com/l8Mju1j)**

So if you refer to cost per gram of protein you might also see that eggs are the cheapest but also contain most calories per gram of protein. So if you want to lose weight and are on a low-calorie diet this might not be a good option. But if you see even though chicken breast having higher calories per gram of protein is not that far from WPs. All other WPs are very comparable in terms of calories per gram of protein. Paneer is the highest for calories per gram of protein.

I hope the above information might help if you are doing some kind of research. 


**TDLR**: Chicken is the best and cheap source of protein. If vegetarian, you can consider Indian made Whey Proteins like (MyFitFuel, AsItIs). MyProtein is costlier than its general view.

Before I go further, I do not want to name anyone or blame anyone as I feel we should all take a collective responsibility when something goes wrong around us.

On June, 5 2019 my close friend's parents were travelling from Hyderabad to Chennai in a private bus with almost every seat occupied. About 4 hours into the journey, my friend's dad (aged about 65) was slightly uncomfortable and started complaining about light chest pain, and in matter of no time it got worse and was crying for help. The driver and the staff stopped the bus and called 108 for ambulance. About 20 mins later, the staff decided to unload both of them at the side of road despite my friend's mom begging them to turn around the bus and take them to nearby hospital. Once they were dropped on the road, the bus left the place immediately. Meanwhile, my friend's dad was struggling with lot of pain and mom being helpless on the road. After an hour or so, the ambulance reached the place, checked the vitals and declared that he was dead 15 to 20 mins ago.

I don't know what went wrong, whom to blame and what happened to good old humanity. I understand these transport companies have a certain pressure to stick to the schedule so that they don't disappoint their customers. But what happened to those 20 people who were in the same bus? At least, if four of them would have convinced the driver(s) to try taking them to a hospital, they might have considered to detour. Even if they have failed to save him, they would have at least saved the humanity. Would they do the same if the same happens to their own?

&amp;#x200B;

I knew that our show was awesome cause of the fan mail we got week on week, but I didn't anticipate the love it got here on reddit. =D
 
Anyways, I had answered a few questions since I was part of the crew and I'd promised i'd upload a photo of the Big Picture. Well, earlier this week[ I chanced upon a panoramic photograph of the set while we were filming the Big Picture](https://imgur.com/a/ZteEiKa). 

You can see the 3 rooms where we shot the episodes, and the area in front where we shot the BiG Picture. 
We used a 3 cam setup with cam 1 and 2 being static and cam 3 mounted on a [Jimmy Jib](https://www.jimmyjib.com/) 

Rob is still around and very active and you can see more of what he's up to [here](https://www.youtube.com/user/MadStuffWithRob/)

1560853549,batradoesntwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c20kco/dont_give_your_12th_via_nios/,0,5,,,Don't give your 12th via NIOS,"This is mostly going to sound like a rant, but I do feel there's some truth in it. For those who are tempted by the idea of just giving your 12th w/o Jr. college's bs- please reconsider before signing up for NIOS.

There are plenty of benefits- the convenience, especially if you have some responsibilities like work, health issues, etc.

If you weren't interested in going to college for various reasons (like me)-  try to talk with your jr. college and see if they are willing to make compromises regarding attendance, etc. The only reason being that NIOS's mark-checking and the whole management sucks ass.

&amp;#x200B;

English was the only subject I needed a decent score in. I had scored 95 w/o studies during my SSC times, so I was mostly confident for my NIOS results. I even went all the way to solving the textbook's questionnaires, confirmed the correct writing format for grammar, etc. (I never bothered to touch the QAs nor read the chapters during my 10th), so there was the feeling of ""having done the grind"".  My point is that I never had 'bad' English skills.

Guess how much did I score? 61 out of 100.

Disregarding the fact that I couldn't believe my eyes, I did all the formalities and gave my paper for rechecking. I waited for the marks update, refreshing every hour. Still 61. Tried every means of contacting them, their inconveniently located offices in Delhi, no one picked up the phone. At my 100th try, some aunty picked up the phone and said, "" Jo site pe dikha raha hai, vahi hai.""

So I guess that's that? I scored terribly in the only thing I had some confidence in.

This was just for English, the topic I was sure I studied well for.  I have horrendous scores in other subjects as well, although I don't think I have the right to say anything- that I studied 100% for them. I did apply for other subject's rechecking but faced the same situation- zero change.

I still don't know how to interpret this whole thing. Maybe I really just suck in studies now, and have lost my talents/abilities? Maybe I really just deserved all of this?

&amp;#x200B;

For a while now, I've been wanting to try a long hair style. However my knowledge regarding hairstyles are nil. I have checked r/malegrooming and related subs. However, I thought of asking r/India cause of weather and cultural similarities.

My hair when kept short is quite thick or atleast it feels so. However ghe moment it crosses a threshold of length, it starts thinning and curling up like pubes.

It acts too stubborn and even combing the curls vigorously or using hair cream can't set the hair straight.

I've not been to any salons like toni and guy and till date done it from the local barber next door.

Would going to Toni n Guy help in any manner? If not, what would help?",c21ez2,,false,/r/india/comments/c21ez2/how_to_pull_off_a_long_hairstyle/,Non-Political

I believe that it will be quite useful in day to day activities of everyone. I have zero technical knowledge/education/experience. But I have a business sense because I'm already running a successful business not related to the tech field. I want to know how I can get this app developed. How I can approach investors. Are there any angel investors or forums where I can pitch my idea and they help me in materializing it without stealing my idea. Marketing is not a concern for me as I can get it done later on and initially I just want to run it as a trial and when it picks up momentum I can scale it higher. If I find that it's workable I can formulate an action plan for it.

An asshole to his father.   
   
He treated his girlfriend the same way he treated all the people in his life. Like an asshole. It's equality, if u actually look it without ur gender glasses.   
    
And due to his assholery he loses her. Goes on a downward spiral. Kinda redeems himself after his granny's death. Gets back the girl in cheesy bullshit climax. That's all.    
    
Just a character study of an asshole. No one's even talking about the glorification of cigarettes, alcohol and cocaine! Lol. The biggest killers in the world.

A quick Google search reveals that lottery is only legal in 13 states. So running these ads in the rest of the states should be illegal. 

Speaking strictly legally, buying a Snickers and waiting is no different from buying a lottery ticket and waiting to be picked imo.

Worse, a lot of such marketing is aimed at kids. They're not making the purchases but I know how much I pestered my parents to buy me stuff to get free toys as a kid. Affordable or not. 

It seems like one of those situations where law is targeting social evils. I'm not arguing against the law. My point is concerning corporate marketing.

Their son was leaving India for pursue MBA! 
After they left, my mother started comparing me to her. She always does that, but today I felt extreme anger and frustration and started to think about few things. I admit I am 21 and have some intellectual issues. I am slow and can't learn things. I never do simple tasks properly. I can't organise or take care of myself. Due to such things I isolate myself more and more to a point I don't sleep for 2 days and stay in my room talking to myself and crying! 
RANT
My grandpa was an imbecile and same goes for my grandma. My father died in 2003 in an accident! He barely got educated and we were lower middle class. My mother is getting same salary of 13 to 14k for past few years. She and my dad(RIP) didn't acheieve anything. So why they want to torture the hell out of me. I inherited their INTELLIGENCE, LOOKS and SKILLS. They need to understand some people are just born losers and don't have any skills or talent.  Dumbness and stupidity runs here in our family. They need to understand there is something called AUKAD. They were loser and I will be. It was pre genetic gamble. I was fucked when my dad and mom decided to breed! 
I am carrying their genetics so how the fuck they expect more. I am 21 and suicidal!

So anyway it's night now and it seemed like these people were hiding something within the bedsheet in the upper berth and now only one guy is sleeping there, the other guy is literally sleeping down on the floor in the middle of the compartment instead of sleeping at the upper berth with the other guy like during the day, I don't get why this sudden change of plan since 2 were there sleeping comfortably during the day. Also one of these guys were whispering something with the attender of the coach, I don't know what but pretty sure they were whispering. Am I overthinking this or is something really going on? I am feeling really anxious rn since I feel like I am the only outsider in this compartment. Also these people keep closing the curtains. Also I am a guy if it accounts for something.

Also regarding ticket collector, it seems like these boarded the train before I came and even when the TC came to check my ticket, he didn't do anything. So please tell me what's going on here? Should I really sleep tonight or should I be awake if something is going on?

If I don't edit my post by morning, assume I am dead or something happened. Yeah so looks like nothing happened afterall",c5sr29,,false,/r/india/comments/c5sr29/so_i_am_traveling_in_a_2nd_ac_train_coach_and/,Non-Political

They said the registration, stamp duty and other expenses will cost up to 1.5lakhs. So they want to make another agreement detailing decreased rental amount and deposit amount, so that those expenses will come down. They also said they will write another agreement detailing the original rental amount and deposit and that they will abide by that.

I'm not confident about this decreased amount deal. Which agreement will be valid? In the future they can say that the other agreement is not valid and pay me the reduced amount right?",c5sx8b,,false,/r/india/comments/c5sx8b/can_there_be_two_lease_agreement_on_rental_plot/,Non-Political

I want to tell those people that I understand your pain because even I have been through that phase. Even now I'm trying to hang on thinking all will go well in the end. 

About myself, I'm a fat guy (I think I look like shadow king from Legion) who has no friends and no idea what the fuck I'm doing with my life. Since my childhood I haven't had real friends, just people who took advantage of me. After my 10th I just pushed everyone away from my life including my parents because nobody understood how I felt and I didn't really have anyone to say about my feelings. During my engineering days, I wasn't really interested in engineering, rather I w hi juas much more into game design. Being in India your only choice is either engineering or MBBS. So I chose mechanical engineering after my 12th, but luck was never on my side. I had to stay another year because of backlogs while my class mates who weren't as studious like I was , ended up clearing their exams on their first attempt (all by making small chits and bribing their way to success while people like me had to struggle ). 
Even now still don't have friends and I always felt that I'm a burden to my family. Almost 40-50lakhs I have to really loan as I am going to sweden for higher studies. One time i tried to kill myself, I was so depressed that I though it would be better to end my life so that I don't cause problems to my family but it didn't go according to plan. I'll be going to Sweden in 2 months, so until then I'm playing video games that I missed during my childhood days.

All I'm trying to say is don't give up. I know it feels like the whole world is against you but you have your family. They are always with you no matter what.

We are limiting ourselves to publicly available short stories by Indian authors. Our first story was '[Delhi' by Vandana Singh](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bpnh70/reading_group_1_delhi_by_vandana_singh_sff/). This week, the story is: 
&gt; 
&gt; #['Qazzaqi' by Munshi Premchand](http://outofprintmagazine.co.in/archive/sept_2017_issue/munshi-premchand_qazzaqi.html) 
&gt; This story was first published in 1926 in a Hindi magazine called Madhuri, and if you have Premchand's Collected Works in Hindi, you will find this story in vol 5 of 
&gt; Mansarovar. This English translation is by Fatima Rizvi, and was published in Out of Print Magazine, and was a runner up for the Jawed Memorial translation prize.
&gt; A Hindi audio narration by Jameel Gulrayys is available on Youtube, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=902y-a1VIZg).

For those who aren't familiar, Dhanpat Rai Shrivastava, who wrote under the pen-name of [Munshi Premchand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premchand), was a prolific - and popular - writer of short stories in Hindi, in the early 1900s. 

This story is interesting for many reasons - 'Qazzaqi' means outlaw, although in the story, the qazzaqi in question is a mail-carrier. Premchand's acute understanding of poverty and class is very apparent from this story of the friendship between a the qazzaqi and a young child. 

The rules are simple - read the story and tell us what you thought about it in the comments. If you haven't read the story yet, I'd suggest you stay away from the comments as people's comments may contain spoilers! Please observe reddiquette - be polite and respectful.

Basically I passed last year from ISC(CLASS 12 EXAM) boards with a stupid 83%. I tried though. I tried. No one believes it and eventually I think I don't even. I could have pushed myself more from 16 to 18 hrs but hell I couldn't. Yeah quality&gt;quantity but am just a below average student who needed quantity with quality and still failed. 

Now the entrance exams and somehow I managed to **** that too. I gave only JEE MAINS and I wasn't fully aware of it so it didn't felt that bad and damn me, I decided to take a drop. 

Started from June, left everything from football to watching it and social media too. I sacrificed, okay. It's not I didn't. Joined coaching. The faculty was not that good, I am not blaming, I understand they have to cover 2 years syllabus in 1 year. So from December I started to do it myself and somehow fate decided to give me tinnitus, ah that damn sound. I regret listening study material with headphone. I couldn't study for 1 month. That one month I was depressed like hell and doctor prescribed me an anti depressants and atleast I could sleep peacefully after eating that. So I shit my chances this year too..

Wbjee went awful but I tried... I tried..... I did... Do anyone believe all this shit? someone has to.. it's driving me insane.. my parents don't.. my friends doesn't.. It all sounds like am making excuses I don't even blame them... It was all my fault... Dammit.. it's insane... 

I gave COMEDK, I got 17000k rank, is it good? I know this is shit too.. but do I have any chances of salvaging myself? Please... Do tell.. 

I want to pursue CSE and hell I am determined to do coding.. can i be successful as someone from TIER 1 ENGINEERING COLLEGE? I KNOW I MESSED UP..

[NP]","I work full time and recently due to role changes, I am accountable to a very senior professional in my office. Before I used to work from 10AM and would make it a point to leave by 6:30PM. My previous manager was also okay with that and I didn't see any reason to stay unless it was absolutely required.

Off late work has become so interesting that I see myself spending so much time on work that I don't get time to focus on learning. I used to maintain a spreadsheet with something I learned in the week, but I've nothing since a few months. Work has become challenging because of the challenging attitude of my peers, juniors and about how I am made a little more accountable than before. I'm not complaining. But I just can't seem to get myself to leave work.

Now I am in the office by 9 AM and I leave office at 12 or 1 AM. I get bored at home on the weekends and start doing the pending work. I can't dedicate this time to learning something new as I know it won't be continuous and I wont know when I'll catch up next. I'm behind schedule at work, but that's not a big problem. I don't really feel stressed or the need to change this at all. I'm not even feeling bad for the hours I clock, I'm actually satisfied.

Is it like this for everybody where after an age work consumes you so much that the only learning you do are things that you use in your work? Like recently we had to migrate old code into newer, efficient code and I learnt a lot of things. But I don't have that zeal of wanting to learn things just to learn this.

My HDFC bank reissues a fresh credit card , everything ready to use and activated . I use it first on a chip based pos machine for a very small amount on 26th may , 2 days later on 28th i use it for around 1k on an indian website which uses EBS as their gateway .

On may 31, around 12.52 am , there goes bunch of sms someone successfully adding my card in Uber netherlands/italy and also Spabooker in US .

I was fortunate that the risk control mechanism of HDFC bank kicked in and temporarily blocked the subsequent transactions. As a safety measure i also hotlisted them immediately . Upon calling HDFC bank credit card dept i learned that the crook tried to make 8 transactions each of 4k INR which ofcourse got declined . I have been lucky enough that he couldn’t take even a penny from me. The card had quite a high credit limit .

But since then i am pulling my hair out to understand how a new credit card got hacked when it was used only on chip based POS machine and a reputed payment processor called EBS .


Guys, please put in your theory here , I personally think it was the payment processor that dumped my card info . It will take a lot of guts for me now to trust all these payment processors ��

Then comes a speeding XUV, honking behind me. It was not a short honk asking someone to move away. It was a very long hong, the honk of entitlement. And then a brake, but the car was right behind me. I swiftly moved aside and turn around.

A couple in the car, 30-ish. And the man driving the car moves his hand angrily, like i interrupted his race.

**Company A)**

They contacted me through a consultancy, asked for basic details like present salary, expectations etc.  They arranged a telephonic interview. Now at the starting of interview he asked me ""where are you?"" i frankly said that i am in parking of my office. By that answer they assumed that i am not serious about job prospects and almost  next 20 mins of interview went on like timepass. While the talk was going on, suddenly the call got disconnected and they didn't even cared to call back.

&amp;#x200B;

**Company B)**

They contacted me through a consultancy, asked for basic details like present salary, expectations etc. Arranged a telephonic interview at 9 in the morning. Now considering the previous experience i thought that it would be better to take a half day leave, at least they see me as a potential candidate. At the time of interview no one called or contacted me. I called the consultancy guy and he said that he is not able to contact the HR told me to wait for half hour. Around 12 he confirmed to me that it won't be possible on that day. Boom! my half day leave wasted.

Again they arranged telephonic interview after 15 days, and i attended from my company's parking area. They were interested in having a face to face discussion with me. But they wanted me to travel 1200km by a bus to attend the interview. I politely said that this would waste my 3 days, but they were firm from their side that they will not reimburse flight charges.  

I thought that, if i go by flight i will not have to take two extra leaves and anyway the company is providing the money for bus it would take care of half of the flight ticket charges. So i booked flight tickets from my side (A big mistake). But, before booking the flights i contacted the HR and asked they if they are okay with my expected salary as i am spending money in attending the interview. HR said that they were okay with expected amount.

I attended two rounds of face to face interview and after that they told me that they were positive about my recruitment.But to my surprise the job role was completely different from JD sent to me earlier. 

* They were demoting me to a lower post(my present post is asst manager and the offered post was engineer), 
* they were reducing my responsibilities (i am a team lead at present and in JD they had mentioned the same, but during interview they told that it would be an individual contributor role and there is no team to manage)   
* they even changed the role, i was told that it is a development job but they told that ""every development job starts with testing, so you have to work in testing"", this might be true for freshers but not for experienced people.

Okay, i somehow managed to finish the interview and waited for the salary breakup from HR, after one week i received the mail. And they decided to offer me same as my present salary.  It was a straight away NO,NO from my side. 

Still waiting for travel reimbursement from their side.

&amp;#x200B;

**Company C)**

Company HR contacted directly.  He sent a JD for the post and i found it suited for me. He asked if i was interested, i said yes. He asked me where i live, i was living in the same city so he said that they will directly arrange the f2f interview. I was a bit confused about that, why would anyone call for f2f without telephonic interview?

On the day of interview HR called in morning to make sure i am coming, in the noon again he called me and asked to come an hour early. i reached there by 2pm and they made me wait till 4pm in reception(!)

When hr arrived he was having my 3 year old resume, i don't even know how he got it. It seemed to me that they had done no homework before calling me (just because i was in same city). He asked again for my salary details, expectations and all such details which he could have asked over mail or phone.

After again waiting for 1 hour he apologized and told that the panel which can take my interview is not present now, (so, why did he call me in first place) told me that he will come back to me in few days. It's been 15 days and still waiting.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:**

Company A) seemed not interested in interview.

Company B) Wasted 3-4 working days despite of knowing that my present salary is  same as their upper limit.

Company C) Wasted 1 day because HRs did not take time to read my resume before interview.",c37gpi,,false,/r/india/comments/c37gpi/recruiters_why_do_you_do_this/,Non-Political
1561108603,suplexcitybih,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c38dvj/why_driving_in_india_has_to_be_such_a_stressful/,4,13,,,Why driving in India has to be such a stressful experience? (Rant),"In my late teenage years, driving a car used to be such an exciting thing. I couldn't wait till I turned 18 and get my DL so I could start driving myself and it was amazing. I used to love driving then. 

5 years have passed and I absolutely hate driving. To the point that I avoid driving at all cost. Last couple of years commuting to college and work, most of the time all I did in my car was curse out my fellow drivers on road. Of course they didn't hear it but it helped me keep my stress low. Eventually I moved away from home to a new city and made sure I lived near my workplace so I didn't have to use a vehicle. Used public transport whenever I had to and kinda forgot what a nightmare it was to drive. 

Last couple of weeks, I traveled to USA for leisure and planned a 3 day long road trip ( the famous pacific coast highway). It took little time to get used driving on the opposite side and all but I got used it fairly quickly. I hit the road and it was amazing. I was loving driving again. Most people followed rules, even when there was a traffic jam, it never was a problem. No one honked, no one tried to overtake out of nowhere, everybody followed the signs. It was great. I loved every second of my road trip and felt the same excitement driving as I used to in my teenage years. 

And then I came home. I had to visit a nearby place. 20 minutes of drive and fuck, I was miserable again. 4 rows of cars in a 2 lane road, honking in every direction. I tried to keep my cool,  tried to drive the same way I was driving in the states, in my lane, using indicators, not trying to overtake etc. I'm waiting for people to cross the road and this guy behind me wouldn't stop honking until I moved ahead without bothering with what's ahead of me. Cool. As I proceed, seeing people driving between lanes, autos and two wheelers overtaking from any direction possible, changing lanes without indicators and I was pissed af. 
This one dude almost hit my rear driver side. I pulled over to have a word and the guy was looking down to his mobile phone. I honked to get his attention, he looks over, I ask him to put his phone down and he does, so I start driving again. As I pass him, I check in my rear view mirror and yep, he was on his phone again. 
Then there were these two gentlemen having a discussion in their car in the middle of the road, blocking both sides, didn't move until I started blowing my horn. 
I couldn't wait to get out of my car every second I was on the road. Why is the driving situation so shitty here? Sad thing is it isn't even talked about much. People are just okay with it. All traffic police does is to make sure people are wearing their seatbelts or not breaking the traffic signal because they can collect money if they don't. 
I don't see things changing in next 10 years. Not even sure if they'd change ever and that's sad.",c38dvj,,false,/r/india/comments/c38dvj/why_driving_in_india_has_to_be_such_a_stressful/,Non-Political

- The old one has a dog which shits and pees on our garden almost every single day. I've noticed her bringing her dog to our garden especially for this purpose. When I confronted her about it she laid a lecture on me about how I was harassing her and my garden was public property. When I asked her if it would be okay if I brought my own dog to shit in her yard, she again started shouting on about how old she is and I should obey my elders. After this, she agreed to take her dog to the park instead, but the next day the same thing happens.

- The manchild that lives with her is your typical Punjabi who is more than proud of his jatt heritage, shouting on about how he'll fuck everyone's mother under the influence of chitta and heavily subsidized booze courtesy of his dead father who was in the armed forces. This individual once crashed into a car and a bike under the influence of said subsidized booze but apparently got off easy since his chacha is an ASI in the Punjab Police. To celebrate, this twat partied with his friends, firing loud music up until 3AM and getting naked and urinating standing from his house's first floor balcony and again shouting how he'll engage in sexual acts with everyone's mothers just because he's a jatt.

What should I do about these folks? Filing a report is not an option considering he has a family member in the police.",c3az0h,,false,/r/india/comments/c3az0h/np_a_spiteful_old_woman/,Non-Political

I haven't seen it myself, but they gripe about how it portrays Kabir as a self-indulgent, mysogynistic jerk who just abuses everything in sight as he goes into a downward spiral.  And they literally give it 1 or 2 stars mostly just for that reason, noting how 'bad it is for society' that we continue to show such films.

I understand how it can be disturbing for people, or how uncomfortable it can be to watch, but at the same time, isn't it unfair to devalue it just for that?  Isn't the Indian audience mature enough to accept and see a film for its own merit, rather than how it impacts society? They don't like it because Kabir, the jerk, apparently gets off scot-free and his heroine lets herself be abused.  But the truth is, there a lot of people like that, unfortunately, in real life as well.  If the raw, toxic rage of an unrestrained and destructive male can't be shown on screen (despite how many times before it's been seen), how are you really going to look at it in real life as well? I remember the censor board did the same thing for Udta Punjab showing drug use.  I believe this moral self-policing, which apparently validates the censor board's existence (even though people apparently are at odds with it often), is more harmful than good. 

I mean, I get that people and critics can (and should) express what they see as negative portrayals in films, but there should also be a balance between that and between respecting the film as a creative statement objectively.  Because otherwise assessing the performances, screenplay, etc. is being lost just because YOU have a personal attitude against how the character is acting.",c3bw62,,false,/r/india/comments/c3bw62/vent_critics_are_hating_kabir_singh_for_its/,Non-Political

Friend into drug abuse and possibly feeling suicidal.,"A college friend of mine (let's call him X) has been working in Pune for a while now. A happy go lucky kind of guy. Loves smoking up, and always jolly.

He calls me off and on when he's high on weed and we talk about random shit.


Recently the way he's been talking has me concerned, the choice of words he's been using isn't really assuring at all. It has started worrying me. 


A mutual friend called me today and asked me about X. He asked if X sounded a bit off and then I told him what he's been talking about these days. This has the both of us very worried now. 


We had a senior who committed suicide and the things that he used talk about is kinda similar to what X talks about too.


So, later in the evening I called X just to talk about random things and I slowly eased into the current scene he's into. He's usually pretty open about the things he does. But today was different, he was just not opening up. It was very very difficult to talk to him.

He kept on talking about frequency, colors, music and a particular ""game"". He kept on telling that we're players and we need to beat this game. He was trying to relate everything to everything. He was just trying to link everything. 


I asked him if he did any hard drugs and then he told me that he did lines of cocaine earlier this month. He was busted and he spent a night in the jail too. He started telling me that it's still in his system and it ""just isn't going out"". I asked him if he did it recently again and he refused.


Even when the mutual friend called me, he told about what X spoke and the ""game"" thing was pretty common. My friend asked X to speak clearly and he was talking nonsense again. X even said ""If I go somewhere tomorrow, or if something happens to me, you'll be able to complete my story"".

Another disturbing thing that X told the mutual friend was he saw our senior (the one that committed suicide) in his dreams and he knows why he did it.


As of now X is on a 2 month notice period, and he told me that the people at his company know about his ""addiction"". Hearing this word, I asked him what he was addicted to and he started telling me that he can't tell it over the phone, he said he was afraid that someone would hear him. He said he'd want to meet us personally and talk about this substance addiction. 

I asked X about the other things he's been doing and he told me that everything has increased, from smoking cigs(every 30 mins) to his daily joints.


We talked a bit more and X knows that things are going downhill for him and he claims he's ready to receive help, he even mentioned rehab clinics. He was even paranoid about people at home plotting things against him. He said he was feeling lonely and he wanted a change of location and a fresh start. 


For now, I told X to call me whenever he feels like it, the mutual friend told him the same thing too. We know he's not himself and he's gone down a very dark path. We don't want it spiralling out of control. What can i do? What is the best possible way to approach this?",c3d5fv,,false,/r/india/comments/c3d5fv/need_help_friend_into_drug_abuse_and_possibly/,Non-Political

But, for e.g. my dad gave my religion as Hindu when the Census dude came, in many other cases the census taker records religion based on the name or community rather than actually asking each person their beliefs.

In 2006 World Values Survey - 6.6% Indians said they had no religion.

In the 2012 WIN-Gallup 13% were not religious, 3% were convinced atheists and 3% were unsure or did not respond.

Historically India has had the richest body of atheistic philosophy in the ancient world - Carvaka, Sāṃkhya, Buddhism and sophisticated god-free philosophies. Our national heros like Nehru and Bhagat Singh were atheists.

I was molested when I was a kid, I was around 7-8 years old. I hadn't talked anyone about this. 

We used to stay in a small town (~10,000 population), in a joint family. My father's brother was the one who molested me. This was around summer holidays and whole ordeal went for about a month

today morning I told my mom about this. turns out she actually knew this :( she started sobbing and I couldnt stop myself either

when I was a kid, I had told her about this too. I don't remember this part. She fought with my father and the family. however she never told them about it. She just fought and split the joint family. And later we moved away. I remember some big fight happening at my home and we going away. However, I had no idea it was cos of my mom and she was doing it for me. My grand father passed away, shortly thereafter this. He didn't like the family to split.

everyone in the extended family hates her, cos she broke a joint family and is the reason of death of my grandpa. Our relatives don't invite her, just invite my dad to functions. 

today she told me all this. she had go through a lot cos of me. I know i am damaged, but today after learning my mom was there for me all along comforted me 

she told me she didn't know what to do. she had never heard anything like that and she didn't know she could approach police or authorities. (both my father and mother are uneducated). so she did what the best she could do, run away from there and taking me

I don't have anyone to talk to in real life, so I wanted to get this off my chest. sorry for the long post",bvv5df,,false,/r/india/comments/bvv5df/today_i_told_my_maa_about_the_childhood_sexual/,Non-Political

1559485130,Nax87,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bvxtes/chernobyl_to_indian_context/,10,32,,,Chernobyl to Indian Context,"Hope some of you been watching the awesome Chernobyl on hotstar, documenting the events around nuclear power plant disaster by same name in erst USSR. The show is simply a work of genius, not only because of its cinematography but also because it brings out subtle ideas brilliantly. And you can relate to these ideas to your own socio political setting.

One idea that eerily fits into Indian context is 'hiding truth to protect so called national interest '. As the show depicts, investigation officer of chernobyl tragedy faces a dilemma to reveal or not to reveal to world the real cause of accident , that is faulty design of plant. Soviets have clear stand on it, their country simply can't have faulty nuclear plants because they are the best. Their nuclear plants are the best in world, hence can't be faulty. But in reality they were faulty and if they don't fix the design, similar disasters would happen at other installations too.

I find this context too similar to be ignored with our own state of affairs. We have a government which is hell bent on fudging numbers on economy, hiding reports and what not and we have a media that is totally deaf and blind to issues that actually matter and is more of a blowhorn of govt. I have seen likes of Arnab actually screaming at people in their shows for asking questions to govt narrative on events like surgical strike, or even at people for pointing out at lynchings etc, just cos ""IT MALIGNS INDIA'S IMAGE"". Do you remember how he went on and did a show scolding filmmakers of 'India's Daughter' for maligning india's image? Post balakote, we had an IAF helicopter accident the same day when pak intruded Indian space. This later turned out to be that IAF had mistakenly shot down its own heli. This should have been all over media but in actual there was pin drop silence - and we know why. 

So just wondering how this govt would have reacted to a nuclear tragedy like chernobyl? Obviously they would have tried best to hide information, be it fault or radiation diameter or death toll. And would we not be called anti national if we asked what happened. How the media would have white washed the entire accident as some small time event not to worry about and not to talk about because it hurts india's image. And would that have not paved way for more such disastrous accidents in future??",bvxtes,,false,/r/india/comments/bvxtes/chernobyl_to_indian_context/,Non-Political

I lied on bench. Wallet came out of pant. I got scared when I realised I lost it.

Thought of escaping from home because I was an  embarrassment. But decided to give my dad a chance.

My dad went the forest checkpost next to park. Asked to see CCTV footage. We saw footage for 3 hours like a mystery. Saw a man sat and stole my wallet.

My father got info that he was a forest worker under some street smart muslim contractor.

My father called contractor with a voice of Haryana ka Bahubali Jaat.

It worked. The muslim contractor agreed to give wallet.
Thankyou dad, you are not rich, but fuck... Even a rich person would have problem recovering his wallet but you did it so easily for me.

The modern-day Devdas, or the new revamped DDLJ, which forces you to use that tissue paper in the darkness of the theater.

But alas. All this movie ends up is insulting, objectifying women like no other movie has done in recent times.

Imagine a girl, a fresher just entering the college she has slogged off for, and the senior coming to the class and declaring that she is 'his girl', and no one should look at her. Picking her up from the class to teach her anatomy in the woods, and slapping her when she asks him to respect her dad.

The character, Kabir Singh is a sadist, horny sexist, who treats her girl like an object, a property who can be twisted and tweaked the way men want.

The concept of consent and romance has been killed to show how masculine the character is and being a chauvinist and a misogynist is glorified.

And the biggest problem was the hooting and shouting and whistling on some of the cringe-worthy scenes (the hero trying to rape pointing a knife to a girl, who is not even his girlfriend), in an otherwise decent crowd of movie-lovers in Pune.

I can't even imagine the effect this movie will have in states like UP and Bihar.

Cinema does have a responsibility and screwed up movies like these can play havoc with the minds of young male teens, who are about to encounter the beautiful concept of love.

It's not a love story, neither a cinema. Its a barbaric decimation of femininity.

Here's the whole background and some questions I have.

My mother and my maternal grandparents started blocking out my father from my life since I was about 2 years old. They didn't let him meet me or talk to me. My father was willing to get a divorce and joint custody at that point but my mother's side weren't ready. When I was 4-5 my mother deserted my father and left to study and work in Bangalore (we loved in Patna before). Finally, when I was 8-9, my mother changed her number and address and cut my father out of my life completely. He tried contacting my maternal grandparents, my school, mother's office, and other relatives to no avail. He gave up in 2013 but didn't lose hope.

During the time I was with my mother, she brainwashed me about my father's side saying he abusive and that he tried to kill us. I grew up believing this. 

My mother applied for divorce during 2015-2016 with the help of his father.

My mother had two long term affairs during this period. I can't say anything about the first one, but the second one happened during 2017 and I know it was sexual. She married the guy in 2017 in a temple, I don't think they went to court. I found condoms in her drawer and I saw her lingerie on the guys bed during this time.

She abused me in many ways too. Sometimes physical, many time emotional and mental. She neglected me. Didn't buy me basic stuff like underwear or provide food. I used to stay without food for 3-4 says during this time. 

In August 2018, she lost her job. She started talking to my father in September. I was still mad at the lies about my father and didn't speak to him too December. When we talked, I put two and two together and realised that my mother was lying the whole time. 

The divorce case hasn't been taken back by her yet, even though she wanted to fix things up. She still is in contact with the second guy and took a large sum of money from him in December (I have proof in the form of text messages sent by that guy himself). 

Now, for my questions:

Who has the upper hand in this case?

Will my father get the custody?

Can I testify in court if needed?

Will they consider my open of living with my father?

Is there a possibility of my father paying alimony?

I have some evidence collected in the form of pictures of the there of us (Second guy, me and Mom). Also have pics of the first guy with us. Have the text messages mentioned before and some documents. I'm not sure what they are, but they're probably bank records. I'll confirm with father and update.

He actually created whole conspiracy to isolate me from my friends. Even my bff, who has been through my all shit, somehow he manage to separate me from her. 

And I was too blinded in love to see any of this.

The pay is only 25 Rs/Hour, but the actual jobs do not require a lot of effort or time. Besides, the timings are proposed to be quite flexible, as you you're supposed to work only after your lectures. It's a great initiative and provides a lot of support to students in my college, as a lot of them are from lower income backgrounds. Each department can hire one or two, and the library hires 3 as they need people to mind the halls, distribute tags, etc.

One of my juniors who is in her final year started working in the library. This is where the chutiyapa starts. I did a stint as an assistant for my professor. We had to sign a check sheet denoting how many hours we worked each day, which the professor then submits to the accounts department and the money is handed to the professor, and finally to us. These kids were getting paid only 20 rupees, and they were working from 11 to 5 Monday-Saturday, so they have to miss out on a few lectures as well. If they were a minute late, the Librarian would sign only half the hours they completed for that day. One of the students is an orphan(Let's call him Jay), and depends on this money as his travel allowance - he has no provision or marketable skills to do a part time job outside this that would enable him to attend lectures. They've had to work even during their exams, and the scumbag would not let them open their books to study even if they were sitting idly, as he would deduct the hours himself. 

Recently I went to my college to collect my marksheet, and these kids were standing outside and one of them was crying. Apparently, Scumbag librarian deducted so many hours that Jay recieved only over 250 Rupees, which was enough to cover only a week's travel expenses. The other two got even less. I asked for their check sheets, and as it turns out, it was not the official form but one that the librarian *Handwrote*. I got them to go to the accounts department and ask for the records, and behold! Each of them were paid upwards of 1750 rupees every month! The highest any of them ever got was 700 rupees, for context.

So - yeah. He was pocketing the extra money every month. He was robbing these people of an education. It was not like he was lacking, as he was the head of the library department and got more than 1 lakh every month. He's also pretty educated - an Mphil in Library Science, or so the board outside his office proclaims. I know that education does not mean class, but still. For the extra 3k~ every month, this person would stoop so low.

This has been the case for years apparently. Nobody ever complained. Me, along with some other people urged Jay and others to reach out to the Principal/Dean and they did. 

Nothing happened.

The principal chided the Librarian, and asked him to give back the money he stole for that month. That man promptly yelled and fired them as soon as the principal left the room. Jay says that the principals breath was still in the air. When they complained to the principal that the money was not returned, he feigned ignorance and claimed that he couldn't meddle in the affairs of the library.

That Man is still stealing from the kids that are working over there. I have a feeling that he knows someone that enables his assholery. I'm just amazed at the utter malevolence and disregard.

They return the price difference.  The terms are such a way that you may not be get the price difference unless you buy them at both the places.

&amp;#x200B;

My experience was, I have purchased few items from Grofers, and on the same day I have found same items at D-Mart to be cheaper. The order value was 1,323 rupees, and if I would have bought the same items from D-Mart the value would have been 1,105 rupees. I was shocked to find the difference to be 218 rupees, I was in an assumption that there might be a difference and it would not be more than 2-4% but in reality it is 16%.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I took some snaps of the prices displayed in D-Mart and raised a concern with Grofers using the same. But Grofers doesn't accept them and they require a bill. How do you get a bill with out purchasing them and why would some one purchase same product twice?

&amp;#x200B;

I have been using Grofers long time, and I would have purchased 50k worth of merchandise from them in this period.

&amp;#x200B;

Be warned, Grofers doesn't have lowest prices, ~~better shop at different places~~, You may get cash back from ""lowest price guarantee""  after a little struggle,

 ~~only~~ advantage of Grofers is delivery to home, which many others do anyways.

The characters in the movie behave the way they do because that is their character trait. The filmmaker is not giving you a message, he/she has no bussiness  giving a message or educating the audience. They simply tell a story with the characters they created. 

&amp;#x200B;

Stop criticizing the behavior of the characters in a movie. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the film Kabir Singh/Arjun Reddy, it is highly possible that the protagonist is not a hero. He is an anti-hero. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some famous anti-heros: Michael Corleone (Godfather), Walter White (Breaking Bad), Travis Bickle (Taxi Driver). 

These characters would never have been possible if the writers/directors thought about morality, social responsibilty of the protagonists in a movie. If Walter White (the drug kingpin from Breaking Bad) was supposed to give a good message to the audience, Breaking Bad would've been the shittiest show in history.

I don't understand why Kabir Singh is being judged by Randians!. 
Firstly, to those prying about the story killing the concept of consent and romance, I guess you have been so brainwashed by Bollywood movies and soap opera where the male protagonist ALWAYS TAKES CONSENT before kissing her and DOESN'T SING a song ABOUT HER PHYSICAL BEAUTY, EMBARRASSING HER IN PUBLIC, that you judge a raw and wild portrayal of a character.
Is Kabir Singh HORNY and OBJECTIFIES WOMEN? He never stalked a women, never commented on a women, no booing, no cat calling even before meeting his first and last love Preeti. No whistling the lady and shouting her name. no getting into fights just to show his masculinity and impress her. Who are you to judge how two people in a relationship behave with each other.

Another radian was very upset that movie had a scene where the hero tries to cut a women's dress with knife. According to this person KABIR SINGH is SADIST&lt; RAPIST. I guess maybe the Redditor failed to realise that women(married) apparently wanted to sleep with the doctor who treated her husband. And NO the hero doesn't drag her into it. Maybe the Redditor doesn't get wild intercourse or foreplay. She brings UP and Bihar and I am really glad she brought up that. I wonder if she has watched Bhojpori movies. People like these are only worthy of the stereotype love stories where the hero is a scum who lives on the street, never been to college, shames the heroine by singing a song on her fairness, dances and forces her to dance or wait as soon as he sings she joins him to dance being impressed, and fights with the goons.

Bottom line I think it's RIDICULOUSLY STUPID AND DUMB to tag all those anti-rape feminist tags to a character who didn't judge her girlfriend being pregnant and still wanted to marry her. Who became a maniac on realising she got married. Who was so crazy for her to give-up home, defy his father rather than moving on. Those who think the hero slapping his girlfriend as a decimation of feminism, fail to recognise his unconditional love and probably has never been in a relationship where the guy and girl are crazy about each other.",c4r90x,,false,/r/india/comments/c4r90x/kabir_singh_sadist_horny_sexist_objectifying_women/,Non-Political

Okay here's something new (to non-Telugus) I wanted to say about Arjun Reddy / Kabir Singh. Here's some context how the film was hyped up and how it gathered such a following. Personally, I found the film good but I can understand why certain reviewers are a bit worried of the kind of impact it can have.

AR had a big influence on Telugu cinema. The poster had the lead pair touching lips and it made some hungama on TV media. It led way to more films with minor cuss words, a kiss scene or two, a macho hero with a angry attitude and a bike. I didnt care for them but I wanted more films which did screenplay, storytelling and music like Arjun Reddy. The film had no dance sequences, no boob shot or waist shot of the heroine and no shitty comedy track so it was already better than the regular masala Telugu movie to me.

In the pre-release event of AR, Vijay Deverakonda who couldn't get out of the Arjun Reddy persona, said that the ""censor"" board censored the Hindi cuss word ""madarchod"", and encouraged the audience there to shout out ""madarchod"" out loud in the theatres as a reply to the CBFC. [LINK](https://youtu.be/qBgg-oZKTik?t=578)

Also one more excerpt from the same event, he speaks in English about how ""he doesnt want to apologise to no fucking person"". [LINK2](https://youtu.be/qBgg-oZKTik?t=378)

I have seen videos circulating at the time of release of people actually following what he said and shout ""madarchod"" in theatres.

After many people in the TV media called out his rowdy behaviour, he accepted that and launched his own brand of clothing called ROWDY WEAR. Extremely overpriced so I laughed and kind of forgot about it till I went to my village during the holidays.

I have seen many youth wearing ROWDY WEAR. Some guys were rash driving wearing it. It could have been that these guys were the same even before AR but I could see that quite a lot of these guys loved and idolized the ""badass"" attitude of AR.

I liked the film but to say it has no real effect on the people is a wrong statement. Both sides of the argument are kinda correct.",c4syov,,false,/r/india/comments/c4syov/vijay_deverakonda_and_his_rowdy_brand_something_i/,Non-Political

I’m writing this to express my frustration and concern for the aspirational dream of a Digital India. I’m a fairly educated Indian with a good hold of technology. I use Internet more than an average Indian. I’m sharing all this because it is important to let you all know that if this can happen to a person like me, how tough it would be for a non-technical person. I will share three different incidents and how together, they all have made my life tougher. 

Incident 1: I have a 4-year old Airtel postpaid account. This number was allotted to me probably after staying inactive for days/months.

Incident 2: I receive multiple bank alerts on my number, probably of the person who used this number before. I reach out to Airtel (sometime in 2017) to get the alerts stopped. Airtel asks me to get in touch with the bank. I reach out to the bank (SBI, yes - State Bank of India). Since I’m not a customer, their is no defined mechanism to get in touch with them. I somehow reach out to them through social media then their website and then e-mail. After multiple threads trying to explain my situation, I’m asked to go to the home branch (just calling it out again - I’m not their customer) and get the number removed from there. After multiple tries, I give up and accept my fate of getting the alerts. 

Incident 3: Sometime in 2018, Paytm launches their own UPI platform and I sign up for it. While signing up for it, I am asked for selecting a bank and unknowingly I click State Bank of India (probably the only mistake). The app hangs and I close the app. Period. Fast forward to June 2019, my friend sends me money through Paytm (UPI platform) and I get a notification that I’ve received the money. I open the app, check my Paytm wallet and there’s no money. Although, I see that my Paytm UPI platform has a bank account linked and the money has gone there. It is an SBI account which I’ve no idea and I can only see the last four digits of the account number. I try to check balance/withdraw ‘my money’ but I can not. I can’t use the money because I don’t have the debit card details (obviously because it is not my account!) and hence I haven’t setup the PIN. Multiple calls to Paytm, I force the representative to escalate the call and finally I’m told that I had linked this SBI account and I need to get in touch with both the banks (SBI and another one from which the money was sent) to get the transaction reversed. In a nutshell, money gone for a toss.

I am obviously going to now remove the account from Paytm UPI but I want a permanent fix to this problem. If anyone who happens to know how to get rid of this, please help me out. I will be very grateful and in fact if you’re in NCR, I will treat you as well.

TL;DR: Airtel allotted me a used number which is still being used by someone for their SBI bank account and money sent to my Paytm UPI is going in this account and I don’t know how to get rid of this.

Thanks for reading my poorly drafted story, looking forward to your replies.",bxvrjk,,false,/r/india/comments/bxvrjk/how_allotment_of_a_used_number_while_taking_a_new/,Non-Political

Living in India, you'll be given options to pursue a degree in Architecture, Engineering, Medical and other IT/CS or management courses after completion of your Jr. College.
People are so unaware of other amazing courses you can take up.

I've just completed a 3 year course of B.Sc. in Information Technology and during this course I've developed an interest in Design (Graphics, Information, Communication, etc).

Now while I'm looking for a Master's degree in Product/Information Design, I see so many Bachelor's degrees in Design that I could've taken up after Jr. College.

I don't regret these three years but I feel foolish for being unaware about such important things in life. I wish I could've known earlier.

Also very disappointed at how people in India emphasize Engineering, Architecture or other technical courses.

I've got no hate for any of the courses offered..I just wished the people of this country especially the youth would be aware of the various courses that can be taken up.

Out of nowhere this uncle decides to go on the other side of the road from a gully. 

We crash, but because speed was really less and I hit the brake at the right time our bikes just touched. No one was hurt, no bikes were damaged. I asked him to drive carefully and he lashes out at me. 

I am 25 years old and suddenly I am surrounded by all uncles pointing there ugly hands inches away from my face saying I need to say sorry to the uncle I hit because he is the age of my mothers brothers. 

I decline and ask them to stop pointing there fingers at me and if they want to call the police then go ahead I will wait because I know I am right. 

Other uncles interfere and say it’s no big deal just say sorry and go even the police won’t listen to me.

&gt;!Thank you again, by the way for that, kind redditors!!&lt;

Anyway, here I am. Since the last post got so much attention, it got me thinking. Would any of you like to talk with me for 15-30 minutes on a podcast about anything sex ed-related? It could be about your opinions, your experiences; I'd ask you questions. It'd be fun!

If any of you fine people are up for that, I'd love to have you.

That's all for now, folks!

I have seen a bunch of people go to water parks and shit  with their kids but it is basically a waste of money.

Now here I am inspired by Mamta Begum.

This makes it the perfect time to act.The best way to shed it off is to go on strike or just protest on the streets 

It is a 100% win-win situation. 

How you may ask. Well listen.

Not only do you get to meet your demands but the more important thing is that when you do so you will most likely get water cannoned this will basically be a free bath cum waterpark experience. 

You ever drop cold water over your head? It feels amazing and kills off a lot of heat. Now imagine this bliss over you.As a bonus as stated above, you also get to meet your demands from the government.

This article is pretty accurate. When I came to know about how my male classmates talked about their female counterparts (including me), I felt pretty horrible. Comments ranging from graphic disgusting descriptions of what they would do to your body parts, to needlessly harsh criticisms about how you look, what to wear. It's normalized to the point that you can't even criticize it, otherwise, people laugh at you and consider you a spoilsport. And retort with ""Let boys be boys"". Guys, please call out your guy friends when they're being misogynistic.

I could see that the driver in the slow car was angry at me and was saying something, I tried to apologise by showing lifting my hand, don't know if he could see it since it was raining, I was trying to reverse to allow the other cars to pass but then the car behind started honking as well, I felt horrible. But then thank god the the cars started moving on the lane I was supposed to be and the car behind me allowed me to rejoin.  Must have been on the wrong lane for 1 to 2 minutes

I have a feeling that services provided to us are sham and not worth the money, whenever I click on the book icon, it will raise the fare atleast by 1000 making me turn to railways.

What is the convenience fee and why can't they directly include it in first price shown to us? Do they really think that customer won't notice the price difference first shown and while paying?

How is airline always increases their dynamic prices only when I click on the book option?

Edit1: even the airline websites include processing fee in the end (I checked for Air Asia, 380/-)

Irctc air has a complication, they are showing 0 kg check in baggage for air Asia but 15kgs for others. Is it truly flight dependent or they have separate tie ups with airlines..?? Can anybody clarify on it..??

Edit 2: thank you guys for the input. I have booked the flights through IRCTC air (250/- extra charges, which were mentioned clearly and includes travel insurances)

I cooked it on a frying pan and it did melt oddly and turned black, but I decided to give it another try and I boiled the rice and made it into a ball in my hands and it did bounce just like a rubber ball would.

The US Patent Office granted a broad patent in 1997 but it was eventually watered down after India challenged the patent and threatened a WTO dispute.","Company Rice Tec : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RiceTec

**Source** : https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1143209

&gt; THE FACTS
&gt; 
&gt; * Originally from India and Pakistan, Basmati became a controversial ‘issue’ after RiceTec, a Texas-based company, in 1997, patented some types of rice they developed as “American basmati”.
&gt; * RiceTec Inc, had been trying to enter the international Basmati market with brands like “Kasmati” and “Texmati”. Ultimately, the company claimed to have developed a new strain of aromatic rice by interbreeding basmati with another variety. They sought to call the allegedly- new variety as Texmati or American Basmati.
&gt; * RiceTec Inc, was issued the Patent number 5663484 on Basmati rice lines and grains on September 2, 1997.
&gt; * This was objected to by two Indian nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) — Centre for Food Safety, an international NGO that campaigns against biopiracy, and the Research Foundation for Science, Technology and Ecology, an Indian environmental NGO who filed legal petitions in the United States. The Centre for Scientific and Industrial Research also
&gt; objected to it.
&gt; * They sought trade protection for basmati rice of the Indian subcontinent and jasmine rice of
&gt; Thailand. They demanded amendment of U.S. rice standards to specify that the term “basmati” can be used only for rice grown in India and Pakistan, and jasmine for the Thai rice.
&gt; * The Indian government, after putting together the evidence, officially challenged the patent in June 2000.

1561027815,_pkumar_,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c2ujhc/rant_about_allahabad_banks_bad_customer_service/,6,8,,,[RANT] about Allahabad Bank's bad customer service,"TLDR : Rant about Allahabad Bank's bad customer service, at various levels.

Here is a story of a bad service experience I had with Allahabad Bank, divided into different levels of service failure...

Part 1 ---  'Baad Main Aao' officer

My Parents had a old locker in the Allahabad Bank ( branch - Navyug Market, Ghaziabad ). After my parents passed away, I approached the bank branch, and was redirected to a certain bank officer. I went and tried talking to him, but he rudely said 'kal aao, aaj nahi hoga' (come tomorrow, wont happen today). Assuming he is busy, I left the bank.  I went back to the bank again, next morning, and tried talking to him again. I told him that I just need to know the procedure to such a case. I was told ' Dedh baje ke baad aana' ( come after 1:30 PM ). I decided to wait in the bank itself, and sat in a waiting seat. To my shock and dismay, this officer did nothing except telling people to come later/next day, and just passing time on phone, while eating multiple packets of gutka. At 1:30, I went to him, and explained my situation, so he said that because there is no nominee name, I should get a certificate proving that I am a legal heir. What is saddening is that, he took 1.5 days to tell me this one sentence, and that too when he was certainly not busy.

Part 2 ---  'Rule is Rule' lady

After few months, I got the 'Varisan Praman Patra' (Legal Heir Certificate) issued by the city magistrate office. I took this certificate and approached the bank again. Fortunately I didn't see the 'baad main aao' officer in the branch. This time I was directed to a lady sitting there. The lady was genuinely busy, so I waited in the queue, and once it was my turn, I explained my situation to her. She listened to me, understood the case, and told me that she will check with zonal office. After some days, I went back and and asked her for update, but she said that there is no update. I kept going to followup several times in the coming months. At one point, I was running out of patience, so one day I approached the bank manager, which was of not much help either. after several followups, the lady told me that this is not sufficient, and I have to get a legal heir document from the court instead. I tried explaining that the legal heir certificate was issued by a government body and should be acceptable, but I was told that the bank's rule says to get the document it from the court, rule is rule.
I fail to understand that, although other PSU organizations ( SBI, LIC, postoffice, etc... ) accepted this succession certificate without any issues, why Allahabad bank refuses to do so.

Part 3 ---  Escalation and Customer Grievance Redressal Cell is of no use

I thought that maybe the decision is actually above the lady's control, so I wrote a mail to the higher ups. I copied the CGRC ( customer grievance redressal cell ), zonal office of Delhi NCR, customer care, etc. I was hoping that I will explain the validity of the (Legal Heir Certificate) issued by the city magistrate office, and was hoping that like the other PSUs ( SBI, LIC, postoffice, etc... ), somebody higher up will accept my document.
After many followup mails, and many bounced mails (Error delivering to HO CGRC/ALLAHABADBANK; Router: Database disk quota exceeded)(Error delivering to customercare/ALLAHABADBANK; Router: Database disk quota exceeded), I finally got through to the CGRC and Zonal office.
Now, I would like to stress on the fact that, the reason a CGRC is usually established in a company, is that they can handle escalations at a higher level, and take positive action in customer's benefit. 
Guess what was the action taken by the CGRC ! They forwarded the same mail to my branch's email id, asking the branch to address the issue ! 
And ofcourse, the branch again replied the same, to get court document. 


I am tired of this red-tape, and am very disappointed about my experience with Allahabad bank. Maybe, I will end up approaching the court for the said document.


I have been a participant of this great community for many years (even before RDDs were a thing)(this is an alt), so my advise to all of you wonderful people is that, if you or your parents have an account in Allahabad bank, please consider moving to a better bank (I strongly suggest a private bank).

But honestly I've grown tired of being the butt of people's taunts and jibes. Plus, as an adult in the workforce, not knowing how to ride a vehicle is just a bad look all-around. I thought of starting the learning process with a motorbike but my sole attempt to operate one ended up with me nearly crashing the goddamn thing. So a scooty it is.

Good thing is that I know to ride a bicycle so the general skills should carry-over. My dad's old Activa is still functional and is lying around begging to be rode. Since I feel kinda silly about asking people for help I'm probably going to go about learning my way around the machine all alone.

I'm hoping there's someone who can offer sage advice. I'm a commerce graduate from a premier Indian college. On completing my bachelor's degree I started working for a legislator in their communications team. The job was intellectually stimulating and paid well.I was surrounded by smart people. There I met a girl who was smart, mature, cosmopolitan, articulate.

 Without delving into details I'll mention we started dating. I couldn't have asked for more from life. Everything was great. The 3 years we were together were great for me. However it turns out that she had been cheating on me with a close, close friend of mine for a while now. When I confront her she tells me I just wasn't good enough and she smirked. I thought she was the girl I'd spend my life with.


I lost 2 very important people. I was dismissed from my job.
To make matters worse, I learn that my parents who've been married for 25 years are experiencing trouble in their marriage. I'm broken. I'm here sitting at some desolate spot crying my heart out. There's no one. Absolutely no one with me. I want to cry. But I'm unable to.

I've no one to talk to. My parents too are devastated. My ' friends' chose the girl over me. I've lost all motivation. I'm not going to commit suicide.

&amp;#x200B;

A friend of mine (27f) has recently moved to Pune for an internship. She has been severely depressed for a long time now, I think it might be this [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysthymia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysthymia). She also suffers from social anxiety and hardly has any friends whom she can confide in. Past attempts at talking to people have led to guys trying to flirt with her etc and she has mostly come away disappointed. She also tends to be picky about people because she feels they don't understand her.

&amp;#x200B;

Lately she has been more depressed and anxious than I've seen her. The move and the new environment might have something to do with it and also that fact that she has to get her degree and the internship isn't going well. She often feels like she is incompetent (she isn't) and undergoes episodes of very low self esteem. She frequently talks about how she wants to end it all and how every single day is a struggle. She hasn't managed to make any friends in Pune (couple of guys already tried to flirt with her which made her stop trying). Basically she has no support system around her. She refuses to talk to her parents/brother because she feels they won't understand and will pressure her to come back home and get married (they are from Haryana).

She talks to me about all this and for me this is emotionally very difficult. It takes a lot of time and phone calls, time that I don't have. I think she feels way more connected to me than I do and that makes it even more difficult. I cannot even have this conversation with her without making her cry. Also I feel that talking to me doesn't do anything in solving her problems, it is just a little comfort and distraction. She refuses to see a doctor, she says it is difficult to take that initiative and go talk to a random stranger. I can understand this but I don't know what else to do.

It will be a great help if someone can suggest what I can do in this situation or more importantly what she can do? I'm sure other people face similar stuff. Also any suggestions specific to Pune are most welcome.  I am really out of ideas.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Depressed friend in Pune, need help.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: A couple of clarifications related to the replies here:

1. I know that therapy and a psychologist is the way to go but it is hard to convince her and since I'm not in the same city I can't even take her along. Also if someone knows a particular doctor and can recommend that will be a great help.
2. The issues I'm talking about above are not self-diagnosis. She has been to a psychologist once about a year ago, things might have changed since then though. The reason I used ""I think it might be"" is because she called it Persistent depression disorder and this is what came up when I googled it.

Thanks for all the support and love guys! I'm sorry I can't respond to everyone. I hope some of the advice here will work out.",c0fuv4,,false,/r/india/comments/c0fuv4/friend_is_depressed_and_possibly_suicidal_need/,Non-Political

I can't face it, it feels like I'll never get the respect and general sense of worth that most people do get. I've been used along the way and despite of me working real hard, I'm the kind of personality that people feel comfortable walking all over.



The most recent one was a group that I was a part of, I attended their weekly events, spread awareness about it in other areas and even did a show with them. They've formed a smaller team out of the group and didn't even bother to tell me they're kicking me out.



I was a huge believer in the fact that working hard for something and giving it your all consistently makes you have good results, I would ask about certain things and whether they're okay or not, suggest stuff etc. and in the end if something like this happens just because I didn't get along with the people enough (even THAT I did, but it felt like they ignored me for no reason) you start losing hope



It happened in job, it happened during coaching and it happened in other things I've tried. I am silently ostracized and I am sick of being treated this way.",c0gw7i,,false,/r/india/comments/c0gw7i/having_depressivesuicidal_thoughts_dont_want_to/,Non-Political

I Came here from what Kunal Kamra shared recently. After watching the video, please remember to reply in the comments if you do get it, it would please Shri Shri.  
If you dont, well Asaram will haunt your dreams, and you get 11 years of badluck. I dont know which is worse.  
Also on the panel in the video, there is Javed Akhtar, who is a renowned writer, social thinker and an athiest who vehemently opposes the existence of godmen and all that they stand for, so this was an interesting watch.  
All in all I would give this video 5/7.  
Incase anyone's wondering why a 57 second video has a full para IMDB review posted with it, its because some incel of a mod hates me and keep deleting my post with frivolous reasons like ""post doesent have orignal title or relevent description"" to ""detailed statement of reasonable length and carry relevant information"".  
Well here's your precious relevant paragraph princess, cant wait to see what flair you're gonna use to remove this one.

 Mallappa, a farmer in a village in India's southern state of Andhra Pradesh, told his family in August last year that he was going to a nearby city to buy some farm equipment.  But he never returned.   His body was found in the same farm where he spent most of his life a day later. Before taking his life, he bought everything that his family would need for his funeral.  This 360 film in based on a letter written by his daughter Laxmi Devi to her father.",c0i47g,,false,/r/india/comments/c0i47g/a_letter_to_my_father_who_took_his_own_life_bbc/,Non-Political

So in case you have medical emergencies that go over and above your Sum Assured, you can talk to your HR and ask them to release money from this buffer to your insurance. Typically, companies can go up to 100% of your SA. That is, if you have a 5 lakh policy, the company can increase it by up to 5 lakhs more. 

However know that they are not obligated to do it. And they most often only release it for serious cases where the employee is going to be shelling out lakhs from their pocket. So be nice to them about it and don't demand it.",c0irmc,,false,/r/india/comments/c0irmc/ysk_you_can_ask_your_company_to_increase_your/,Non-Political
1560510332,heisenberg005,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c0isvf/most_of_us_middle_class_guys_without_any/,618,759,,,Most of us middle class guys( without any generational wealth ) earning 30k-50k per month will never be financially independent in life.,"This post is not for NRI randians who can easily convert their dollar bills to INR and can easily retire.   


This post is for middle class guys in their 20s earning 30k -50k per month without any generational wealth. 

The thing is that few people in india have some kind of leverage such as inheritance,land,multiple properties , assets etc. So middle class guys earning 30k-50k per month has to support themselves and  their family living in a different state .

&amp;#x200B;

Every retirement calculator is showing that you need a corpus of 9-10 crore to retire if you in your 20s .

Unlike USA and other European countries ,Indian government doesnt provides social security for elderly people. Nearly 71% of senior citizens in India are dependent on their children for financial needs. Link given below.

[https://www.livemint.com/news/india/social-security-for-elderly-inadequate-in-india-un-report-1554292326814.html](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/social-security-for-elderly-inadequate-in-india-un-report-1554292326814.html)

So if you dont have 9-10 crore in assets in your 50s , you are basically fucked (assuming you are now in your early 20s). and 90% of indians will never be able to achieve this.

&amp;#x200B;

I recently attended a stock market seminar in banglore and it was shit .I wasted 12000  inr. Most of the guys in the seminar were in their late 30s and 40s looking to find a 2nd income through stock market. Only few came to recover their losses .And the guy who was conducting the seminar told these people that they can easily earn 200% to 300% annually through stock market and most of them believed it. We all know that successful trader like PR Sundar are generating only 50% profit annually and this guy was saying that they can earn 300% annually. People have very unrealistic goals when it comes to stock market.

&amp;#x200B;

Most people dont give a shit about their finances in their 20s and many of them make very poor decisions which turns deadly in their late 40s and 50s.Some of them will be forced to work till they die.

There are three major costs that are increasing faster than both wages  and inflation - healthcare, education, and real estate.  So financial independence becomes neccessary to achieve or your next generation might suffer.  Let me put it this way: without family money, your child may start off in a financial hole they can't climb out of. 

&amp;#x200B;

My point is that  being born with a silver spoon is way more beneficial than not being born with one. It makes life more simpler.

Some of you will say get an MS and move abroad or invest in real estate. But I'd love a suggestion which doesn't involve inheritance and working abroad.",c0isvf,,false,/r/india/comments/c0isvf/most_of_us_middle_class_guys_without_any/,Non-Political

So to start with, I gave JEE Advanced 2019. I had been a fairly good student throughout my school life, and performed quite well in the +2 level competitive exam scenario as well. I've always been one of the good students in my institution. Today the JEE Advanced results were declared, and I got a rank of around 8400+. Well, to be honest, this rank won't do me any good and won't let me get admitted into a good IIT in a good stream. I was very, very disappointed. I am usually a quite reserved guy, even if I failed in something I would not express my disappointment that much in front of my parents and relatives, I would rather just shrug it off, smile a bit and say I'll try harder next time. But today, I was really disappointed because I really wanted to get into an IIT, but evidently could not. And I made it evident to my mother that my mood was off, I expected better results but I failed. The least i could expect was silence, but no! Why would she remain silent? Immediately she started comparing me to the extremely intelligent boy (who is also a great friend of mine) who got 1300+ -ish rank, started singing plaudits about him, how brilliant he is, what is his brain made up of and stuff. She started saying that my coming first in the school exams were of no use, that I was not as brilliant as that guy, this and that, blah blah. I did try very hard (though I eased off during phases of my preparation, I admit that) and I'm really disappointed myself after this result, but come on! Was that even a time to say those things, how was that supposed to cheer me up and give me hope which I really expected? I'm already down and my mother just does not care; she'd rather add to my misery. And when I said something against what she was saying, oh my! She started saying more things, which   brought my morale down a few more notches.

&amp;#x200B;

Today, I'm really frustrated that I failed . But at least she could have made me feel better? No. You might take this as the ramblings of an 18 year old, but yeah, I needed to get this out really bad.",c0m1el,,false,/r/india/comments/c0m1el/what_the_heck_is_wrong_with_my_parent/,Non-Political

However, he has been controversial too, with some students filing case against him recently.

I had read Anand Kumar's wikipedia page and an excerpt from his biography by Biju Mathew.

It mentions that Anand Kumar had published ground breaking work during M.Sc in some journal and was chosen for PhD at Cambridge University.

https://www.quora.com/Where-can-I-find-the-research-papers-submitted-Anand-Kumar-founder-of-super-30

The biography even goes on to mention that Anand Kumar's work created quite a stir in Mathematics community and he was destined to become a ground breaking mathematician. Reading it, I was curious to know what he published.



It mentions that Anand Kumar ""published a paper"" in a journal called Spectrum called ""Happy Numbers"". I checked the journal, 

http://www.appliedprobability.org/content.aspx?Group=ms&amp;Page=MS254

I found it is nothing but a comment to the editor, not even a paper.

A layman should understand a research paper is a completely different ball game than writing a letter to editor. A researcher needs to fight with other researchers to get his/her paper published.

Does this not raise questions on his credibility. However, we should note I do not know of any source where Anand Kumar has personally mentioned about any achievement.

I can't say about Kolkata or Chennai or Hyderabad because I've never lived there.

It amazes me that so many people are okay living in such awful living conditions. There is no concept of work-life balance, traffic is atrocious, there are few public spaces, and even things like clean water and air are hard to get.

Even large corporations are now asking their employees to do ""startup hours"" and work 10-12 hours a day. The commute takes 2 hours for most of my friends. They have no concept of a personal life and no energy to pursue any hobbies or interests. Its just go to work, come home, sleep, and then unwind on the weekend. 

Traffic and the lack of roads has gone from bad to worse. Delhi is still saved because of metro, but its shameful that cities as large as Bangalore and Mumbai have so little metro presence in nearly 2020.

Add to that the lack of public spaces where people can just meet together. Yes, there are lots of parks in these cities, but most of the time, they're so far from places of work that they're seldom used by regular office going people. Delhi's parks are in South &amp; Central Delhi, while most people work in Gurgaon. As a result, ""public spaces"" are now basically awful corporate shopping centres (like Cyberhub). In Mumbai, you have Marine Drive, but that's not where most people work.

Throw in crappy air quality (Delhi is the worst culprit), shitty water quality (Bangalore water has made all my friends bald before their time), and often, no water at all.

And top it all, rent is uncontrollably high in most of these places. Houses that wouldn't pass muster even in third world shitholes are passed off ""luxurious"" in these cities. Landlords make up their own rules (like asking for a year's rent as deposit - wtf?). And forget buying a place of your own near your workplace - anything affordable is fucking 40km from the office.

Why the hell are people living in these places not demanding more? They're the economic centres of the country, contributing literally hundreds of billions of $ to the GDP.

I am not a doctor. To be more accurate, I chose not to be one. My parents are doctors, my husband is a doctor and a lot of my friends and family are also doctors. But I am not. Why? Because all my life, I saw how hard my parents worked. How they missed special occasions and movies because of an emergency call. How my mom could never quite get properly ready for any event, lest she get a call from the hospital, though blood stains still got to some clothes. How my parents got used to lack of sleep and waking up and working at odd hours. How they can never truly take a break or go on vacation without worrying about the patients. There were days when I would get up and realise my parents have been gone all night, saving someone’s life. My parents have lunch in the morning because they have missed so any lunches because of cases. We have left many a movies because of emergencies and my parents have had to sacrifice their sleep on countless occasions.

I saw all that and realised I wanted an easier life. I didn’t want to lose sleep or be responsible for someone’s health and life. I wouldn’t see my parents for long periods of time because they were busy helping people like you, the same people who have gone from chanting ‘doctors are gods’ to ‘doctors are demons who should be publicly shamed and punished’. And as a daughter of doctors and a wife of one, but more importantly as a rational human being, I find the violence against doctors horrifying and callous.

In misguided google researches and hearsay from people who aren’t qualified to comment, people are starting to think it’s okay to blame doctors for everything that might go wrong, regardless of the reasons behind it. Doctors aren’t demons, but they aren’t gods either. They are people just like you and I, who work in a profession that saves lives and makes people better. It’s a job, like any other, where somehow it’s deemed unfair for doctors to want to earn money. When lives are at stake, doctors make the choice that they feel is best for the situation. That is what they are trained to do. That is what your friends and family who are doctors were still doing, long after you graduated and started earning.

A doctor has to put aside their feelings and emotions in the face of a medical treatment or a surgery. If they were to ‘feel’ for every patient, how would they ever get the job done? The medical profession itself requires objectivity and distance from the patient. The doctor is there to treat you, objectively and to the best of their knowledge. But a doctor is also a human being, with a family and values, just like you are. No doctor would want to do harm intentionally. Doctors don’t sit around discussing the best ways to fleece their patients for more money. They are performing a service for you and getting paid in return, just like any other job.

That said, are all doctors good? No. Just like every other field of work, there are good doctors and bad. And maybe you have to deal with a doctor who you felt wasn’t doing his/her job properly. But does that justify you boycotting the entire profession? Does that even come close to justifying the violent measure taken against doctors? NO. At the end of the day, I sigh in relief that I decided not to be a doctor. In the light of the attacks and violence, can you honestly expect doctors to show up to work for you, helping you? Easing your pain and ailments? When all of you stand by and watch this happen. Staying silent because it doesn’t affect you right now. Saying that all doctors are inhuman and greedy.

If any doctor has ever has helped you, you owe it to them to voice your protest and disapproval. If you feel like a mishap has happened or medical negligence, take it to court and let them decide. You cannot take matters into your own hands and be the judge, jury and executioner, not till you are also willing to take matters into your own hands and get the mob and google to do your treatment or surgery on you as well. If you can’t support doctors now, then maybe you shouldn’t go to one either.

1560946721,DeadRootsStirring,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c2g99w/rant_india_on_google_street_view/,9,14,,,[Rant] India on Google street view,"For how long will the government keep denying Google street view coverage in India, based on the so-called safety compromise, and the premise that it will be used to conduct terror attacks in India. Countries have had Google street view for years now, even countries with significantly lower development indices like Bangladesh, Bhutan, Uganda, Kenya and those with terror risks, like Israel, USA, Jordan have coverage. It is not that these countries are bombed daily by terrorists.   


I remember reading that Google had collected Street view data in Mumbai and Bangalore as early as 2011, which has still not been published. Google does a fantastic job of even blurring away numberplates and user faces, so there is no question of privacy breach as well. Street view even has an option for opting out of it (check German cities for example, many buildings are blurred out). China, even if it doesn't trust Google, has at least its own equivalent in Baidu Total View (which is accessible worldwide, may I add ). There was a ""swadeshi"" company that had launched similar coverage in 12 Indian cities ([https://www.businesstoday.in/technology/internet/12-indian-cities-get-street-view-but-its-not-from-google/story/199665.html](https://www.businesstoday.in/technology/internet/12-indian-cities-get-street-view-but-its-not-from-google/story/199665.html)), but it has also shut down.  


If taking photos in public is legal everywhere, why can't a company stitch these photos to create a service that is beneficial on so many different levels for the general populace? It makes travel so much easier, driving, planning for hotel reservations, renting a flat, checking out a new destination, checking quality of roads, journalism or even for randomly exploring new parts of the country... And its not like the government has to pay out of its own pocket for all of this!  


The ""neighbourhood wale over-conscious and vigilante uncle"" mentality of bureaucrats in India is denying us of so many things that people in other countries take for granted.   


Why even allow maps then? Keep banning every single thing that will facilitate terrorist movement. Terrorists will use them as well to naivgate and plan attacks in the country. Train tracking? Nope, what if terrorists ambush the train? Why even stop at that, ban mobile phones as well? *2 Terrorists ek dusre se plan discuss kiye toh?*

1560948740,LegendaryFalcon,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c2gpls/a_personal_take_on_the_west_bengal_medico_assault/,3,12,,,A personal take on the West Bengal medico assault and its aftermath,"The incident of assault had two victims; 1. the interns 2. the patients who suffered as a result of the ensuing strike. 

It's known that there is a fear of aggression from the patients' relatives in the minds of the doctors, especially among doctors serving in govt operated tertiary care centres. There are surveys out there indicating this. This is a poor situation, no doubt. Also, the working conditions there aren't that nice. So, how should this be addressed? The answer that immediately comes to the mind is - Government needs to do more, make workplace safer, put police out there in the wards to protect doctors from any possible physical harm while they do their job. This sounds plausible, but might be difficult to implement, as it entails placing manpower. So, what can be OK to implement and at the same time be effective. I have a suggestion (I welcome criticism), which is - government should pass a bill, an ordinance, per which anybody that gets physical with the care staff i.e, doctors, nurses, technicians, housekeeping etc, will not receive any medical treatment anywhere in the country going forward, in addition to punishment per penal provisions; that a database of such miscreants be created with a retrospective effect and be made available to all govt primary and tertiary care centres across the country for perusal, and that patients/relatives of patients need to sign an undertaking of no-mischief while seeking registration and treatment at any govt hospital. All this with immediate effect. This may have some effect in alleviating the fear from the minds of doctors, doctors who're no other people but us. This should make their workplace a little tension free. This is my suggestion. I can't think of any other effective measure save this.

Now, taking a deeper look at the incident, we see that the assault was perceived as an assault on every working doctor out there irrespective of location. Solidarity poured in from all corners of the medical fraternity and equally in measure from the general public, as well. This should be proof enough to doctors out there that the public at large are reasonable people who empathize with any victim of violence anywhere, more so when it's a medico. This should be a morale booster for aspiring medicos in our country. Now, medicos, too, need to be careful before engaging in strikes because a good number of innocent people suffered as a consequence. Some deaths, too, seem to have occurred on account of this. Again, they're intelligent people, and we should leave things to their own better judgment.

A totally personal opinion on the medical profession: Doctors are not God. Yes. Doctors sacrifice a lot to become qualified professionals. Agree. They have no personal life. Agree. Doctors attend work at odd hours. Yes. But, there are certain things that need to be acknowledged in the same spirit and at the same time. Amongst the lakhs of doctors in this country, only a handful ever chose willfully to serve people in some remote place. There're just a few who solely desired to serve humanity. For the majority, it always is/was a good choice of career. Agreed that they're human beings, and they've their own aspirations, but nobody's denying that, ever. People are free to do per their own free will. But, no doctor occupies a pedestal just by virtue of being one. I'll rate a social worker higher to a salaried doctor any day, for obvious reasons. That doctors save lives; yes, and again it's the doctors exactly who tell me that CPR works only 5 times out of 100. Yes, it's a noble profession, but I see nobleness in only a scant few, the majority are simply professionals. That they make us feel better; yes, but if it's only at a payment, then I don't see any greatness in it. I absolutely have a soft corner for some doctors at govt hospitals who do a tremendous job treating the poor and the uneducated. Have seen it with my own eyes. But, not all of them though. 

It's the level of humanity inside a qualified doctor that makes him eligible for greatness. Just being so never does. If we are to condemn violence, let's condemn violence on everybody, everywhere. Why limit it just to doctors. The injured intern has my sympathies, but so do all the people who do risky jobs. **Doctors should acknowledge the fact that people personally thank them for doing their job, a monetary consideration notwithstanding, and there are people out there who do hazardous, thankless jobs but live in penury and obscurity**.

However, the content see no improvement at all. It was awful and continues to be. I personally used to pay 400 rupees a month for all the channels back in September 2018, today paying around 800 for lesser channels. Some of the channels are free and some vary between paises to 2x rupees. My opinion is that TRAI should come up with a rule in keeping the maximum amount per channel if they are showing advertisements to its viewers. Channels should be at their wish to charge as much as they want, if they do not show ads. You can't show me ads for 20 minutes during a 1 hour show and expect me to pay as well! Imagine ads being inserted in Spotify premium or Netflix. I think TRAI should give 3 options to the broadcasters.

1. Keep the channel FREE and run as many advertisements you want.

2. Keep the cost below 4-5 rupees and show ads like 15-20 minutes in an hour.

3. Fix the pricing as much as you want but dare not show any ads.

I think it's only fair to ask this. Your opinion suggestions are welcome. Let me know if there is any way to send this suggestion to TRAI",c2jv8l,,false,/r/india/comments/c2jv8l/my_opinion_after_trais_dth_fiddling/,Non-Political

1560982017,Arfys,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c2ng4v/recommendations_for_a_good_family_therapy/,5,12,,,Recommendations for a good family therapy psychologist?,"My family's been in a rough spot for several years. My dad, though he was a great guy, had anger issues. The usual that stem from a doting and traditional mother. He's dead now, but the anger issues in the family persist. I was young when he died, and being the youngest of the family, I wasn't really faced with his abusive side. My sister and mother, however, were, and they've got a host of anger issues that come out randomly over the most trivial things. 

**Family**

We are a nuclear family. All the elders are dead, so my mother is effectively the matriarch. We're independent, and unlike traditional familes, don't really set some time aside to spend with each other. They are very supportive and very loving; and I feel that as long the subject is not them, or you don't criticise their actions in any way; they tend to be in that 'loving family mode'. 

This unravels when the fights start, and everyone tries their damned best to hurt each other in the worst way possible. I can't say I'm not guilty of that as well, but I prefer deescalation, and I've noticed that fight with my family members always escalate beyond the original, mostly stupid arguments. There's always a lot of shouting, though everyone just says the other started it. 

\- Sister becomes angry because of some perceived slight against her, she's always correcting or interrupting mother, she likes to be loved and is good with people but talks bad behind their backs. She usually becomes violently angry, though there has never been a physical fight. 

\- I always retaliate, oft-times unnecessarily. I generally know that will probably result in a bigger fight. I have a quick temper, and my voice can be a bit loud when I'm angry. My anger's triggered when someone berates me for some flaw I have. I am insecure about a lot of things, many of which my family knows. I tend to say very hurtful things when the family tries to hurt me using those. 

\- Mother has the most tolerance of all, but when she does get angry, it's bad. When I was little, she used to beat me, but since father died, she's mellowed out. She shouts a lot, threatens (only that) to do something rash to just end the argument, like throwing out a book, or destroying the thing being argued about, etc. Then she goes into self pity mode and that's saddest of all. Some of her lines are: ""Of course I'm in the wrong, you've grown up and become so *intelligent.*"" ""I'm the worst, it's all my fault that I couldn't even teach my kids/couldn't understand my kids"" I sometimes think it's dramatic exaggeration, but with this kind of dynamic anyone would get frustrated.

&amp;#x200B;

Everything's always forgotten by the next day. A week is the most we've given each other the silent treatment.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't really figure out what's causing this dynamic. I think some possible factors may be:

* Father had trouble with anger management, due to his background, and he passed it on to his wife and children.
* Me and sister are narcissists and really only care about ourselves. We play good when it's convenient and fight with each other and mother when it's not.
* Sister has an inferiority complex of some sort and lots of triggers, and we accidentally trigger her. It's weird, because it's never clear what will trigger her. One minute you're laughing, the other you're screaming yourself hoarse.
* There is some underlying tension or another reason. Maybe father's death (almost 10 years ago) affected us in ways we couldn't imagine?
* I have anxiety and this always colors my long term relationships with other people. My family doesn't know a lot of things about me. I feel I'm a terribly incompetent buffoon and they're fools for believing in me. Maybe I am getting overly defensive when they insult me in anger on some sensitive things because I think they're intended to be more hurtful than they actually are.
* We don't love each other (I \*really\* doubt this), and/or are embarrassed of each other for various reasons. This is because we're always pointing out flaws in each other. 
* Since we don't do any family activities (no eating dinner together, no watching tv together, no lengthy talks that are not focused on a particular subject unrelated to family), we have drifted apart and really the only thing binding us is that we're family and that family is supposed to love each other.

Tbh I'm not sure about my feeling myself. I've never loved anyone that wasn't my family, so I can't tell if I love them or not. I think I do. This all is so terribly confusing and sad. 

Mother's getting old. I don't want the rest of her days to be spent like this. I think the family can get better with some family therapy, to talk about what upsets us, what angers us, our insecurities, etc. in a controlled environment. I tried to do it myself, but no one takes it seriously. I think they might if it's a professional talking, not the youngest member of the family.

&amp;#x200B;

Are there some good psychologists in India that are good with family therapies and can help us deal with these problems? Location doesn't matter, but someone in Delhi, Lucknow, Mumbai, or Bangalore would be preferred. Please let me know if there's some recommendation you people have for me that could help ease our family dynamics.

Last week by brother decided to bring his girlfriend to our house so me and my mother could meet her.

Before I say anything else I want you to know that the other sides of my family are conservative, no exceptions even many of their kids are like that.

So he brings his girlfriend in and about 30-40 minutes later our elder cousin walks in the house , he sees the girl and my mom explains to him that it is my brother's girlfriend. Without saying anything my cousin leaves and we brush it off as nothing.

2 days later my whole family is shitting on my mother , father and me also my brother for having a girlfriend at such a young age and saying that he is a delinquent and is sinning , they call out us on stuff that shouldn't be mistake like how me and my brothers are aethists. We have blocked all the numbers on his mobile because he was getting bad texts from our family.

I wanted to ask if there's something wrong that our family can't see with having a girlfriend at 15 years old ?

Two wheelers, Private car drivers, Taxi walas,  Vans, Autos and last but not least BMTC drivers  all are driving like as there is no tomorrow. Following rules is least priority.  They don't even know that they are causing inconvenience to others . Jumping signals, riding in one way/wrong way, parking wherever they want, no lane discipline what so ever , not using indicator, using horns like maniacs. 

I am  sorry this is only about the drivers who drive senseless. Not mentioning anyone in common. But I'm tired of cussing, tired of complaining, tired of the non-sense. 

 

I live in Bangalore for more than 15 years and year on year the driving sense of people is becoming worse.  I 'm a sedate driver, trying to follow the traffic rules almost 99% and very careful not cause any inconvenience to others on road. Even I got scolded couple of times for my attitude. 

I am worried about the next generation, as they are very much careless about the traffic sense/rules.  Even basic rules like, keep left, stop at red, lane discipline, don't drive on no entry, don't park on no parking zone, etc are violated largely.

People dont understand they are only causing the jams.  I don't want to brag about  Bangalore Traffic police, already they are outnumbered, also it's impossible for them impose these rules on each and every one. I think that's why they turned their attitude from traffic management to fine management. It's not the pothole filled roads or less infrastructure causing the trouble, but it is people. 

Anyone is in same boat ? How are you overcoming this?  Any hope we can drive safely in Bangalore in near future ?",bwn4hd,,false,/r/india/comments/bwn4hd/ranting_on_bangalore_drivers_xpost_from/,Non-Political

I couldn't legally contest the elections, so I made a website instead! It's got lots of opinion pieces by teenagers. A few of them had to go anon because they couldn't take the chance that their parents or someone who knows them would read it. It's really sad, actually.

Here's the link to the website: [*AcingSexEd.com*](https://AcingSexEd.com)

I really think sex education needs to be added to the preexisting five core subjects already at school. Some kids are ashamed of **completely normal** things like masturbating, others can't take birth control pills because their parents might find them and go nuclear on them.

I'd love nothing more than your support, even if it is just a cursory glance at the website. Every view counts. If you can, try to spread some information about it. Or just talk to someone about it. Raise some awareness.

Ciao!

Whenever a girl/boy reaches the so-called marriageable age these morons start with their preaching about how marriage gives happiness, how kids are important (look at our population damn you) etc etc. 

It is like a vicious cycle. These people pressurize the parents, the parents in turn pressurize their children, and some of them give in unable to withstand the mental torture. 

And no, it doesn't stop at marriage. 

Once marriage is over they start with the next one- oh when are you having kids? This time the pressure point is from two sides (both from one's parents and one's in-laws).

And if you criticize them, then it is - oh they are older than you, you should listen to them. 

This whole culture of not questioning the elders is so toxic and has led so many people to making life choices they otherwise would never have made. 

And has a part in the current situation of the country stemming from overpopulation.. (I would love to see the results in case someone does study this). 

People marrying without being ready, people having kids before they are ready sinking into debts, people ostracized over being single - the list is too long.

Behenchods, madarchods and several other hindi curse words were muted. In a scene where Shahid flips someone the finger, his whole hand is blurred. But weirdly enough, lots of occurences of the word ""fuck"" were not censored.  
Why is this so? Why does the CBFC get to decide what I watch? Isn't their job just to certify? Also, why does the director even agree to the censorship when the movie is already getting an A certificate?

 Just as I am about to graduate, I get an opportunity to study in China, and China’s policy for foreign students is tuition-free, and there are 20,000 scholarships each year.
 At this time, my brother told to me: ""China is also a developing country. The level of consumption is also very low. Our uncle is doing medical equipment business in Yiwu, China. You can also try it.""
 When I was confused, I followed my brother's advice and set off to study in China.

 Learning Chinese is not difficult at all, and oral Chinese is much easier. I was studying in Hangzhou, so I have visited around Zhejiang. 
 When I visited my uncle, I learned about the company him worked with, called Sunny world medical. I search it in google. I was very envious of my uncle, I wondered that I will become a millionaire just like my uncle after graduation. 
Now that India’s economy is improving day by day, people’s demand of medical care is even greater.
 So I took the opportunity to contact the medical device company named Sunny world medical in China.  I borrowed money from my uncle and contacted sunny world medical to place an order.
 This simple operation made me earn more than 20,000 CNY, nearly four times of the profit!

 At this time, I met a Vietnamese girl named ""Mary "". Her Chinese is better than me. I really like to study with her in the library.  Just then, a Pakistani man appeared.  After he came, Mary started  pay less attention to me day by day.
 I took this opportunity to express my confession, but she sent a text message saying that I am a loser, a social failure! This is really irritating!
 I am a South Indian, only 5 feet 5 inches tall. The Pakistani guy is 6 feet 4 feet tall.
 Mary must have dismissed my short. However, as a man, it is useless to be tall. What is important is how high his ambition is!
 So I worked hard and made another 60,000CNY in the previous method, and then I was only 22 years old!

 Thanks to the lack of the Indian market's large demand for the medical device industry, thanks to the sincerely Sunny world medical. Now, I am holding the tall Chinese girlfriend ,Sofia, I am no longer feel sorry about my own sense of failure. Because a man doesn’t depend on how tall he is, but how tall his wallet is.
 But sometimes ,especially at the midnight,i still miss Mary. What does she do? Does she happy? It not because how much i love her, but i love the most marvelous moment of myself.",c629ts,,false,/r/india/comments/c629ts/talk_to_you_guys_about_my_life_in_china/,Non-Political

I'm currently in Mussoorie and there's this stall I've been frequenting - I've eaten here 3 times now since I arrived and it's called Uphar Restaurant. THEIR MIXED UTTAPUM IS THE BEST.

I came here today at about 5pm and it was getting increasingly crowded. As I was alone, I asked the staff where I should sit and he told me to just sit at the empty seat for four.

While waiting for my food, a couple (in their 40/50s) were searching for a seat and almost left as all the tables were occupied. I told them they could join me, and so we all sat together.

It was akward at first, but I decided to break the silence and asked them if they were here for a holiday. They told me that they were from Delhi and here for vacation. They also have a son around my age, currently doing his internship in the US.

My food took longer to come, and they even asked me to try their food while waiting.

We chatted here and there, and I could see that they were very interested in me - maybe because I'm kinda like their son: in a foreign country away from home and all alone.

They eventually finished first and before they left, they told me they PAID FOR MY MEAL and told me not to pay later. I know it wasn't a lot, but I know for sure if it was me, I wouldn't have paid for a stranger's meal - one I met just 15 minutes ago.

They wished me all the best with my travels and told me to stay safe.

I wish I had remembered to ask for their contact so I can show them around my country if they ever come. Walked around the mall a bit but couldn't find them there. Hopefully I'll bump into them again tomorrow!

I'm super blessed to occasionally get such great encounters while travelling and I thought I should share them (especially since I just found this sub). I hope this brightens your day, like it did to mine!

A young Indian, who likely consumed a lot of scarce Indian resources in the process of becoming a highly skilled worker, will go and provide all the benefit of those skills in the US. And its mostly the best workers that take this route. The sub-par ones will remain behind. Seems like a loss for us on every front.

Yes, I know we get a lot of money through remittances, but surely that can't be more than what we would get if the highly skilled worker spent his entire productive life here.

Hey guys,
So I see a lot posts about someone being in depression and aren't sure what to do and seeking help. This is probably similar if not same.

About me, am 29 year old dude without any idea of what passion is or what kind of career I want to have. I have the most self absorbed parents who literally made every decision for me all the time. Hence, here I stand without a single clue on what I want to do and with marriage and constant pressure of joining the family business thrown at me everyday.

I am now forced into an internship in a foreign land where I am literally learning nothing about the nature of my family business nor anything on general that will give me confidence that I can be a part of said business. (I have tried to do self studies and online courses on supply chain, which is what the business is based and I honestly don't find it interesting)

Am I depressed? Possibly. Am I suicidal? Maybe. Everytime I don't have a distraction in front of me all I think of is to kill myself and just stop this shithole of life. I don't have a lot of friends, am sort of awkward around people and largely I don't have anything that is me anymore, I doubt and analyse everything that I do or like to figure out if I actually like it, or if I am used it.

I Know a lot of you will say, ""man just take a stand and do what you want, you are 29""; which is valid, I don't know why but I have never been a ""take a stand kind of person"" , plus it's not like my parents are abusive physically that I wanted to run away or something. It was just I hoped I could make them understand, but they never have and I think with the way things are going, they never will.

Coming to why am writing this, look I know it's a lot to ask for and I don't know if it's allowed either, am done man, I know if I don't run away now, I won't last this year, I feel it(bit cringey but I actually do), I was hoping to put myself out there if anybody is listening/reading and ask for a job. Am ready at this point to do anything, I'll work as anything, I don't mind salary, level or whatever.(I only have one request that it's as far from Bangalore as possible)

I have experience but I just couldn't get jobs for the last few months because I was either clueless on what to apply or my crippling low self confidence. 

If anyone is interested, I have worked in a startup for a couple of years and I know sql and some basic analytics. I have been told am a quick learner so I guess am totally not useless.

I really want to runaway, but I just need a job or something that keeps me busy, I know there are delivery jobs or I can just find something anywhere, I don't know of it makes sense, I guess the assurance of a job gives me the confidence to take that step.

If anyone wants to talk, please dm me, and I'll give my resume if you think am a good fit anywhere.(I know asking a lot, and I don't know what else to do at this moment). Other than that, just thanks for hearing me out I guess",c6c2ws,,false,/r/india/comments/c6c2ws/a_way_out_hopefully/,Non-Political

Serious answers please.,"As most of you know, India is notorious for being the land of “send bobs and vagene” and sending “can we be frand” msgs to random girls on the internet. 

My constructive reaction to this so far has simply been to reply to those guys myself and admonish them for making the girls uncomfortable and trying to explain to them that it’s a poor way of trying to engage in conversation with a girl. Not to mention unrealistic, cause you’re giving nothing to the girl to get her interested in you. You’re literally begging them for attention.

But what can we as a society do about this? How can we create a positive movement throughout the nation that makes these guys stop making strangers on the internet uncomfortable? Do we need to create skits, YouTube videos, school plays, social skills classes? If yes, do you mind sharing your ideas here? I do know that we need to target their lack of self awareness, and their ability to think from other people’s point of view.

##Thanks for the Platinum Reddit stranger

**Intro** - *Please read the edits too.*

**Prologue** - *The following post is written in no way to justify the actions of crass men who exist in our society and unfortunately it's quite shameful for even us that such men exist who harrass women and make their lives hell. Even I am not perfect and have my own flaws. I have written it at start and not at the end edit part so that people atleast read this and not call me misogynist, sexist pig who has written this for petty karma or gilding without reading. Or even call me someone who would brag about his masculinity and inflated ego.*

Now coming to the main part as to how-if not most-many women treat mediocre/average guys when they approach the ladies after practising what to say and shitting their pants. This hit me yesterday when someone said why are you taking it personally, well if someone tells their side of the story maybe it's time for me to also tell the least discussed opposite side of the coin.

Before I start let me tell you a small life story of my first proposal that till today taught me a lot. A month or two before exams a few of neighborhood friends and me decided to take private group tuitions. This is where I met my crush. So after boards, JEE mains and advanced and BITSAT all had ended we used to hang out a bit often. One day while we came back from lunch because her birthday's party was due, I told her that I had developed something for her that I couldn't explain. She said she got to know by my actions and a very caring attitude and treatment. So I still remember we were D block parking, CP where she told me these lines that I try to quote nearly what I remember. ""I have no feelings for you and I have to say NO to you. It might hurt you today but you'll remember me for good."" 
That moment was the most heartbreaking moment for me, I won't lie I didn't say a word, left her alone there, took a metro and came back home. On the way back I deleted her number, deleted the message chat on my Nokia. I accepted her decision, though I cried but did accept. After about 10-12 days we meet, I have no feelings for her anymore like 85% were dead, 15% remained because she was my crush. She hugged me and said sorry for she was rude(which she wasn't) and I too said sorry for leaving her alone and coming back home and deleting her number and everything immature I did. 

So to this day we are great friends and she has been an amazing advisor to me. How did that happen? It's because she didn't keep me on strings and told me one word i.e. **NO**. She didn't make pathetic excuses, kept me on hold or played with my emotions. What if she had played with me? I couldn't answer that but eventually found out as I grew up.

Jumping back to the present stage. A few weeks backs I announced at the LNRDT that I am going on my first date after a long time. I was really excited. I trimmed my hair, shaved my beard, chose perfect shirt and jeans and took out my new sneakers. Told mom I was going on my X friend's birthday in a cafe in CP. Though she might have guessed it's entirely a different story. I get a WhatsApp maybe hour or so before leaving that due to hot weather she can't make it as her parents aren't allowing. I thought it might be genuine concern and then said let's catch-up someday evening. I was pretty much sad but somehow consoled myself that it's just being shifted and not being cancelled. That's when things started to get shady. She gradually stopped reply to my texts and when I finally asked her about 10 days later why is she playing with me and ghosting me she told me ""She was sorry to play around me, but she had found someone else who was more compatible and *taller* than me."" I said ok bye. I hung up, deleted her chats and number and remembered the my first rejection.

Here comes the main part how we (addressing mediocre and average looking men) are treated by women who are significantly out of our aukat. 

* When you try to hit on them or even ask them out instead of telling **NO** they play along. They emotionally drain us and make us feel that even though we are shit as compared to them, still if we improve ourselves we can become capable of dating them. In the meanwhile they use our goodness and services and we act as their butlers, keeping track of their lives, sharing their happiness and being with them in their times of hardship. 
* Then when they feel we have improved ourselves and get ready to propose again with much confidence and improvements, they drop the emotional blackmail bomb. They simply address it by saying that ""What if we break up, what if we aren't compatible, what if we fight"", and so many guilt trip giving queries. Then drops the nuclear missile, ""See I don't want to lose a caring human being like you, in these few days we have become more like best friends but not a couple.""
* The guys pretty much get into the guilty feeling of losing such an amazing human being in life and settle for sticking around as a friend killing all the feelings after being put on strings and never told a straight forward NO.
* Poor guys like us don't even get a clue that it was never going to happen. It was just a way of slowly controlling us like a puppet to have their way.
* Even if the above scenario doesn't take place, it's alternative takes place. Where comes in the close friends WhatsApp groups that has screenshots of the guys pictures, all chats and girls mocking how that guy doesn't her standards and too average to be presentable. Instead of again telling a **NO** game is played, excuses are built up and a whole circle of the same activity takes place, where eventually the guy suffers as he is emotionally drained, stuck in between like a dhobi ka kutta (washerman's dog). Can't even get away from her because friendship and can't even come closer because standards don't match and he is kept for entertainment purposes.
* Or if you are a bit above average like my friend and you get a proposal and you turn it down straightway saying you aren't interested, the girl says she is going to take her life and then your life again gets in hell. Or you fall into the trap of dating someone who just broke up and dates you to be her emotional punching bag.

What's one thing common here? Selective biasness or as someone pointed out the Halo Effect. 

&gt; The halo effect is a cognitive bias that causes one trait (e.g., beauty) to drastically color your perception of all other traits. If you think someone is beautiful, you are also likely to assume they’re smart, ambitious, interesting, etc.

Simply saying it means that if a guy is good looking he is smart, trustworthy and compatible. But if a guy is average/mediocre he doesn't match your standards, would turn out to be creepy and even clingy.

That's why ladies readily accept a good looking guy, but keeps the average looking guy on hold/strings. Where she is the captain of his emotions. She will decide whether his feelings should stay or get killed. She won't ever say straightway **NO** but play and give excuses, stall, keep the person on strings. Till he is emotionally drained, mentally exhausted and aggression grips him. 

But see our plight you know, even though both good looking and mediocre looking people belong to the gender shared by rapists, harrassers, assaulter etc, who gets instantly blacklisted quite a few times? The mediocre looking guy and good looking guy gets a free pass . And it's not just my story, it the story of countless people who are termed as lifeless virgins nowadays. 

I know women go through the major hardships but when they are asked why didn't they say **NO**, they say because they don't want to be at the receiving end of the outcome. Well no denying they have to deal with psychos, but also they get out of that situation easily by always making the same excuse. For that no one would blame them thanks to such crass people who share the same gender with us. Who ends up at the real receiving end? Ofcourse the average looking guys. Because we don't have anything of our own after we propose or luckily get into a relationship with a woman up a higher notch. She is the holder of our emotions, she can blackmail us easily because we aren't her level and she has done a massive favour for us. She controls us emotionally and mentally. And in that process we get torn into bits and pieces. **The excuses and keeping us on strings where straightway a harsh and hurting truth in form of NO, could have been told, we get more agressive and much more fanatic. Getting in a relationship becomes an obsession because we are drained of emotions and love and affection is all we need.**

Thinking of all my dates and talking to my friends yesterday one things is clear, how to get a bit of love and affection, we give up a huge part of our emotional self. Where instead of giving ourselves and our families and friends importance we get trapped and give someone the importance and limelight who is just there to play around and fiddle with us. For women they can easily say they don't trust men but what can we say? Nothing? We are just played along the way and blamed eventually for all things that we do and even might not have done ever.

**And weird part is nearly everyone I talked to from a few friends to Reddit strangers** have gone through same shit, but it never comes to light because we are the tough gender. Handling rejections shouldn't be a huge task for us. How to tell handling rejections would have been easier if it was a simple NO and not a game of snakes and ladders. It's somewhere our fault too that we fail to take note of all that glitters is not gold kind of situation. That we fail to move on rather than going down the spiral. Is a straight NO too much to ask for? Are we such low class begins that telling us **NO** on face has such negative impact?

I don't know how people will respond to me, maybe I get downvoted, maybe I get abused, maybe I get called out for shifting the blame or anything. But one thing for sure is I feel somewhat sad and happy at the same time while writing this down. Sad because I couldn't take control of the situations even though my intuition said so and happy because I could tell the least discussed side of my lives.

**What's the way out? Simple, rather than being someone's dog on leash, live your life alone with friends and family and do arranged marriage at the end. Because you don't have those attractive genes and inner beauty matters shit when you only seen to be a friendship material.**

PS - While saving this it made me realise how quite a lot of us get ill treated and never have the courage to speak out but at the same time I realised, **HOW WE ILL TREAT WOMEN AT TIMES TOO IN THE NAME OF FORCED LOVE AND AFFECTION. AND I WANT TO APOLOGIZE IF I HAVE EVEN FOR A MOMENT ILL TREATED SOMEONE.**

##Thanks to my crush for making me stronger and more emotionally sound as a human being to handle rejections better and part ways with someone who isn't available to share her feelings

Edit 1: Don't abuse anyone, I have written this post from all your experiences, so be a bit more sensible and even if girls comment something let them comment and read their views as well. We have to be a bit courteous fellas.

**Edit 2: People saying you get played because of kindness and all. I have seen enough shit so I don't fall for it now because of my experience and people around me who advice me. But for people who are alone and no one to guide/advice them are blinded by emotions and you can't blame them at all. They aren't experienced much and this post might give them a harsh reality that they still might not accept.**

Edit 3: Please stop DMing me that everything will be alright. I am fine c'mon. I read between the lines now since my last date, so don't fall for that trap anymore probably. Help the helpless ones in comments. They need some guidance.

Edit 4: Thanks for that Silver ❤️

**Edit 5: This post is to tell you to move on. That if you feel stuck, time to get off and life your life with dedication towards yourself. IT'S AN EYE OPENER FOR YOU ALL. It's not at all about I am a nice guy, I should get women like fuckboys and handsome guys do. It's about learning about your flaws as well.**

Edit 6: Thanks for the Gold ❤️

Edit 7: I won't keep replying I am tired and have to do work as well. Atleast read the edits before you raise the same point.

**Edit 8: For women my message is simple, I know boys are shit and you don't always need to give them a NO because of your safety but atleast have enough courtesy to not play with their emotions. Don't keep him as a friend if you know he still has feelings for you and can rebound back. Let him go, don't make him feel guilty about himself.

How much was the ticket price in 1960? Wikipedia shows it made 11 crore in 1960.

For it to make 2000 crore at modern ticket price, its ticket price would have to be 1/180 of the modern ticket price. So Mughal E Azam's ticket price in 1960 would have to be around 1 rupee or lower.

Assuming it is at Rs 2000 crore at modern ticket price, it'd have to have sold at least 100M tickets in 1960 (assuming modern ticket price to be Rs 200 on average). Indian population in 1960 was 450M, so 100M tickets (with rewatches of course ) doesn't seem implausible considering the movie was a must-see event.",bzabd6,,false,/r/india/comments/bzabd6/did_mughal_e_azam_legit_make_rs_2000_crore/,Non-Political

Even if they connect, the speeds are too slow to even load a page within 2 mins making browsing a nightmare. Connection to VPN services are failing. Certain videos in YouTube suddenly stop playing leading to an endless buffer. It seems like the caching of YouTube in my local servers is being interrupted midway.

Sometimes these issues suddenly subside for about an hour and again come back. But the trend of these outages seems to be intentional rather than a network fault.

Is this a DNS thing? I don't think so. I've been using Google DNS since forever and I've just checked.

Everything else is just massively interruptive. Connecting sometimes and some other times, not. But the Reddit block is constant and absolute.

&amp;#x200B;

**Edit:** VPN is working now on optimal speeds. Still can't access Reddit without VPN.

**Edit 2:** YouTube is also working perfectly now. What is happening? I just made this post and everything seems to be going back to normal. Now, just Reddit is left to be unblocked and I'll have no complaints.

If she is not clearly interested in you, move on.

If she is playing hard to get, forget her. She's not worth your time.


If you want her to be a potential SO, and she doesn't reciprocate the feeling even if you explicitly made yourself clear, save some self respect and move on.


Get yourself busy with other productive stuff. And meet more girls if you want to get laid or get into relationship. There are millions of girls in India.

# Best Benefits

Among **1 GB/day** plans, **Rs. 399** pack is *the most efficient*.

Among **2 GB/day** plans, **Rs. 448** pack is *the most efficient*.

&amp;#x200B;

Data Volume-wise, the **2 GB/day** plan at **Rs. 448** is *more efficient* than **1.5 GB/day** plan at **Rs. 399**.

&amp;#x200B;

*Note: Some packs have been intentionally left out of the comparison since they are impractical (for e.g., 2GB/month at Rs. 98), or are obviously not cost efficient either way (long term packs such as Rs. 999 for 60 GB of data for 90 days).*

&amp;#x200B;

His profile seemed genuine, so I replied. I am a tech consultant and I told him the same thing. He then asked me if I would be interested in pursuing some ideas to work on aside from my job. I am honestly kind of a little bored from my day job, and don't really mind working on cool side projects, so I said yeah definitely, what do you have to offer? He then set up a meeting for today to 'discuss this idea'.

Come the meeting, I had just came back from office and tired, and was a little, uuuhh, underdressed. So I kept the video off on this meeting. He joined and asked me to switch on the video, I said I was wasn't expecting it to be a video call as he never told me it would be, so I can't switch on the video as Im not really presentable at the moment. He genuinely seemed offended by it (he still had his video on), and said to keep the video on for future meetings. That seemed weird, but whatever.

He then asked me what I do in my day job. (the way he asked it gave me the 'this-is-your-interview' vibes). I had looked at his profile, and apparently he works as a tech consultant himself somewhere in US, so I gave him a nice little brief about the technologies that I've been working on recently. He listened, but something about his body language was telling me he's not comfortable. He definitely had no experience of taking an interview, if that is what was going on.

He then asked me why I am interested in doing something else if I had a stable job. I said I was genuinely curious about what your 'idea' was, and wanted to listen to it. I can't be 'interested' in something that I don't know anything about. He very weirdly said that if it's just curiosity, then we can't move ahead with this.

Well, that's unfortunate.

I tried to make him understand that I don't even know what the fuck he's taking about, so I can't be interested. I tried to ask him in various different ways about this 'idea', but nope, nothing came out. He did say it was related to 'asset based income', and that he can't give more information unless I was willing to leave my job and go all in with this. And that's definitely not something that I had in mind with this.

We said our bye-byes, and I uninstalled the shady meeting app as soon as possible.

Surprised more people on this sub aren't aware of Libra's threat to India's monetary independence. The point of Libra is to have a financial ledger controlled by Facebook and other (non-Indian) corporations, which determines the savings balances of 2.4 billion Facebook users globally.  Units on that ledger would be drawn against a basked of dollars, euros, yen, and pounds, which means those Libra users would in effect own those currencies and use them to transact or store wealth.

India is home to the largest group of Facebook users in the world. However, India's currency, the rupee, is not represented in the Libra currency basket, which means if Indian users adopt Libra, they would create a shadow economy beyond regulatory reach (demonetization would not be possible) and which accelerates currency flight (by giving individuals a way to much more conveniently convert their salaries to foreign currency). Taken to an extreme, by sapping India's financial sector and exacerbating India's current account deficit, it could hobble India's finances to the same extent as Pakistan's is today.

It doesn't seem like the government has issued an opinion on this yet. What do you think they should do?",c4aoq5,,false,/r/india/comments/c4aoq5/libra_a_usd_eur_jpy_and_gbp_basket_could/,Policy/Economy

As i researched online I found out that I need a payment gateway and I need to obtain GST number, even before I started earning. 

People on the internet were asking 1000 just to register you on gst portal( it should be east like signing up on some website )

so I decided to watch some YouTube video and applied for it and go my GST number as well ( yay )

but later I got busy in college and couldn't work on the website, and I forgot about the whole GST thing.


yesterday I received a letter at my home that I haven't filed my GST return and there will be punishment and charges and I need to do pay the fee within 3 days, I was like but I didn't even started my business and haven't made any profit so what type of fee am i liable to pay?

So appertly you are required to file GST return every month ( some user thought when they opted for quarter return - they were liable to file every 3 month ) 
and the worst about monthly return is that I need to pay late fee for every single one.
Now I'm looking at total of 17000 late fee, for just an idea to test, and I'm feeling like a loser and stupid.
just if I have read about it more.


 I found many small business people online, some needed the gst number for some reason and now they were too looking at this big numbers of late fee.

The thing is I understand I was supposed to file return every month, but I got the letter yesterday after 8 months,  they could have sent an email or a sms? why wait 8 months.

the funny thing is I'm not the only one, people don't even know they supposed to file every month even if you are not making any sell. most of people don't understand who these things works so other people so called professional charge them, tax supposed to be simple, simple enough so general public can understand it. 

The way I see it, it's just a way to feed government. once the government got the taste of money the appetite only grew. ( yes I steal it from some book )


TLDR : registered for GST for a payment gateway registration, forgot about it, haven't file return, now looking at 17K late fee, blaming the govt for sending letter after 8 months but not even a email/sms.",c75z4z,,false,/r/india/comments/c75z4z/i_hate_indian_government_and_its_tax_system/,Policy/Economy

&gt; For women across the globe (we have teams in 13 countries as we speak), we will be offering 26 weeks paid leave, or will follow the government mandated policy, whichever is more. We will be offering exactly the same benefits to men as well. There won’t be even an iota of difference in parental leave policy for men and women at Zomato going forward.

&gt; This policy also applies to non birthing parents, and in cases of surrogacy, adoption, and same-sex partners.

Reason for this policy and it should be followed by other organisations. 

&gt; While we have been lucky to attract and nurture some of the strongest female leaders I have ever met, it has been incredibly hard to find women leaders out there at senior levels. Majority of the senior positions in the world are currently filled by men – and even if an organisation wants to focus on gender balance in the senior ranks within, it is almost impossible to do that because of the supply bias.

&gt; According to me, a lot of that imbalance at the top stems from an unequal leave policy for men and women when they welcome their children to this world. 

Vox did a great episode on Gender pay gap which is available on Netflix. Link - 
www.netflix.com/title/80216752?source=android , episode - ""Why women are paid less"". 

Those who want to read -  https://www.vox.com/2018/9/7/17828964/gender-wage-gap-explained-netflix

The video and the article referred to a research that argued that women are paid less not because the employer doesn't want to pay them equally BUT because they miss out on timely promotions or have to turn down opportunities which may advance their career because they choose to have kids while men don't have to make these choices. By giving men mandatory parental leave, a child birth will affect both the genders equally in career AND men can also provide the care in initial few months.

##Summary

This policy is easily the biggest change to the education system since the old policy came in. It is in many ways, entirely unrecognisable, while in many other ways, simply formalising what was informally already done.

The first and biggest change, is that primary education, from ages 3-6, is now a formal part of school education, and public school must offer this. The second change, what goes hand in hand, is the abolishing of the 10+2 system. In many ways, the 10+2 system completely ignored the way a student's mind developed, and thus made for a poor learning system. The new system is 5+3+3+4. These stages are as follows:

- 5 years of the Foundational Stage: 3 years of pre-primary school and Grades 1, 2.

- 3 years of the Preparatory (or Latter Primary) Stage: Grades 3, 4, 5.

- 3 years of the Middle (or Upper Primary) Stage: Grades 6, 7, 8.

- 4 years of the High (or Secondary) Stage: Grades 9, 10, 11, 12.

The new Foundational stage, is supposedly meant to be ""age fluid"". Your age does not matter, as long as you are within the age group 3-8. The Policy recommends that during the foundation stage there should be no textbook based education, and instead play based and activity based education. It also emphasises on introducing a variety of new ""stimuli"" to force children's brains to develop in a holistic manner. These stimuli include : music (classical or modern, both singing and listening), art (regional, national, sketching, etc.), literature (folk tales, literature from the region, and national quality authors, both modern and classical). This is a massive departure from the present system, and the new emphasis on arts, is excellent. To add to this, a new bilingual policy is introduced. Students who learn languages are shown to have much better cognitive abilities than those don't so the new system makes all students learn 2 languages right from the start. One of these has to be the mother tongue, in order to preserve it. The other language may vary by region and requirements. The three language policy remains, and will be better enforced. The final changes to the primary education, is the integration of ""anganwadis"" into schools, and shifting them from primarily health workers, to full scale trained teachers, satisfying the needs of the students. The NEP requires the full development of people-skills, through a variety of things like weekly assemblies and daily show-and-tells. This improves the speaking ability, something that IMO Indian students have historically been terrible at. New extras include group reading of stories, learning morality and ethics (along with a proper framework), puzzle solving of various types, etc. to make sure a child has a significantly better development. Students who fall behind are not left out, instead the teachers are required to identify and help them, as studies suggest that students who fall back early almost never recover.

The next ""Preparatory stage"" lays emphasis on shifting from a more informal style in the Foundation stage, to a more formal textbook oriented education, in the Middle stage. It is a bridge stage. Please not that the policy emphasises that any and all technical education *must* take place in the native language (mother tongue) first. This is because students who learn in their mother tongue have a noticeable advantage over those who learn in say English. The policy also has a very good write-up on why the emphasis on English has hurt India a lot. The preparatory stage also keeps this focus on arts, and expects students to fully develop other skills beyond the ""textbook education"". The policy also demands the abolishing of the so called ""co-curricular activities"" instead integrating them into the core curriculum. This makes things like PE, yoga, art, music, a core part of the education. It also requires that every student specialise in at least one of these subjects. Another new concept here is the selection of the best students to help the worst students. The best students are selected by the teacher, and then become part of a sort of ""national training system"".

The third stage is the ""Middle Stage"". By this time, the student's mind would have developed enough. It is now time to start the fully formal education. Subjects start splitting from generic versions into more detailed subjects (like science -&gt; physics + chemistry + biology). Students at this point will slowly start to also learn technical subjects in English. The idea is that students will be able to think in their mother tongue (which has a lot of advantages), while being able to understand and present ideas in English.

The fourth, and final stage is the ""High Stage"". At this point, students have developed a lot. Their mind now starts thinking in ""the bigger picture"" mode, and they can start planning for the rest of their life. In order to support this, students are now allowed to freely select courses and specialise. They are still required to understand and complete art courses, as this is paramount to their abilities, regardless of the final courses they choose.

Some important courses that come over the 12 years include : course on ethics and morality, Indian languages and their history and regional literature.

The next major changes come to the school management system. Schools can now form ""complexes"". A complex is comprised of nearby schools, such that each complex as a whole offers all of the above stages. Complexes are then given funds and other resources, like teachers. These resources may then be split up among the schools as necessary. This is important, because some types of teachers are relatively rare, and thus it provides optimal utilisation of resources. Sometimes other resources like libraries may also be shared. The exact details of what is shared will vary depending of the schools and their locality (population density, and ""backwardness"" of the population).

Schools also get a new level of autonomy, that was previously missing. Teachers are allowed to be the final deciders on the courses, and how they will be taught.

In order to improve attendance, the schools will do a number of things. Depending on the area, buses may be provided. Roads will be redone, so that transport is easier. Older students will be provided with free bicycles. The mid day meals will also be extended to offer basic breakfast to students. Adequate and safe infrastructure, including working toilets, clean drinking water, clean and attractive spaces conducive to learning, electricity, computing devices, and internet, will be important to provide to all schools.

To reduce inequality is a primary goal of the new policy. In order to do this, each school complex will have committee overseeing the demographics, and why students aren't attending. Specific groups called out include Muslims (for unwillingness to attend), and women in general. The policy requires that people of all castes and religions be integrated into the schools. The teachers are also required to emphasise on equality, by preventing acts that discriminate (e.g. not allowing SC/STs to sit with ""upper caste students"", etc.). The schools are required to join with the community in eradicating inequality. They are required to talk with parents and try and change their behaviour. This could be the groundwork to eliminating the reservation system. The policy sets the target of 2030, by which the majority of the students will be ""equalised"", not by pulling down the richer and higher caste, but by pulling up the poorer and downtrodden. Special Education Zones will be set up in disadvantaged regions across the country. The Central government will support extra investment and per-child expenditure in the ratio of 2:1 for each rupee spent by the State in these Zones. A special National Fund will be created specifically for providing scholarships and developing resources and facilities for students from Under Represented Groups.

The next set of changes are aimed at teachers. The primary aims are to improve teacher pay, and status in society. It recognises that teachers are already heavily burdened with a lot of work, so no government work may be offloaded onto teachers. They are also educated better, and stricter standards are set. Teachers are required to ""re-educate"" themselves by joining workshops, and the vertical mobility of teacher is to be improved. Teacher education will gradually be moved into multidisciplinary colleges and universities. By 2030, the minimum degree qualification for teaching will be a four-year liberal integrated B.Ed. degree that teaches a range of knowledge content and pedagogy.
Developmental opportunities, in the form of local, State, national, and international teaching and subject workshops, as well as online teacher development modules, will be available to all teachers. Substandard stand-alone Teacher Education Institutions (TEIs) across the country will be shut down as soon as possible. New teachers will have to register with an authority, and then will be quickly shifted into a school complex, for integration with the schools as necessary.

The next major changes comes to the testing system. The new system will be run by the National Testing Agency (which was newly set up in 2017 for entrance exams). They will be conducting the tests, and the new tests will be more like aptitude tests.  They will de-emphasise rote learning, instead encouraging an understanding of the subject. The policy claims that by 2020, all schools will have internet connected computers. It thus pushes for some degree of digitisation, by allowing for continuous evaluation through computers. Board exams in 10th and 12th are no longer. Instead we have exams in 3rd, 5th and 8th, called Census exams. The idea is to reduce the importance of Board exams. Teachers will also be more involved in the governance of schools and school complexes.

This policy also paves the way for better recognition of ""top talent"" students. For e.g. if a student is really good in Math, then they will be attending special summer schools to improve their performance. As already mentioned, top students are also required to tutor the students who are have a hard time coping. There is also a new emphasis on Olympiads. This should improve India's ranks in international competitions.

The RTE act sees some changes. It is now extended to the full duration of school, from ages 3-18. The RTE act itself will have to be reviewed, as the policy notes.

As for private institutions, there has been some misinformation. Private institutions will have to undergo some changes to have a similar system, so that they too can reach out to all students. The main changes are how fees is regulated. Fees needs to be rationalised, and can't be arbitrarily high. Once set, fee increments must go inline with inflation and reasonable increases, as opposed to random increases. Schools are also now required by law to be non-profit, and must be verified regularly by submitting all of their financial details. Private schools are also prohibited from having the word ""public"" in their name. So be prepared to see a lot of name changes.

Schools will now also be accredited and regulated in a slightly more free manner. However, they are required to release all details to the public. A framework and guidelines for ensuring school safety and security of children will be developed, and will be made a part of the eligibility conditions for a school education institution for recognition and registration. Every principal and teacher will be made aware of the provisions of the relevant Acts, Rules, Regulations, etc. relating to child rights, and what constitutes their violation, by including a module in the teachers’/principals’ education/training programmes and refresher courses. Self-learning online programmes on child rights will be developed for the benefit of students, teachers, and parents. Credible mechanisms for students to report breaches of their rights, and for appropriate actions to be taken against perpetrators, will be developed and implemented, in collaboration with local police. The Adolescent Education Programme and National Population Education Programme will be integrated into the curriculum of schools in a phased manner. (please note that Adolescent Education Programme is not sex education).

Also, in addition to all this, alternative forms of schools like gurukulas, patashalas, and madrassas will be encouraged, as long as they follow a modernised syllabus and are fully transparent.

The first changes will be implemented by 2020, with most major changes being in place by 2022. The first benefits will be seen by 2025, and by 2030, we should have fully transitioned, with all benefits in place.

##Comparison With the Current System:

The existing system failed primarily in 2 ways: Languages were poorly integrated, and many schools did not even offer three languages, as the policy notes. Hindi speaking states and TN were the primary offenders. Now all students are required to learn languages as per the Three Language Formula. The other way the old system failed was in testing. NCF (2005) laid heavy focus on eliminating rote learning, and in introducing a system where discovery based education was encouraged. The 10th grade NCERT textbook for science is a testament to that. Yet the system failed, because tests only cared about how well a student could mug up and vomit arbitrary facts. The new policy does try to fix this, but how much will improve remains to be seen.

The other more minor ways in which it failed was the integration of ""extra curricular"" subjects. Many schools actually refused to teach these subjects, considering them a time waste. The new system makes them a core part of the education system, so there should be an improvement.

Please discuss, and if you have any doubts, feel free to ask.

##TL;DR:

1. Learning to learn

2. Mother tongue as primary language of learning

3. Focus on trilingual policy, with English no longer as primary language

4. Equality of all students

https://i.redd.it/ykcmku81ji331.png

Recent events over the last few days have caused a bit of an outrage in the public area and rightly so. The arrest of journalist Prashant Kanojia has brought back to the forefront a 'jilted' provision amongst others that furthers the arbitrary and indiscriminate arrests of social media users. We join others in demanding his immediate release but are also further pressing for much needed policy and legal reforms.

With the formation of the new Government and our best foot forward, [**we write**](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Ke55RM0qMIVDS-acqL2A15p-gi2wAS5s) to Shri. Amit Shah, Minister of Home Affairs with a copy marked to Shri. Ravi Shankar Prasad, Minister of Electronics and Information Technology and Minister of Law and Justice.

The representation highlights the need for legal reforms in India to ensure freedom of speech and expression. With the continuously increasing number of Indians gaining access to the Internet, fear of unlawful prosecution and arrests only appear to be growing. This in all eventualities results in an incredible amount of self-censorship; a direction India seems to be moving towards similar to that of China. The repeal of criminal defamation and sedition is the need of the hour, more now so than ever before. Such a grand task can only be achieved with initiative by the Central Government of India to ensure momentum towards such reform.

A few steps moving forward for both temporary remedies and long term reform have been suggested in the representation.

* **Immediate steps:** Issue a detailed advisory to all State Governments cautioning against the use of criminal law to police free speech of social media users. Especially, arbitrary arrests.
* **Long-term systemic reform:** Operationalise the Law Commission of India to spearhead a comprehensive media and speech laws reform project with public participation.

We are optimistic that the necessary steps will be taken by the respective ministries in addressing these issues. Till then, IFF will continue to advocate for the rights of every Priyanka Sharma and Prashant Kanojia on the online platform of their choice.

## Highlights

* **Background:** The Draft Data Protection Bill was released for public consultation on August 14, 2018. While there have been several submissions, they were not made public. The Bill was not passed in the 2018 winter session of Parliament that it was initially introduced but press reports confirm it will be listed in this session of parliament.
* **Need for transparency:** As this Bill moves toward becoming law, concerns grow with the not only visibility of its current state but also with its pre-existing content. IFF writes to Minister of Electronics and Information Technology, Shri Ravi Shankar Prasad emphasising the need for transparency.

## Furthering the right kind of Privacy

The public consultation that took place in August 2018 for the Draft Personal Data Protection Bill, did not result with the submissions made by various stakeholders being made public. Essentially this defeats the purpose in providing information that would enable us to make better responses to any suggestions that would result in the dilution of privacy protections in India.

IFF filed two RTI’s with the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology on October 16, 2018 to understand the purpose in maintaining such secrecy. We asked for information of those who made submissions to the public consultation and the content of the submissions and if anyone else that may have aided the process of drafting the law or reviewing the submissions. However, we only received the number of submissions to the bill which was a total of 624, without their actual text being made public while the second query was blatantly rejected on the unavailability of information with the concerned Central Public Information Officer.

While awaiting responses to Second Appeals filed with the Central Information Commission, it seemed necessary to write to Hon'ble Shri. Ravi Shankar voicing our concerns ([Read about it here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3J0iAyRzCGxbFI0dVBEMlRSMEFfd244am9uaUs5blQ0eGhN)).

Our representation reiterates the need for transparency in the public consultation procedure. The Draft Personal Data Protection Bill will most definitely revolutionise the current state of the industry; this requires that the industry and various other stakeholders be made aware of the current state of the Bill that is intended to be passed by Parliament.

IFF will continue to advocate for the privacy of the Indian citizens, the first step in this journey is to ensure compliance with the Pre-legislative Consultation Policy formulated by the Cabinet of Secretaries. We request that the procedure set by the policy involving at the very least a summary of the submissions provided.

As we hope our request is given due consideration, IFF continues ensure data protection and privacy moves to forefront as is needed in this day and age.

The previous part dealt with the school level education, this part deals with reforms to the Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) and the relevant changes elsewhere. As before, this summary misses out a lot of key points, in the interest of brevity.

You can see the previous discussion and summary here: https://old.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bwb5ao/key_points_from_the_draft_new_education_policy/

Last time, I uploaded my notes as comments, but that was really clunky, so I have decided against doing that. Instead, I am uploading all my write-ups and notes to a GitHub page here: https://github.com/scarface-one/Draft-New-Education-Policy-2019

---
##Summary:

The NEP completely revamps the HEIs, like it did for the school level education. Unlike the school level education though, most of the changes here are unprecedented as far as India goes (they have been normal in other areas). Getting into the meat:

The major objectives here are to increase enrolment rates to 50% by 2035, and to increase the quality of institutions, research and students. The next major themes are giving increased autonomy to institutes, and increasing cross disciplinary courses (liberal arts). The latter is rather heavily emphasised throughout the document, and rightly so.

The first and foremost change is the entrance exams. HEIs are still allowed to conduct their own exams, but they are recommended to use the school results. The school level exams themselves have been taken over by the National Testing Agency (An agency under the MHRD, set up in 2018 to conduct JEE/NEET type exams). The new exams in the school level will be explicitly designed with the intent to test understanding and aptitude, so they should be better indicators of student performance, than boards + JEE/NEET, as has been the norm for so long.

The new system eliminates the older ""University"" nomenclature, in a bid for simplicity. Now, when an institute is a ""University"", it has to be a large institute, with a liberal arts focus, research centres and has to offer multiple courses. There are now three types of HEIs. These are:

1. Type 1: Research Universities

2. Type 2: Teaching Universities

3. Type 3: Colleges.

All existing Centrally funded institutes (IITs, IIITs, IIMs, NITs, IISc, AIIMS, etc.) will be converted to Type 1 universities. All existing colleges/universities will have to convert into the new system. They will have to select their own path, using Independent Development Goals (IDG), set by their top brass. Affiliated colleges will either have to merge with other colleges, or become fully independent. Similarly affiliated universities must become independent. Newer colleges set up after 2020 must follow these norms, and existing colleges have time until 2030 to transform.

The new accreditation and regulation system eliminates a lot of red tape, making running colleges easier. After 2030, accreditation will no longer be ranked. Instead, it will binary (accredited and non-accredited).

The focus in on multidisciplinary colleges to try and expose students to a variety of streams. Also, in line with the new school policy, the students are expected to continue in at least one of arts, literature, music, sports, etc. There is also more flexibility on courses, so you can technically finish courses faster or slower than the official duration (depends on the institute).

New Centrally funded institutes will be built in states willing to offer large amounts of land (2000 acres or more). These will be called Multidisciplinary Education and Research Universities (MERUs). They will offer Multidisciplinary Education, as the name suggests, with a strong focus on liberal arts.

There are two missions called Missions Nalanda and Takshashila. The missions come under the new RSA. Mission Nalanda aims to bring in 100 Type 1, 500 Type 2 HEIs into the country by 2030. Mission Takshasila aims to bring in one high quality HEI per district, with at least 2 or 3 in districts with higher populations. The institutions set up under these missions will be funded by the central government and state governments.

The new research focus ought to improve our universities. A National Research Fund will be set up, which will fund research. It will select research projects based on merit, with an independent board. In addition, universities will be encouraged to collaborate with each other, to reduce resource constraints on research projects, and to improve the quality of research. Access to research and journals will be improved (presumably through the National Digital Library). The NRF will hold conferences where the best new research will be discussed.

Another core concept is community service. All institutes are required to involve with the local community, to try and improve the quality of life. An NSS type system will also be mandatory for all students.

The NEP also calls for almost complete autonomy of institutions and faculty, in setting courses and curriculum. This should allow for more tailored courses, and universities that have a more unique flavour in their programmes.

Online Distance Learning courses will be funded and encouraged. The aim is to use these to make more students avail education, especially those who are socio-economically disadvantaged. In order to reach the 50% target GER, it is estimated that ODL must be used extensively. All universities may use platforms like Swayam, or set up their own digital education repositories. The educational material must be under a creative commons license, and must be publicly available. The best faculty from each university will be required to conduct ODL courses.

Students who wish to go abroad for higher education will be encouraged, so that the constraints on national resources are reduced. In addition to this, the work with international universities should improve the quality of Indian students. The aim is to make Indians capable global citizens. In addition, those who want to study in India from abroad will also be encouraged. Universities in India will also be encouraged to work with international universities in exchange programmes and research. Universities in India will also be encouraged to set up global campuses. Similarly, the best 200 universities will be encouraged to set up campuses in India. NRF will have dedicated funds for collaborations with foreign universities. In addition, local colleges/universities will not have to take the permission of the UGC or similar bodies to start collaboration. They now have full autonomy to do so on their own.

Foreign students will also be encouraged to study in India. 15% supernumerary seats will be reserved for foreign students. Students from abroad will be required to take basic courses on Indian history and Indian languages, to learn about India and its culture.

To improve teaching quality, faculty will be given more leeway on how to teach. In addition, they will also be given tenure, and priority will be given to find permanent faculty, as opposed to the current system. All HEIs will also have to work on improving basic infrastructure available. Teacher Education will move into multidimensional institutes, to give teachers better perspective. A link between HEIs and School complexes will be created.

The Medical field will also get a nice overhaul. Most district government hospitals will be converted to teaching hospitals ASAP. Requirements for nurses will be more rigorous, the Ph.D system will be changed. To complete MBBS, all students will now have a common ""exit exam"" to gauge quality properly.

All universities/colleges will also form a new Board of Governors, if they don't have one already. This board will steer the institution, with it being responsible for the success/failure of the institutions. The institutions, public and private, will all be publicly accountable. The greater autonomy also grants them the ability to set fees as they see necessary. However, they must all offer scholarships to socio-economically wearer students. At least 50% of all students must have gotten anywhere between 25-100% fee waiver, and out of that at least 20% must have gotten a full 100% fee waiver. Fee increments must also not affect batches, and must be fully transparent.

Keeping with the theme of autonomy and better regulation, most of the current governing institutions will be completely changed. A new institution, called National Higher Education Regulatory Authority (NHERA) will be the only regulator. A separate Higher Education Grants Commission (HEGC) will be set up. This splits the current UGC, making their roles and duties clear. Current institutions like NCTE, MCI, BCI, AICTE will give up regulatory authority, and instead become guiding authorities. This will happen within the next 5 years.

Language was a very controversial topic in the student section. For HEIs, colleges are free to do as they please with language. Most will likely stick to English, as it is today. The only difference will be for law schools. In lower courts, the preferred language is the local language. Hence law schools will be required to teach bilingually.

##Comparison With the Current System

In many ways a lot of what is proposed here were already followed in central institutions. IITs, IIITs, etc. have always been very autonomous, and have followed most of the regulatory principles mentioned here. The NEP simply pushes those values into *every* HEI.

The really new things are the increased funding, and the new multidisciplinary, liberal arts approach. This was a real problem in Indian HEIs, and the NEP should really help in making more well rounded individuals, even in the higher levels. The removal of focus on exams as the end all be all, should reduce unnecessary stress and pressure on students. It will also discourage the current Kota type crazy systems which push students to suicide.

The increased interactions with foreign universities and students should also prove to be beneficial. It will give students a better taste of foreign cultures. It will also allow them to get the best from foreign countries. For the students who come to India from abroad, the new system will let them get better perspectives on India. It will allow them to learn more about India, and will boost the image of India world-wide.

The new autonomy given to all colleges should help them build themselves in a way that better caters to some niches. The new focus on liberal arts and multidisciplinary colleges was made with the Ivy League colleges in mind. The aim is to build a similar group of very high quality institutions in India.

##A Brief Point on the Language System Under NEP

Many people were caught up on the language system. The NEP still encourages English. This is encouraged from the Foundation Stage (3-8 years of age). The only difference is that English is no longer the medium of instruction. However, under the new system, students are taught language in a new way. The NEP recommends following the style used by the ""Samskrita Bharati"", which is more functional, and generally better. So even ""third languages"" will be more emphasised and learned/taught better.

In addition, the reason mother tongue is being emphasised, is because a lot of students still don't feel comfortable in English, despite having studied in English medium schools. It simply doesn't help them to think in a language that they aren't comfortable in, and puts them at a disadvantage. Instead, in the bilingual system, they can learn and think in their mother tongue, while communicating in English.

The language used in HEIs is not mentioned, but it will presumably be the same. The only difference is for law students, where the local language will be taught. This is because lower courts use the local language over English, while higher courts use English.

https://i.redd.it/229oj54jdp231.png

### Highlights

* **Background:** The Delhi Government is beginning installations of about 1.4 lakh CCTV cameras putting the privacy and freedom of millions of Delhi residents at risk. Feeds from these will be made available to RWAs and Market Associations - without any safeguards!
* **Infringing privacy, threatening women's safety:** The CCTV Project is completely illegal. It has no underlying legal framework or any legal safeguards. Even the  bidding has been carried out in a secretive manner and our RTI for more information on it was deftly dodged by the Government.
* **We put the Delhi Government to notice:** Today we sent a legal notice after repeatedly bringing public attention to this issue through social media. In the instance the project continues, we will examine and undertake all steps available under law to fight and defend every person's privacy!

The Delhi Government was for years, stuck in a battle with the Lieutenant Governor to install and fulfil its promise of about 1.4 lakh CCTV cameras in Delhi at the cost of 500 crore. The LG’s office had recommended the cameras be installed with the permission of the police, and drafted [**rules**](http://dceast.delhigovt.nic.in/wps/wcm/connect/b4db69004622dcdbb778b7c8da9eb17e/CCTV.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&amp;lmod=1855201116&amp;CACHEID=b4db69004622dcdbb778b7c8da9eb17e) governing the use of CCTVs in Delhi.

Disregarding this, on June 3, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced installation of the cameras would finally begin by June 8. This is a project which will infringe the fundamental right to privacy, is a waste of public money and worse, even can contribute to endangering women's safety. Today we were constrained to send them a legal notice to halt the project immediately. Read on for more details.

### A secretive process

For a project costing more than 500 crores and impacting the privacy of millions living and visiting Delhi, there have been no open public consultations inviting comments and suggestions on the rules governing such cameras. There has also been no cost-benefit analysis, and the entire tendering process was done without the bid documents and the scope of work being made publicly accessible.

For instance details of the project were also not provided through our RTI request and the Delhi Government incorrectly claimed that such details were already available in the public domain, when in fact, they were not (*read the* [***RTI request***](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jwWPi8gApRwwmiB3mmnSqNndqVvajK0E/view?usp=sharing) *and the* [***reply here***](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l0k0J2i2kJM9f7M2EHvu7aGTmfndvMtI/view?usp=sharing)*).* For the record the complete details were not made available on the PWD website and even the Standard Operating Procedure for thier installation and operation has not been published in a proper manner.

### Assualt on privacy

Hard fought battles of getting and implementing privacy as a fundamental right are now at risk in Delhi, where lakhs of CCTVs will now record each and every movement of citizens. According to one [**survey**](http://www.iosrjournals.org/iosr-jhss/papers/Vol.%2023%20Issue12/Version-2/B2312020408.pdf) conducted on this issue, 210 out of 250 or 84% of the respondent students were concerned about the CCTV footage being used for stalking and personal abuse.

As per the Supreme Court’s decision in the right to privacy case (*Justice K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India, (2017) 10 SCC 1*), the three core elements to gauge the legality of a privacy violation are, (a) legality; (b) legitimate state aim; and (c) proportionality. The CCTV project fails on all these three parameters. Also, for questioning Peters and doubting Thomases, several passages in the right to privacy judgement clearly hold that even information in public spaces has a privacy right attached to them.

### A voyuers dream, a stalkers paradise

A one-page note providing the Standard Operating Procedure for such cameras makes the Resident Welfare Association nominee one of the primary custodians of the footage recorded. In the absence of any safeguards, this means that your local neighbourhood committee member can access and use any recordings collected from any cameras within the neighbourhood.

It can also lead to higher crime against women and issues of moral policing given that such unhindered, unregulated and liberal access to CCTV feeds will be provided to a unrestricted number of people. This will be done without any safeguards. When we say, ""without any"", we mean **absolutely zero**.

### Putting the Delhi Government to Notice

All of these points are set out at length in a legal notice we sent today to the Hon’ble Chief Minister of Delhi ([**Read the notice here**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tW6CsHuIWQN7K-MLgjmlij8o-T-rSRgf/view?usp=sharing)) demanding for a halt to such installations, opening up the proposal for public consultations and the addition of adequate safeguards to protect the privacy and freedom of millions of Delhi residents. Today, we remind the Government that Orwell's 1984 is work of fiction and caution, not an instruction manual.

We would like to thank Kritika Bhardwaj, Advocate, for her legal advice on this matter.

1559846293,bikbar,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bxk9j6/nep_and_the_language_problem_what_should_be_the/,0,1,,,NEP and the language problem - what should be the 3rd language?,"We all know that there is a big controversy going on regarding the 3rd language teaching in schools proposed by National Educational Policy 2019. The proposal of teaching 3 mandatory languages - local, English and Hindi was bitterly opposed especially by politicians from the south. Centre has decided to scrap the Hindi imposition part.

So, what should be the 3rd language suitable for all the states of India? I have an idea, like that: -

We have 22 scheduled languages. 21of these (excluding Sanskrit) can be grouped in 6 categories:

1) Himalayan: Dogri, Kashmiri, Nepali

2) Northern: Hindi, Punjabi, Urdu, Maithili

3) Western: Gujarati, Marathi, Konkani, Sindhi

4) Eastern: Assamese, Bengali, Odiya

5) Southern: Tamil, Telegu, Kanada, Malayalam

6) Tribal: Santali, Meitei, Bodo

We shouldn't give priority to any special language like Hindi. So, what could be done? 

Let each state pick 1 language from each group as the 3rd language. So, each state would have 6 languages to teach.

Let the students pick a 3rd language from 3 choices at the upper primary level (class 6-7-8), and a different one from another three at the secondary level (class 9-10-11-12).

Let me give an example:

Suppose, WB has chosen 6 languages: Nep, Hnd, Mar, Ody, Tam, and Sant.

Now, a student of a state school will have to choose a 3rd language for Up-Pri stage among a group of 3 languages like Nep, Hnd, Mar. For the sec section she will have to choose one from the 2 nd group consisting Ody, Tam and Sant.

In that way, it would be possible to provide adequate infrastructure and teachers for the 3rd language teaching in most school clusters.

Promotion of Languages:

Each state would be encouraged to promote their own languages in other states by means of providing teaching experts, scholarships etc.

Pros:

I think that method would promote ""Unity in Diversity"".

It would strengthen our national integrity by reducing the language barrier.

It would also help the students to seek jobs in other states.

Con:

It would be difficult to teach so many languages.

1559849896,pbshiva,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bxkzkr/my_thoughts_on_three_language_education_policy/,1,0,,,My thoughts on Three language education policy proposal,"I just realized that three language education policy even if not enforcing Hindi, will end up enabling and propagating only Hindi! Since I'm from Tamilnadu, I'll restrict my views to it; but you can pick this template and apply to any state/UT of India.

Students cannot learn on their own, this would mean hiring new teachers. But Schools cannot afford to hire many teachers due to budget, that cascades to lean number of choices available for student. German/French/Japan or any such international language teachers will be highly sought after by lavish private schools which translates to high salary for them, naturally schools catering to middle class will not be able to afford them.

Thus school administration will end up hiring Hindi teachers readily available from Dhakshina Bharat Hindi Prachar Sabha. Maybe some schools present in borders towns like Vellor, Hosur, Nagapattinam will choose Telugu, Kannadam, Malayalam and so on. Baring them I can only see Hindi flourishing in future.

I'm not sure if this is correct, but I feel uneasy to know my tax money is going to be used to make people learn Hindi, while my language is not going to get any due recognition. Honestly no one wants to learn new language, unless there is need! what am I gonna do learning Bengali or Punjabi, no offence intended it's plain truth.",bxkzkr,,false,/r/india/comments/bxkzkr/my_thoughts_on_three_language_education_policy/,Policy/Economy

With small farm holdings, less that 10 acres, it becomes impractical to use heavy farm machinery. As of now, farmers are facing a shortage of labourers due to various reasons. Primarily that rural youth do not want to work in farms anymore. They would rather stay unemployed rather than work in fields. And I do not blame them for this. Otherwise they would rather come to cities and work on jobs like security guards etc. Due to this there is an acute shortage of farm labourers. I am speaking of this from personal experience of having a farm in vidarbha, guess the situation will not be very different in other parts.

This has led to cartelisation of workers, with their ""managers"" dictating the prices and availability to the farmers. Earlier, many farmers relied on help of other farmers families to get things done. But now with diversification and mass migrations, this is no longer possible. 

A minimum income scheme will make the little available manual workforce ever scarce and expensive. Why would people toil in the fields and farms when they will get approximately the same money by sitting at home? And this will certainly spell doom for small scale farmers who are dependent on manual labour for almost all of their needs.",c5nh2m,,false,/r/india/comments/c5nh2m/a_scheme_like_nyay_would_create_utter_chaos_in/,Policy/Economy

With a few months to go for assembly elections, this move by AAP seems more of desperate measure to rope in all the women voters.

Considering 25% percent of the riders to be women, the finances absolutely do not work out. There are already glaring issues regarding the safety of women and providing freebies is definitely not the way to go about it.

I have attached the annual report of DMRC which clearly shows that it is eventually finding its way to profitability. Making metro commute free for women will be a hugely regressive step in the existing scheme of things.

This proposal will not only fuck the DMRC finances but also the increase in footfall will be catastrophic for the management and also for the fellow commuters who are *paying* for the metro rides. I am an average randian and it took me a few minutes to predict the possibility of this glaring repercussion. Imagine the issues that will be discovered if this step is analyzed thoroughly.

This session of Parliament welcomes with open arms certain laws we've been quite concerned about. This includes, amendments to the Aadhaar Act; the Draft Personal Data Protection Bill, 2018. This timeline coincides with the proposed amendments to the draft Information Technology (Intermediaries Guidelines) Rules, 2018.

All this may seem like dull, legal mumbo-jumbo (*which it often is*); however these legal changes and proposals has a real, direct and severe impact on your privacy. When we launched the #SaveOurPrivacy campaign we made a public commitment to you, to keep fighting to ensure it is protected and over the past few months we have kept busy serving it!

Here's a few highlights to catch up with what we've been stirring:

**1. Public Engagement and informing analysis**: We have continuously engaged not only through our submissions to public consultations but through our posts that summarise these issues with explainers.

* Aadhaar Amendment: We have been coordinating with our friends over at the, ""Rethink Aadhaar"" campaign. This includes spending time in devising strategy, lending resources, collaboration to increase visibility.
* Intermediaries Rules: Some proposed changes to these rulesvwill restrict not only your freedom of speech and expression but by measures such as breaking encryption, endanger your right to privacy ([Read about it here](https://internetfreedom.in/we-urge-meity-to-press-reboot-on-the-intermediary-rules-saveourprivacy-righttomeme/)).
* The Draft Personal Data Protection Bill: This proposed law may be introduced in the present session of parliament. It contains various gaps that need addressing before it is turned into legislation ranging from a number of exceptions provided to the Government to the lack of provisions that deal with surveillance reform and protection of children online ([Read about it here](https://internetfreedom.in/saveourprivacy-initial-statement-on-justice-srikrishna-committee-report/)).

**2. Redrafting the Indian Privacy Code**: This has been a hell of a lot of work! SaveOurPrivacy's model code on privacy has undergone the process of a complete redraft. To ensure we do this well, we held a a roundtable with some of the best legal counsels and academics to ensure the code is equipped to address further issues of data protection, privacy and surveillance. We will be releasing this version publicly by the end of this week with an explainer.",c4klej,,false,/r/india/comments/c4klej/and_we_cant_stop_and_we_wont_stop_saveourprivacy/,Policy/Economy

&amp;#x200B;

Today, India’s next round of challenges soon begin. Winners, losers aside, the fundamental remain, the people and their rights.

Considering our world's ever evolving technologies, a large portion of those rights are beginning to glitch between the physical and digital sphere. Expecting the representatives of the people ensure they step it up a notch to be inclusive of these developments, cannot be too much of an ask. Prior to the general elections, for this exact reason, we set out certain demands out of the political manifestos of our parties ([**Read our Digital Rights Agenda here**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AX57cteUOqWmUsh6eeaPqAcLo8KKMx673-drxE1lzfk/edit)). It essentially advocates for the protection of fundamental rights within the digital sphere.

With this in mind we have written to the Government to make your digital a governance priority ([**Read here for more**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i8Ta1muh0oJ7WfAdB-Qbjhsgni2nbW4A/view?usp=sharing)). We provide a brief of what the 6 point Digital Rights Agenda intends to cover and changes it aims to bring about. As the Agenda is largely all-encompassing of digital rights issues, we suggested that the Ministry considering including it in the 100 day agenda required by the Prime Minister from various departments and ministries.

While there are aspects that political parties may have advocated for through their manifestos, they have a long way to go before they produce results. We continue to urge the Government to strengthen the digital rights system in India upholding liberty and openness in line with the essential values of the Indian constitution. In order to achieve this, IFF will engage in all modes possible including executive bodies, legislatures as well as approaching courts and just as importantly, appeal to the members of the public.

1559642679,chuttadrockstar,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bwmz0o/a_criticism_of_the_new_education_policy_2019_and/,6,9,,,A criticism of the New Education Policy 2019 and existent education policies,"**Problems with respect to HECI and fee fixation :**  One of the biggest problems that the policy has done, is that it has legitimized the policy of state exit and buttressed the belief of Private Education providing Quality education. **HEFA, as has been founded by GoI in association with Canara Bank and has  a corpus of 1 lakh crore of which centre is paying only 8500 crores, puts this whole thing into perspective. The rest of the corpus is to be attained via loans, which has to be repaid by institutes over period of time. Now, indirectly asking, on whom will the institutes push over this liability of 90,000 crores? Its the students, and the pricing of courses**. While Fee fixation and allowing autonomy is welcome to an extent, but let us not fool ourselves, any HEI with half decent infra would need a fuckton of expenditure and the money has to be absorbed from the peoples pockets

&amp;#x200B;

**A blueprint towards privatisation of Higher education.** Not a word has been spoken about Quality Assurance or the fact of Accountability fixation towards Private institutes. ASSOCHAM reports that 93% of the MBAs in our country is unemployable. ( [https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/featurephilia/story/mba-education-problems-328626-2016-07-11](https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/featurephilia/story/mba-education-problems-328626-2016-07-11) ) Now lets get into this quandary. We want to privatise education without a semblance of accountability towards them really providing people quality skill upgradation. Let us look into the average unemployability, the Private college Engineer stands much worse in employability situation than the average NIT/JU/BESU (and am not even taking the better NITs and IITs and IIScs into picture). **THE WHOLE DOCUMENT PROMISES US LAVISH WORDS, MUCH PROMOTION, BUT IT SPEAKS ZILCH ABOUT WHERE THE FUNDS ARE GOING TO BE RAISED FROM. In the previous year we had seen how the INSTITUTE OF EMINENCE tag was given to JIO institute. This meant that they could raise a massive 1000 crores for over 10 years , but we all know the project never even begun, how can we judge its credibility and potential. The government did away 1000 crore clause for private institutes temporarily, but there has not been any subsequent clarification on it, thus proving  the** ***crony- corporate- neta - babudom clout*** **is taking over the education system too.**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**The Report clearly shows that round about 49% of the children who take up education in Class 1 do not continue it beyond Class 10.**  The policy sort of considers that  this ratio will be maintained, and we should actually place infrastructure in such a fashion that it caters and provides quality care for the 51%. Implicitly it has recognized that the rest of the 49% will not come up, and that there would be more stress towards the 51% who continue than bringing up the 49% who are exiting the net.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Fails to address the biggest issue : EMPLOYABILITY .** Take this in two parts\*\*.\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

**Employability of the lesser skilled :** THE Present Government **SINCE 2015** has been pushing the skilling agenda. Furthermore as has been the priorities of the policy, skilling has been mandated as an important part of the DEP,2019.   It had promoted the PPP model for skilling. But the model as Sharda Prasad report has shown has failed to muster much influence. So much so that 99.5% of the skilling units are government owned. The skilling institutes are marred with **CONFLICT OF INTEREST,** Malgovernance and the credibility of their skilling quality is pretty poor, once we look into the rates of employability after completing the courses. The NSQF framework has adopted a technique of **recognition to prior learning** \- but although the skill of a layman is getting recognized, what is its effective use, if it doesnt lead to any jobs? In the above tone lets also take up the **ISSUE OF SYLLABI in VT and diploma courses. The course structure in VT is haphazard enough with its whole bouquet of courses, preventing streamlining. This means aligning the courses to international requirements, ensuring a basic foundation in the 3Rs, and life-long learning**. It implies national standards for an in-demand skill set with national/global mobility that translates into better jobs. Short duration courses (with no real skills) that provide low pay for suboptimal jobs cannot be called national standards. Hence the current national standards have to drastically improve.   Germany has only 340 courses — in accordance with the National Classification of Occupations 2015 (which itself was based on the International Standard Classification of Occupations). Such trainees will be a national asset. **What we have instead are nearly 10,000 standards, produced mostly by consultants.** There cannot be thousands of standards (compressed into 2,000 qualification packs/job roles), and “delivered” to trainees in a matter of a few months. **This is not what the National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF) had recommended. The focus should be in strengthening reading, writing and arithmetic skills.** No skill development can succeed if most of the workforce lacks the foundation to pick up skills in a fast-changing world. Vocational training must by definition be for a minimum of a year, which includes internship (without which certification is not possible). **Short-term training should be confined to recognising prior learning of informally trained workers who are already working.**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Employability of the higher skilled :** The problem of the higher skilled is sufficiently different from that of the lower skilled. Such a situation has happened due to few reasons :

1. promoting a flawed pattern of **EDUCATION FOR JOBS and MARKS**
2. Lack of requisite jobs in the sectors of choice. **Yojana in 2017 had carried out an Important little study where it matched the aspirations of students of HEI to the jobs that were prevalant across the state.** The results were near abysmal, given only few states had above 40% correlation between the jobs they were producing and the jobs that the students were demanding.
3. **Putting in a process of ""Hands On"" education and not  ""Hands free"" education.** While the government has been pushing its cause of making innovation an important part for Ranking HEIs and ranking technical institutes,and brought in a plethora of schemes to Encourage partnerships with such colleges that have a ranking of less than 200 as per QS,  the problems involving the lack of **""Hands On""** education are far more complicated than just that. It involves the problem of RoI on such innovation (credits system), the push towards Quantitative numbers (yes, more the number of papers, and not more the number of papers in journals having high impact factor), the lack of imaginativeness in our educational regime across society, all contributes to the same.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Romanticizing of Sanskrit and the past. Case in point, Bharatiya Shiksha Board.** No, we arent going to become a vishwaguru by promoting cow pee as a cancer cure. No, Bharatiya and vedic shiksha boards can never be equal to CISCE and CBSE. The skill imparted for doing astrology can only get a person to some VHP shakha, sorry it is never going to a man a job to earn a living. Promoting pseudo science in the name of TRADITION is blasphemy.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Mission Nalanda and Mission Taxila has said that there will be Higher Univ in every district,**  but there is no plan in place. The government trying to establish the fact that pushing private people to open and run univs can be good, but that will never be inclusive. **To remember all those who believe this is some new innovative plan of mudiji, the RUSA scheme and its intentions of opening HEIs across all EDUCATIONALLY BACKWARD districts was present since UPA days. The present re-wrapping and calling for the Private sector gives me only a feeling of Skill India 2.0**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**ASER AND NAS reports clearly show the abysmal state of education in our primary levels. There has not been one attempt made to fix the situation,** rather than a vague policy prescription of INTERACTIVE EDUCATION. **Mid day meal and good nutrition might attract and increase the GER at entry level,** but it isnt going to solve the **LEARNING POVERTY GAP ISSUES .** Let us not fool ourselves, a country where the average class 5 to class 8 going child struggles to solve class 2 mathematics, skilling is an useless exercise. OECDs PISA report had ranked us abysmally, so much so that we withdrew participation from PISA and joined it back only this year. Economic Survey 2017 part 1 shows that the learning gap is far greater in girls wrt mathematics. In such a case solutions can be manifold. **Should we create a separate situation for girls, where they feel confident enough to take part in maths and science related activities? Studies have shown that given the Backward Upbringing that a female child often gets, combined with the fact that there is a huge Number of UNWANTED FEMALES ( Computed by metric Sex ratio of Last child) it is only expected that they would feel Underconfident than their fellow male compatriot who has better ACCESS to CARE, NUTRITION at home. The worst part of the report has been, although it has agreed time and over again about the learning poverty gap, it has ONLY PROMOTED SOME COSMETIC MEASURES LIKE FLIPPED LEARNING AND DIGITAL BOARDS.**

&amp;#x200B;

**BRINGING UNIVS UNDER CIVIL SERVICE CONDUCT RULES.** One of the most important places of societal evolution and innovation and invention is the University. The varsity must be kept a free place, where infusion of ideas, permeability and penetration of ideas must be maximum. On the other hand, our government has left no stone unturned to bring the Univs under the ambit of CCS rules. Vide CCS rules ; A professor would not be able to openly criticize and elaborately express his dissent against a government policy in an editorial without having its approval. The problem is not just in bringing Univs under CCS, but a concealed attempt at making SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY and PROGRESS subservient to some whimsical stuff written in Ancient Textbooks. The Indian Science Congress was just a blatant attempt to push its agenda. Such vile attempts are being concealed under norms of **""PROMOTING RESEARCH IN CHOICE SECTORS"" , "" GRANTS FORWARDED TO SUCH RESEARCH THAT IS SOCIALLY VIABLE**""  and such other ambiguous terminology. (Vide schemes like IMPRESS, IMPRINT etc)

&amp;#x200B;

**BRAIN DRAIN AND BRAIN USE .**  A wonderful opportunity lay right infront of our hands to reverse back atleast a section of brain that has been drained. Given the rise of RIGHT in USA and across many European nations, we could actually reverse and bring some of our talented brains back to our country. But for that we need a liberated education system, and a system that is ready to suitably employ such people with due remuneration. Also lets move into the issue of **BRAIN USE.** A very important issue here can be one of **social learning based methods, via ""Interested people"". Can we tap such brains, that are probably voluntarily unemployed, or maybe want a more respectable employment, and try to push them in sectors where they can impart learning to say a TRIBAL school, or maybe the average SSA school, with a honorary compensation**? We have always been crying ""HEY NO TEACHERS AND NO RESOURCE"" while we actually have resources that we arent ready to look into.

**ARE WE TRYING TO BE A GLOBAL LABOUR ECONOMY OR A GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY? The whole policy has been mired with ambiguities, where it speaks of IMPROVED ACCESS, but no QUALITY IMPROVEMENT, where it speaks of ACCESS IMPROVEMENT, but doesnt really proceed to describe how it would finance, and in places where it speaks of FINANCING of HEIs it seems to forgot the margins of difference that exist between a PSU and a Govt funded HEI. Private, for profit  education has never been linked to improved access in areas of low access. What seems further is the deceit by the govt to concede an explicit percentage of society as going to be ""leftovers, since they wont continue education anyways"" , and the deceit by the govt to EXIT in a sustained manner from a section that needed greater govt involvement in the veener of ""PRIVATE EMPOWERMENT"". The push for higher fees with minimal ""restraint"" will only lead to severe EXCLUSION of the lower rungs of the MIDDLE CLASS from the advantages of HEI while buttressing the hold of the upper echelons of the 1% both ""Sociologically and systematically"".**

A total hypocrisy where we speak of inclusive education yet, we believe FOR PROFIT education will push education to the EDUCATIONALLY BACKWARD PLACES. The Vacancies in the biggest and best Institutes wrt FACULTY are being kept vacant intentionally, to show them in poor light, to the public, enabling generous privatization. Rather than being lost in dreams of how digital blackboards and play based education and a 5+3+3+4 education , which are cosmetic reforms to the real problems of POVERTY (in learning) , UNEMPLOYMENT and DEPLORABLE INFRASTRUCTURE.

https://i.redd.it/d07k09qtkv631.jpg

### Highlights

* **Background:** Two writ petitions were filed in the Madras High Court in July 2018 praying for the interlinking of Aadhaar with social media for identity authentication purposes. We were deeply concerned with this development and decided to intervene.
* **Intervention time:** Given the relevance of these cases, IFF goes to Court for the 6th time, continuing its fight for the right to privacy of the citizens of  India, amongst various other concerns. Our stand in court is to protect user privacy, prevent surveillance but also to address the harms and regulatory issues such as end-to-end encryption which are of concern to the Hon'ble Court. Rest assured, all our submissions are to advance digital rights and the constitutional values!

### / Why we decided to intervene.

Information is necessary for a well functioning society. However, it also carries power and creates social structures. For instance social media while making sure all of us remain connected is no longer merely a way to stay in touch. It has become a way of life and permits a wider functionality. This also carries risks and harms. Many social media platforms today are rife with abuse, misinformation and illegal content. It is undermining the demos of Indian democracy. A solution which has been posed in the Madras High Court is linking the real world identities (government ID's such as Aadhaar) with social media accounts.

Concerned by these developments, in early June, 2019, we filed two interventions in *Antony Clement Rubin v. Union of India &amp; Ors* (W.P. No. 20774/2018) and *Janani Krishnamurthy v. Union of India* (W.P. No. 20214/2018). This is in our continuing work in approaching and assisting courts all over India in matters related to technology and fundamental rights. In the hearing today, our intervention application was accepted by the Hon'ble High Court of Madras. We thank our counsels Arun Karthik Mohan and Suhrith Parthasarathy for their representation.

### // Why linking Aadhaar to social media is terrible.

Aadhaar being linked with our social media accounts? Here's why we think this would result in a terrible outcome.

* **Increased power of social media companies over users:** It would undermine the right to privacy in several ways. At present we can only visualise a few, and as we very well know with technology based policy interventions, the outcomes are often much worse and the threats only multiple when user rights are not considered at the outset. For instance, it would allow social media companies to gather deeper, more granular information about their users. A government ID, especially one such as Aadhaar which has a common identifier would permit them to link the personal data on the social media platform more easily. This would result in more pervasive dossiers of social media users available to the highest bidder who can serve us then with ads across platforms. Not to mention it would also increase the harms to speech by chilling dissenting voices.
* **Troubling legality:** This also becomes troubling neatly on the legality of the proposal. As per us, the private use of Aadhaar remains problematic as indicated by the Hon'ble Supreme Court. This becomes incredibly dangerous when it is mandatorily linked to our social media accounts. All this is happening while we are still governed by deficient safeguards, that were devised for telephone tapping applied to digital surveillance by the government. In a related matter to reform the safeguards for government surveillance (which is at present occurring without any judicial oversight) we have made a constitutional challenge through a petition in the Supreme Court of India by filing *Internet Freedom Foundation v. Union of India* (W.P. (C). No. 44/2019) \[Soon coming up for hearing on July 2, 2019\].
* **Increased risk to minors and women:** Linking real world identities may counter intuitively also contribute to the spreading of misinformation, abuse and threats which not only result in a direct attack against our democracy but also allows for individualised harms which more often come through to women and children. Women (other persons as well, especially individuals from vulnerable groups) in India quite often have adopted pseudonyms on social media to avoid censure from family, acquaintances or wider social judgement. Linking their Aadhaar to their social media accounts would tremendously increase informational risks even rising to the level of threats to their physical security.

### /// A short statement on today's developments

IFF's executive director, Apar Gupta stated that, ""*We are grateful to the Hon'ble Madras High Court for permitting us to make submissions given the vexed issues of Aadhaar and social media linking. This was possible due to the submissions of our counsel Suhrith Parthasarthy who is advising and representing us in this case. He also indicated the larger issues before the court on which we plan to engage in future hearings. Given the pervasive use of social media in our lives and the existing tools to harvest and utilise data for marketing purposes, not to mention, individualised advertisements, the entire gathering of personal data itself has been a constant cause for concern in the law few years. Adding Aadhaar to this cocktail for the purpose of verification of identity would arguably create further harm. This case also concerns issues of online abuse, misinformation which can contribute to challenges to social order and when law enforcement is deficient, even violence. Hence, the Hon'ble Court has also in recent hearings been considering issues of intermediary liability and end-to-end encryption. On all these issues, IFF's staff will work with care to ensure submissions are made to safeguard and protect the digital rights of every social media user in India.*""

In continuance with IFF's mission -- we will keep approaching courts in a systematic and planned manner to ensure the protection of the fundamental rights of every India.

Transparency is a hallmark in all of IFF's work. Hence, as with all our filed case pleadings even a copy of the intervention application is made public and is available in the link below. The next date for hearing in this case is July 26, 2019.

1560261336,stranger-than-you,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bzcskn/beware_online_money_fraud_using_google_pay_please/,42,127,,,BEWARE: Online money fraud using Google Pay (please help spread awareness),"First off: YOU CAN REQUEST MONEY FROM OTHER USING GOOGLE PAY. This is something new compared to the other traditional payment and money transfer services. 

What happened:
I had put up a sell ad on olx for a cycle. Got a call by a person impersonating to be an army personnel saying his child really liked the cycle and he wanted it. He was posted away but would pay right away and the family would pick it up later. 

He insisted paying through google pay. On sharing the QR Code, he proceeded to *request* a large sum. When I called him out, he gave me non sense saying that it’s google showing me his account balance and I just had to accept. (I’ve been an active user of GPay so could figure what happened). He was on call during this pressuring from the other end. I declined and requested the money; he hung up and blocked me everywhere. 



When I posted about this to Instagram today to help create awareness, a friend’s friend had actually lost 10K in a similar manner in the same way. 

IMPORTANT:

1. People can request money from google pay.

2. You don’t have to “accept” to receive money. 

3. Beware of potential buyers with a sympathetic story (especially when it’s unasked for). 

4. If you do lose money this way, contact the cyber cell. Google pay uses UPI and each UPI ID is linked to a bank account. 

_________


Be careful when post ads on quikr/ olx / Sulekha. You’re contact is put out there.

If people insist they pay before they even try to understand what your product is, RED FLAG. 

Olx / quikr etc need to figure out better privacy settings. 

GooglePay- I don’t understand why’d you have a “request” feature on a payments app?!

EDIT: 
1.  If anyone knows how to get this to a wider audience, please let me know. There are so many who don’t know about the request money feature. 
2.  Can you help me report this to google?

Losing money in the share market is on me but indirectly it was because of the whole ILFS fiasco.*

I'll try to summarize this whole situation in short and simple before it gets too boring and how it affects all of us directly or indirectly. I will not even try to be technically correct because then I'll never finish typing this but I'll try explaining the important stuff in layman's terms.

**What is IL&amp;FS and why have I never heard of it before this whole thing?**

[From Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_Leasing_%26_Financial_Services) \-*""Infrastructure Leasing &amp; Financial Services Limited (IL&amp;FS) is an Indian infrastructure development and finance company.*

*It operates through more than 250 subsidiaries including IL &amp; FS Investment managers, IL &amp; FS financial services and IL &amp; FS Transportation networks India Limited (ITNL). Its projects include some of the largest infrastructure projects in India including India's longest tunnel, Chenani-Nashri Tunnel, which was opened for traffic in April 2017.""*

The reason you never heard about them before is because financing and participating in infrastructure projects all over the country is generally boring stuff and doesn't make the news. It's not like trying to reach Mars or launching the next big consumer tech product.

**Major Shareholders** \- Approx % (source: [Shareholder report 2018](https://www.ilfsindia.com/media/2383/ilfs-shareholding-pattern-as-on-march-31-2018.pdf))

1. LIC - 25%
2. Orix Corporation (Japan) - 24%
3. ILFS Employees Welfare Trust - 12%
4. Abu Dhabi Investment Authority - 13%
5. HDFC - 9%
6. Central Bank Of India - 8%
7. State Bank of India  - 6%

As you can see, big chunk of it is owned by LIC, employee trust and Indian Public and Private banks. Not to forget these are direct shareholders who will see fall in wealth because of lost value of ILFS and it's subsidiaries. Lenders to ILFS will lose a lot of money too.

&amp;#x200B;

**Major Lenders -**

[(source)](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/money-and-banking/banks-have-20000-cr-exposure-to-ilfs/article26282929.ece)

Multiple Public and Private sector banks are exposed to ILFS and are at risk of not recovering thousands of crores they've lended. These include Bank Of baroda, State Bank of India, Bank Of India from public sector and Yes Bank, Kotak Mahindra, Axis Bank, HDFC and IndusInd from Private sector.

&amp;#x200B;

**Liquidity crunch** \-

Liquidity crunch basically refers to inability to pay debt and debt interest because of lack of Cash and cash equivalents. ILFS group had overall Rs. 91,000 Crore+ of Debt in its books. But to service it, it does not have the liquidity. This it is not that ILFS is saying it has lost all money. They would lend the money for infra project to others which they would receive later on along with interest and some profit depending on the project as shown in the books but in reality these were close to turning bad debts which couldn't be recovered.  ILFS said they've got assets and receivables to cover the debt and debt interest but they are unable to realize them and make the payments. They defaulted on the payments multiples times.

Like you've given your friend a 20k loan which he used to buy an antique item which 'might' be worth 20k or more and he should be able to sell it to pay the loan back on the due date but he's got no cash at that time to pay the dues and he's finding it difficult to sell the antique item. He's kinda not broke but he's not able to make the payment. Not the best analogy but I think it does convey the point. It is a lot more complicated than above because of inter-company loans, defaults, asset-mismatch and cross-shareholding.

&amp;#x200B;

**Scam** \-

There isn't an exact amount for scam (or at least I couldn't find it with decent source and explanation) like you see flying in Nirav Modi or Mallya case. But in a forensic report by Court appointed Grant Thornton India (one of the big accounting services and consulting firms ranking after the BIG4), they've concluded saying the the Committee Of Directors made up of Co-founders, Managing directors, Chairman and other directors were aware and participant of mismanagement, misappropriations of company funds and fraud. It should be in thousands of crores of misappropriated funds though. ([source](https://www.moneylife.in/article/why-the-delay-in-action-when-gt-report-pins-responsibility-on-cabal-of-four-at-ilfs/56535.html))

So company borrowed money from the banks and other lenders and used it for purposes other than stated when borrowing, not following the industry and govt. rules for the benefit of company directors and third parties. Then in the end they were like "" sorry we can't pay back the debt haha its fucked up"".

&amp;#x200B;

**Incompetence of Public institutions** \-

SFIO ( The Serious Fraud Investigation Office ) has openly called out RBI for not taking action against ILFS on time.

[From Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/sfio-says-rbi-couldve-acted-faster-on-ilfs/articleshow/69626233.cms) \-*“Action  at the right time may have prevented ballooning of the matter,” the  SFIO said in its chargesheet on the IL&amp;FS matter. “It is observed  that RBI had repeatedly pointed out noncompliance with the group  exposure norms and wrong calculations of net owned funds (NOFs) in its  inspection reports for the year 2015 onwards.”No penalties were imposed during the period and subsidiary IFIN was  allowed to continue operations without any corrective measures, it said.  “It was only in November 2017  (that) the classification of group companies in order to arrive at NOF  and credit to risk assets ratio (CRAR) as per RBI Act was strongly  conveyed to IFIN,” said the chargesheet, seen by ET.*

*“RBI  should conduct an internal investigation as to the reason for the delay  and take appropriate action and also take suitable policy measures to  prevent such fraudulent action,” it said.*

LMAO so RBI could've taken all this seriously, performed their duties and maybe the situation wouldn't have been so bad. There is no sense of accountability and clear display of incompetence but an internal investigation should suffice I guess.

&amp;#x200B;

**Statutory Auditors** \-

First let's get a little background on auditing, auditing firms and their work.

Auditing services is dominated by the **Big 4 - EY, Deloitte, PWC and KPMG** around the globe and in India. These MNC companies offers everything from Auditing to consulting and advisory services for all industries, functions and sectors. These are huge companies with thousands of employees in 100s of countries. After the big4, comes Grant Thornton and BDO. They are big but not anywhere near the size and power of the BIG4. The BIG4 is like a oligopoly. Name any top Indian/MNC company and  high chance one of these 4 will be their auditors.

Deloitte and its member firms were the auditors of ILFS group company along with EY. Auditor is appointed by the shareholders and report to the shareholders. An auditors job in simple terms is to give their opinion on whether the financials statements made by the management show a true and fair view of the company. So when a company reports it had 20,000 thousand crores of revenue but 5,000 crores of net loss, it is the auditor's job to verify and give their opinion whether these figures given by the management are true or not. FYI, ILFS had 200+ subsidiaries and different subsidiaries can have different auditors. These are generally smaller but reputed Indian CA firms.

Now, the amount of work done by the auditors to give their opinion, the scope of audit, audit remunerations, cross-selling services etc can be topic of debates for some other time. But here it seems like Deloitte team had a good idea that ILFS was not operating like it should, the financial statements did not show the true position of the company, that they had serious corporate governance issues and they still provided a clean audit report for multiple years. This makes the Deloitte team a culprit in this mess. Also, just to add auditors are generally not changed by companies so frauds can do undetected for years. Deloitte had been auditing ILFS for around 10 years. EY was bought in as co-auditors only a year ago iirc. It was the auditor's job to report that cashflow issues were gonna pop up sooner than later but they failed at reporting this.

&amp;#x200B;

**A Joke that caught my eye** \- **'Evergreening of Loans'**

[(source)](https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/il-fs-case-deloitte-turned-a-blind-eye-to-ifin-s-evergreening-of-loans-for-10-years-finds-probe-1559968561218.html)

One of the ways the ILFS management cooked its books with Deloitte is referred as 'Evergreening of Loans'. It sounds so stupid but turns out it was very effective lol.

Basically when ILFS financed a project by lending, they would have to show it in the books as amount receivable at a later date (asset). They would continue to lend money for projects where they knew they'll never recover the money (for personal benefits maybe) and when the time of recovering money came and the other party couldn't pay back the amount, ILFS would have one of their own subsidiary companies fund the defaulting party who would then in return pay the original ILFS lender company. This way they never had to show these loans as NPA (non performing assets) in the books which would've had a negative effect on its profits and led to shareholders question the management policy of lending money to defaulting companies. Deloitte engagement team knew about this according to the emails in the linked source above but failed to act.

Simple yet effective trick.

&amp;#x200B;

**How all of this affects you** \-

It all leads to loss of investor's and taxpayers money. It was the taxpayers money that the government uses to fund government banks which gives loans to shitty companies who never pay it back and the banks record it as NPA.  If you directly held shares in any of the public/private sector banks, they would've reported a loss on these lendings to ILFS leading to drop in their profits and their share prices. If you held shares in ILFS group companies directly, you were fucked.

If you invested in Mutual funds who bought the bonds and securities of ILFS which they defaulted on, you've lost money. If your mutual held stakes in ILFS or any of the banks which lended money to ILFS, you've lost money. Check your mutual funds to see their exposure to IFLS group companies.

If you invested in other NBFC companies like I did in DHFL, they've been under lot of pressure and scrutiny. Raising new money has become more difficult to service their debts and I feel DHFL is going to die a slow death like Jet airways. I hope it doesn't.

Thousands of people will lose their jobs in projects funded by ILFS, in ILFS group companies and in companies directly affected by ILFS crisis (banks, lenders etc).

If only the company management had done their job ethically or had the auditors pointed this all out on time or had the authorities been a little more vigilant, maybe all of this would've ended in a different way.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;For UPI transaction done from ICICI Bank iMobile app,the maximum limit is Rs 1 lakh. A maximum of 20 transactions can be initiated in 24 hours from the first transaction.  
&gt;  
&gt;For UPI transaction done from NON ICICI Bank UPI App, the maximum limit is Rs 10,000 in 24 hours. The limit will be calculated from the first transaction done.

&gt;Note:For UPI transaction done from Google pay,the maximum limit is Rs 25,000 in 24 hours.  
&gt;  
&gt;This may change from time to time and is subject to the UPI guidelines.

I want to understand which guidelines allow ICICI to discriminate on the basis of app? I can understand the security reasons but 10k is low. Other banks don't discriminate third party apps like this.

I'm attaching the screenshots of the convo. When i asked how could it be possible  that the amount would would be so high with a single can of coke they sent me a screenshot of the bill breakdown where a 119 rupees COKE CAN was added. I was like HOW THE FUCK IS IT POSSIBLE that a coke can is 119 bucks? Like FR use your brain. Their i sent them multiple screenshots creating another order and showing them if i ADD A SINGLE CAN OF COKE the amount won't be 198 but 119 rupees.  To which they said they'll send me a 50bucks coupon for missing item. It had already been half hour since i started arguing and the burger was cold already like WTF WILL I DO WITH 50 RUPEES COUPON? I'm not ever using this shit service again.

I'm new to the Business world and have no prior experience in this field. I'm looking to start a Milkshake Kiosk Business in our home state. We identified our location and analyzed all parameters for maximum sales. We have the Investment capital with us.  But we can't be physically present at the Kiosk at all times.

Kindly suggest and advice me on What Business systems and practices should I establish in order to run the small business successfully without needing to be physically present. Thank you!!

Edit: Please take into consideration that there's very high demand for Milkshakes/smoothies/juices in the city we're trying to setup the business. 

The location we chose is an awesome place where there are 2 schools and a University and also high urban population. There exists no competition for this sector right now in that location, so we'll be the first to setup a Milkshake/Smoothie Kiosk.",c4jqfu,,false,/r/india/comments/c4jqfu/restauranteurs_and_small_business_owners_of/,Business/Finance

Blockchain, Cryptocurrencies, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Renewable Energy, Internet of Things, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, Self-Driving and Electric Vehicles and who knows what else.....  

&amp;#x200B;

The CEOs of today have to be able to see the future, build for it and lead it. That's no easy task, and given the uncertainty of leadership and dearth of skills, it comes as no surprise that \~75% of Indian CXO's aren't future ready.

1559911469,FuckinBoringUsername,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bxu6ax/i_need_help_understanding_the_concept_of_credit/,6,20,,,I need help understanding the concept of credit cards and Credit score,"Hi Randians, 

I posted this same question in r/personalfinance but thought posting here would be more beneficial cuz I'm Indian as well and you guys(and gals) can tell me finer details about credit card situation in India.

_TL;DR_ = Traded in cash/debit card entire life. Would like to know the benefits/downfalls of a credit card. Also what is Credit score and brief me everything about it.

Backstory: So I turned 18 last month and will be off to college in about a month. I don't have a job and my parents will provide me with my allowances.
I won't have any education loans
So now it's time to open my bank account (yay).

Now the dilemma. Neither me, nor my parents know much about credit cards as they're used debit card/cash/UPI their entire life and didn't pay heed towards credit cards.

Now I'm wondering should I get credit card in my name or not? 
I'll get money from my parents whenever I'll need(till I don't get a job after graduation) so I was leaning towards debit cards only
But someone told me that I would not be able to build credit score w/o credit cards

Also what is credit score and why is it important for me?

While there is little you can do, I suggest if you are using Hotstar (specially paid service) 

1. Change the password, but please do not change it to something you are already using somewhere else.
2. Check you email on  [https://haveibeenpwned.com/](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) , better still set email alerts to let you know if you are exposed.
3. Use password managers like Lastpass,  Bitwarden ,  Dashlane  , firefox.lockwise etc.

One news item that makes the round every few months is about Indian government's grand plans to make Indian roads fully-electric.

Read these news stories and you can't help but imagine that in a decade, Indian roads will be utopias where Teslas and Mahindra E2Os will glide silently pass you on their way to a solar powered recharging station.

Some samples:

* [India plans to have seven million EVs by 2020](https://mercomindia.com/india-plans-deploy-seven-million-electric-vehicles-2020/)

* [India to sell only EVs by 2030](https://www.timesnownews.com/business-economy/industry/article/only-electric-vehicles-to-be-sold-after-2030-in-india-niti-aayog/438731)

* [Only electric two-wheelers to be sold in India by 2025](https://www.news18.com/news/auto/bjp-led-nda-government-mulling-to-sell-only-electric-2w-3w-in-india-2023-onwards-2171395.html)


Is the government just memeing? As everyone knows, India has no viable EVs in the market. The only electric four-wheeler is the aforementioned E2O (which Mahindra discontinued). All the other EVs on the market are either e-rickshaws or shitty Chinese scootys.

To add to that, there is no charger network. None whatsoever.

Against the target of 70,00,000 EVs by 2020, India has met just 1/10th of that by 2019. Worse, the number of four-wheeled EVs sold in 2019 was a mind-boggling 3,600. [source](https://www.autocarindia.com/car-news/ev-sales-in-india-cross-75-lakh-mark-in-fy2019-412542)

China has shown that with concentrated action, you can do a lot to promote EVs. The country promoted EVs aggressively in 2009 and within a decade, has the world's largest EV market.

Moreover, within a decade, nearly 6% of passenger cars in China are electric.

Meanwhile, India is poised to reach the 5% EV penetration target...in 2030 [source](https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/indian-car-scene/210483-kotak-merely-5-indian-cars-will-electric-2030-a-3.html)

How on earth does India plan to achieve its lofty EV goals? Given the precarious nature of our environment and the horrible air quality in our metros, shouldn't promoting EVs be a priority? 

Yet all I keep reading are meme-tier news stories with nothing in the way of concrete subsidies for EV and charging network manufacturers.",c6kgwi,,false,/r/india/comments/c6kgwi/is_indian_government_just_memeing_about_electric/,Science/Technology

It is hereby suggested, ISRO our prestigious space exploration to ponder over these glorious thoughts:

1. Increase payload of Chandrayan to few kilotonnes and use this capability to throw garbage in outer space.

2. If possible throw this garbage in such a way that it forms a protective belt around tropical regions so that it blocks harmful UV/IR/VISIBLE radiation that falls on earth. It can work as screen to filter out majority of sun rays.

3. This protective layer of Kachra will also safeguard our ~~kulcha~~ civilization from fatal ~~terrorist~~ meteorite crashes.

4. Since the supply of Kachra is unlimited, soon we might be able to increase the viable real estate of earth. Also, satellites/rockets can be designed and operated as airlines, since this new belt can be used to land rockets, destined for nearby planets.

5. Tourism opportunity, plenty of folks are  avid fans of night sky and stars, since this belt is close to sky and stars, they would love this new belt.
