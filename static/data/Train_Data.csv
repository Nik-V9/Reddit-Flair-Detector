"Coronavirus: Here’s how India is planning to unwind 21-day lockdown **Priorities** 

> “in the next few weeks, testing, tracing, isolation and quarantine should remain the areas of focus”  

External situation 

> “far from satisfactory” and there was speculation of a “possible second wave of the spread of the virus in some countries”. 

**Phase wise unwinding of lockdown** 

> people should not come out in hundreds on the roads. PM suggested that the lifting of the lockdown be staggered, earmarking some days for vehicles, other days for cyclists, and that fewer people should be in offices.  

&#x200B;

> PM told the Chief Ministers that the country may need to enforce social distancing **at least until Diwali.** 

**Continuation of lockdown in some areas**

> “a limited lockdown” in some areas is an option that seems to be gaining ground.  

&#x200B;

> it may not be possible to reach a zero-new-case situation by April 14, the best option would be to focus on specific “pockets” to contain the spread 

**Railway Ministry**

>Zones are typically set to indicate to the Railway Ministry in the coming days if they have the capability to start with 25 per cent of the usual services scaled up to 50 per cent and the like depending on the government’s lockdown strategy 

**Civil aviation Ministry**

> “Now, what do the airlines do as a part of their contingency planning and to prepare for the future, it is entirely up to the airline. There is no directive from us,”

"[Career Advice] Exploring opportunity in IT sector. Hi fellow Indians. 

I would like your advice on prospective career development in IT sector. Though I am already working in field of art - photography, graphic designing, video editing etc. I am now looking for something new in IT as it has always been something that I am being recommended since past 20 years so thought why not give it a go. Those who are already in this field, please let me know what are my options. 

Let me first tell you about myself so that you may know where I stand right now and where should I begin. 

• I love learning about new technology, how it works, whats going on in background etc. I do easily figure out behind the scenes of a hardware or software by using it for a while or maybe after a bit of research. That’s why I am good at troubleshooting because I can easily identify the fault and works towards it and don’t even hesitate to go into rabbit hole if the problem demands it. 

• I also am a bit of tinkerer and like to develop my own things like using raspberry pi to make ot into my door opener, use it as DNS blocker (/r/pihole), make it into my own Alexa device, hosting my own websites and hardening the security of it etc. And now a days I am tinkering with NodeMCU to use it for home automation using the HomeKit by Apple. 

• Speaking of Apple, I love breaking the boundaries set by it in their iOS and do more than an average user (/r/Jailbreak). Because of things I mentioned in first point, I am also good at troubleshooting unique problems that only I am facing due to the combinations of tweaks I made in the system.

• Although I can understand most of the code and figure out the problem/BTS, modify it a bit according to my preference but I can not code the whole thing myself. 

Please let me know if this is enough to begin with or should I learn more before even thinking about any course or training. Also based on my information, what are my options and where should I start. 

If you are still reading, I thank you from the bottom of my heart for taking out time.",Photography
"Seattle city council becomes the first US legislative body to pass a resolution against CAA. Full video of the hearing and the vote that followed. This resolution was tabled on January 21st because some of the council members thought they needed to do more research after receiving an email from the Council General of India. 

It was scheduled for a hearing and vote at 2pm today. It has been a long and emotional day. There were around 200-300 people supporting the resolution and probably not more than 80 who were supporting CAA and against the resolution. They were in minority but were the loudest and were there at the city hall since 7 in the morning. Since they were first in line, they got to register for the hearing first and got the opportunity to speak. [Here is the full video of the hearing and the vote.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwygRQ6oXuQ)

One after the other they came and spoke lies about how CAA has nothing to do with Indians. They talked about how minorities are being prosecuted in Pakistan/Bangladesh, how women are being forcefully converted or raped in these countries, or how minorities went from 25% to 5% in these countries(without any source for that information). Some argued that Seattle should deal with its own problems of homelessness, drugs and crime instead of ""falling prey to hate-mongering"". One person even claimed that there is a [genocide of Hindus going on in India and the population of Hindus went down to 65%.](https://youtu.be/WwygRQ6oXuQ?t=1920) Many people laughed at that. Some accused the council member Kshama Sawant and her political aspirations and her ""ulterior motives"" behind this resolution. Some even went on to claim that all these protests against CAA are sponsored by Pakistan/ISI. [And when there was finally a group to speak in favor of the resolution, the bhakts started heckling and shouting at them and the the hearing was suspended,](https://youtu.be/WwygRQ6oXuQ?t=2798) which they knew would happen. When the hearing was resumed it was back to them and their lies.

After the public hearing, the council member Sawant [gave an amazing speech supporting the resolution](https://youtu.be/WwygRQ6oXuQ?t=4463) and she was constantly being heckled. And then there was [this](https://youtu.be/WwygRQ6oXuQ?t=5106) comment from another council member who could see the bigotry through all the comments made by the bhakts.

In the end, truth prevailed and the council members voted 5 out of 5 in favor of the resolution. 

Right when it was apparent that the resolution was going to be passed, the bhakts started [creating a ruckus](https://youtu.be/WwygRQ6oXuQ?t=5574) and after multiple warnings, security was called and they were asked to leave the hall. The way the acted was embarrassing to say the least.",Scheduled

What is the status of the Waste Segregation and City Compost Policy under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan which were supposed to be taken up in 2017?


Sustainable solutions for agriculture, waste management, pollution ++ do not cost much. Why can’t the bureaucracy look at such solutions?


Why not learn from China, how it brought down pollution in Beijing during the last few years?




FARMERS AND AGRARIAN DISTRESS


Quote
Indian farmers have, for long, ensured that the country does not face any food shortage. The time has finally come for the PM to declare: “I am confident Indian farmers can feed the nation, I annul the Essential Commodities Act”. The most critical reform to revolutionise Indian agriculture requires no money. It requires something far harder to acquire — learning to unlearn yesterday’s wisdom.

What was the actual purpose of demonetisation ? Did it yield any results? How much effective was it in combating counterfeit currency and curbing terrorism? Why does RBI takes so much time to count all the notes?
Why petrol not included in the GST?


Why Alcohol not included in the GST?


How this government understand the final effect/result of any project they rollout.(e.g Jan Dhan/ Ganga /Demonetization / etc)


Do they really care about ground reality, if yes then please tell the procedure? 


Do they have any deadline to get the feedback / Complete the process.

Why was autonomous status forced down on Universities?


Do you have a good word or not on the changes brought about in Delhi schools by a different govt?

Why is there an urgency to bring in the No Detention policy, without setting up a proper lower education infrastructure where the teachers are asked not only to teach but sent on census duty and election duty etc?'


Why is only 3% of the budget being concentrated on the education? Why haven't you shared the cess collected in the development of the schools? 


Research fellows from IIT will be paid Rs. 70000 as stipend. Why not extend this from other institutions too? For instance, JRFs are given Rs. 25k, SRF’s Rs. 28k and RA’s Rs. 35k-40k


How difficult is it to disburse Central government fellowships to research students on time? Even with the DBT scheme in place, why are research students not receiving fellowship money for 10 months?


What about Jio University? Which factors indicated it to be ranked as an eminent institute?


JOBS



If the Hon PM is so concerned about the lack of data on jobs, then why was the annual labour survey of employment -unemployment discontinued on his watch after 2016?


Experts in the field of solid waste management know that the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan can become the biggest employer, and solve several issues. But state govts and municipalities continue their nexus with contractors who charge astronomical sums for waste-handling equipment and for transportation of waste. Why is a well-intended mission being defeated by the (lower) bureaucracy? Civic action groups must be involved.


New pension scheme: Is it a good idea to link pensions to the stock market?

How are the retrospective amendments to FCRA wrt political contributions tenable?


What is the sense behind having a non-transparent electoral bond mechanism for donating to Political parties?


Why did you allow the secrecy in election bond ? And by keeping it known to bank govt have direct control on data.




ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY



See for example the ""National Voluntary Guidelines on Social, Environmental and Economic Responsibilities of Business"". http://www.mca.gov.in/Ministry/pdf/DraftNationalGuidelines2018_20062018.pdf


Question: Do the #NVGs (National Voluntary Guidelines) apply to banks? And the Government itself? Our govts are unable to ensure compliance to mandatory laws. How will the #NVGs work out?


The PM speaks of combating corruption, Then why the electoral bonds and Removing provisions of RTI, which kills the transparency all the more? 


Why no appointment according to the Lokpal act? Can modiji explain why the RTI is being weakened?


Where is the data on demonetization and its effects (both positive and negative)?


Why did gov legalise foreign funding of political parties? That too retrospectively?


Why isnt any serious action taken on Panama Papers, where a country like pakistan can send their ex pm to jail for it?




Q) Does Modi and people in his party think all people are idiots? Serious Question since they keep on barking on without facts or figures and just talks as the teenage me fighting against my parents talking random shit that doesn’t matter in the context.


--There are still a lot of people who still support modi even after seeing the evidences. They are mostly carried by the Hindutva narrative.( And these are educated people working in very big MNCs, living in metro cities)


Modi should answer the priority his government has given to basic education in government schools, employment opportunities and healthcare facilities?


Can the government please explain why the states have not been given a part of the 2.35 lac crores collected in the form of cess in 2016-17?


Environment is suffering , what is the take of Modi government to tackle pollution and save natural resources(water, forests)?

 What are the measures taken by the govt for overall protection of women in the society in the wake of recent spike in rapes?


Why arent police being recruited in full force? There are vacancies in large numbers in almost every state? 


Does the govt care about the people being lynched willy nilly by people taking law into their own hands or do they think it's not the govt responsibility to ensure the safety and security of its citizens?


Why hasn’t the Central government passed the Women’s reservation bill in Lok Sabha which is due from 2008 after being passed in Rajya Sabha?


Who handles PM’s social media accounts? If it's done by PMO, what steps have been taken to avoid encouraging anti social elements on SM, especially given the fact that PM’s twitter account follows people found giving online rape threats and abuses to women/journalists/ministers.


Why did the bjp take a 4 long years to decide n use the “nirbhaya funds” on women safety issues? Doesn't this blatantly show how much the gov is serious n care for women safety?? Especially girls r subjected to violence every second in the co (Nirbhaya funds were alloted after the gruesome delhi rape case.)


What’s the current status on the Uniform Civil Code?



FEDERAL DEMOCRACY


1. It is obvious that a number of states with different parties in power are doing some things right, going by the positive outcomes. Federal Democracy is here to stay. But the needs of citizens within different states are quite different. Respect regional aspirations. One size cannot fit all, ever, in India, or elsewhere.


2. Why is the gov increasingly taking democratic institutions for granted? Ex: using governor states to boss around in the administrative matter of state government. Ex: tamilnadu, new delhi, puducherry, karnataka.



HEALTH CARE



Why does the government not take inspiration from NHS scheme in the UK (which provides efficient and great healthcare to UK residents)?


Why does the gov not allocating enough budget for health care despite india ranking low in HDI even with our neighbours countries ?




OTHER



Is it unparliamentary to hug someone in parliament as suggested by Bhupendra Chaubey?


Why are ministers with unscientific viewpoint still given cabinet portfolios?


Why does government not invest in Cyber Security like other major countries like China, Russia and USA? Our government websites and databases are not fully secured (as evident from data being accessed by fs0ciety from AP govt. website) We have great Security Engineers, but they are all employed in Private Sector.


Why was AAP asked to repay the amount they spent from government treasury on advertisement, but BJP keeps plastering Modi’s photo everyday in the newspapers and online advertisement (nearly Rs 4600 crores) without any repercussions?

"Do you feel that Point of view of general public is slightly changed about our PM after yesterday's events? I mean come on, you've got to give him some credit. He landed in bengaluru from two day visit of Russia at afternoon of 7th September. In a day he did meet few people, went to ISRO center at 1:30 AM midnight of 8th September, stayed there late until 2:45 AM, though mission did not go as planned & though with heavy heart he left the place after giving a small speech of encouragement to scientists. Immediately in morning at 8:00 AM, he gave speech at ISRO, Bengaluru facility acknowledging scientists & the nation about Lander mission failure. After that we saw a moving interaction between crying ISRO chief and PM comforting him. This interaction really gave me chills and will be forever etched on my memory. A PM of nation comforting a crying ISRO chief on his shoulders. 

Well, If you think he stopped there, then you are mistaken. He immediately embarked plane to attain the inauguration ceremony of launch of new Mumbai metro lines. He gave a speech there. But before that he didn't forget to attain a 100th anniversary of local Ganapati Mandal. At noon he left Mumbai for Aurangabad, to facilitate 8th crore beneficiary under Ujjwala scheme and to open First Greenfield Smart city there. Another speech. And lastly at the end of the day, he was planned to visit Nagpur but due to heavy rains forecast he unfortunately had to cancel.

"Was Vallabhbhai Patel a bigot or are the bjp using his name. As far as I know or have read, he unbanned rss from congress and on the death of Gandhi wanted to ban rss completely.

I understand people can be wrong at times but if BJP is using his face is there any political philosophy that sardar had that resonates with BJPs goals.

"Is it worth doing MBBS from cheap colleges in West European countries? For background, I was an average student till 8th grade. After that I spent my next 4 most important years of my education studying even less and became a lower-than-average type of student. I took up PCB in high school just because my maths was weaker than my bio. It took my 12th boards and multiple entrance exams for me to realize how bad I was. This was in 2018. So I asked my parents for a year so I could prepare for NEET 2019. I then cut myself off from the internet and studied like hell for it. But only a year wasn't enough for me to even be qualified for NEET 2019. I was short 2 marks. This year I took admission in BALLB in a crappy college. I am pretty sure if I prepare for NEET 2020 this year (along with studies of my first year BALLB), I will qualify. But would it be worth doing MBBS abroad? My parents are willing to spend upto 25 lacs as tuition fee for MBBS. Should I take it? Please help me figure this out.",AskIndia

"Why isn’t scholastic wrestling not a part of extra curriculum in Indian Schools despite wrestling being a popular sport in Indian culture? Wrestling or kushti in hindi seems to be one of the most popular indian sports and martial art of India. The history of Akharas makes it look like India really is into wrestling. So much that often time whenever a normal indian fights you can see him using a crude style of wrestling.

But despite all the cultural history wrestling is not a sport ever present in Indian schools while American schools all have a good wrestling team with them.

This seems like a result of bad mentality among Indians that sports are a waste of time and study is everything that matters.

"[R] Why are Indians blindly running after MONEY??? What i dont understand is that why do Indians run for Money!!!. Wherever i look, everyday, i see Indians trying to get squeeze every inch of a penny from customers, trying to sell everything possible. etc. 

The people working for salaries like 50k or even 90k or 1.5L a month, don't actually have a life. to be honest ( MY opinion)

Okay, a person earning 1.5 L a month (like a cousin in delhi does) is extremely busy all the time. I have seen high earning salaried class, going to offices from 7 AM (2 hour drive) , returning at 10pm. Sometimes, they are thrown away to projects in other cities for months at a time. 

And in some places, Saturdays are also working. and on top of that, fierce competition, stress, anxiety. 

I know a person earning 3L a month. He has to go to office at 8am, and he returns at 11pm. He works in exports (Merchandiser). The stress he is in everyday in unbelievable. He suffers from insomnia and panic attacks. Is this MONEY worth your health???

People are dying In exchange for What? MONEY? shit doesnt get more stupid then this. 

Before people start burning me and asking me how i live my life. I basically started from scratch with clear goals in Mind when i made my own company at age of 21
1) Work only 4 hours a day
2) Holidays - 2 atleast in a year
3) No Stress related work
4) Debtfree forever
5) Self-Sustaining income
6) Passive income from investments

Today, even if i dont work, i can live through my life from passive income. Hell, i can live even without passive income. 

And a lot of Indians can live like the way i live. But they choose not to , for one simple reason. MORE MONEY. 

A lot of people i know personally. like 95% of them, live under loans. Car loans, house loans, credit card lines, PC limits, etc. They are basically stuck in a vicious circle of being a spend thrift and then working their asses off to pay the monthly obligations and creating more obligations for themselves for a FAKE future. 

Although when you transfer yourself into a more frugal and acceptable way of living, you will realise that the true happiness if being with your family, spending time with kids, chilling out in the sun and not thinking you will be late for office. And most importantly, being DEBT-FREE. Only after that you can think of creating Self-Sustaining earning for yourselves. 

Just ask yourself few questions and maybe they don't all apply to you, and maybe a few of them do. But if they do, just think why are you doing this? and creating Stress for yourself.
1. Why do you need a phone that costs 40k+?
2. Why do you need to buy a house on loan?
3. Why buy a car on loan? 
4. Why spend what you dont have yet (C.C.)
5. Why work more than 45 Hours a week? 
6. Why you go on a holiday and post pictures on facebook EVERYTIME? (Occasionally its okay)
7. Why do you put pictures of the food you eat on Insta, FB, Twitter??? 
8. Does it feel like, you are travelling to various places just to put pictures on your facebook and insta??? and if it does, why do you do it?
9. Dont you feel that your Job is hindering in doing what you actually LIKE? (Travelling, Hiking, Trekking, Exploring) etc.
10. Even if you can afford the most expensive phones? why do you ACTUALLY need it? have you asked yourself that? 
11. Have you lost touch with various people you loved? and WHY have you? Lack of TIME?
12. Do you want to learn something technical and CANT DO SO EVER? (Guitar, photography, boating, climbing, learning a piano, learning another language)

These are just A FEW of the things, which everyone of you must ask yourself. Because ultimately at the end, We are all going to die, one way or another. And to be brutally honest, a lot of people are going to regret how they lived their life. Not everything is about ""MORE MONEY"". And when you die, most probably you will be forgotten in 50 years. and that too if you become a celebrity. Otherwise, chances are you will be forgotten instantly. 

I have even seen people mentioning a ""BALANCE"". What balance? that you work for 6 days a week for 8 hours a day and then Sunday is a BALANCE? because that shit doesn't sound like a 50/50 balance to me. We sleep around 8 hours a day. And the rest of activities we SHOULD be doing in a day would constitute for around 7-8 hours (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Exercise, Errands). What you are left with is about 8 hours FREE. in which most of you only WORK. Exercise is totally forgotten. and even that 2 hours for exercise is given to work. 

Where is the time for yourself? to contemplate? to think? to feel about yourself? to do things you ACTUALLY want to do? 

I think even working for 4 hours a day is TOO MUCH. and should infact be only 2-3 hours. 

Money is just something the BANKS have created out of thin air, on which they ask you to pay an interest!!!. 

Have you thought about where the INTEREST money comes from which you pay??? . You guessed it, BANKS print them too. There is no Way out of the DEBT system. 

Only changes in your lifestyle and the way you feel about the world can result in self sustainable income and environment , where you can do things you want. 

Think about these things deeply.

"Custom Firmware on Jio GigaFiber Router I left Jio Gigafiber and I have the FTTH router with me but it has modified firmware by Jio which blocks using services from any other ISP. Is it possible to install a custom firmware on this router as I have read online that there are custom firmware built for routers for many reasons and developing one for this will be helpful as it’s a good looking and sturdy router with decent range and there are many people like me who have not got their money back so I plan on using this router with another service provider. 

Why I left JioGigafiber?

I got the Jio GigaFiber after giving into the hype of Refundable Deposit &amp; Free High Speed Internet Services until the services are made public. After a week, I started facing issues in the services mainly pertaining to Internet Speed which was not stable, it  used to fluctuate between 15-65 Mbps with 2-3 days of very slow &amp; unstable internet almost every week, which sounds decent for a free trial subscription but is not worth replacing main internet connection service. Anyway, after complaining about it to the Jio Team and asking for the Refundable deposit back, it’s been over 45 days - which is the stipulated time to receive my money back, I have not yet got a single penny and so I decided to use the FTTH router.",Science/Technology

"We really need to talk about Flairs. Hello /r/india  
  
Here are some clarifications on submission flairs, since we see a lot of mis-flaired posts from time to time.  
  
**[P] - Political**  
  
These are for political posts only. If a post involved any politician, political party or anything primarily related to politics, then it must be flaired as political  
  
**[NP] - Non-political**  
  
These are for discussions where you are confident there is no politics involved. You cannot flair a post that is primarily or tangentially related to politics with an NP tag.  
 
This is important because quite a few people use the filters we have on the sidebar to filter out political (or non-political) posts, and misflairing one as the other may irritate these users.  
  
**[R] - Reddiquette**  
  
When this flair is selected, Reddit's Reddiquette guidelines are enforced in the thread, along with certain other restrictions so as to have a slightly higher quality discussion.    
  
Jokes, puns and low effort comments will be removed in such threads.
  
This can be used for both political and non-political topics.  
  
**[ASK] - AskIndia**  
  
These are flairs for self-posts where the OP wants to ask the community a question. You cannot use this flair for link posts (because that makes no sense unless ToI or HT wants to ask /r/india a question).  
  
If the question is political in nature, then the thread must be flaired with P or R, not with AskIndia. This is to prevent filters from being breached.  
  
**Science & Technology** 

This flair is for topics with an explicit, mostly non-political science & technology bent to it. If it tangentially involves politics, it is fine to use this flair in place of [P].   
 
If Modi makes a comment about the ISRO, then it is a P thread.  
If the ISRO conducts some research that points to where state governments can improve with irrigation, and a politician comments on that, then it can be flaired with Science & Technology assuming the primary focus of the story isn't the politician's comment.  

**Policy & Economy**
  
These flairs work similarly. The main topic of the subject matter should be about policy or economy. The instant the focus shifts to politics, political parties, politicians, etc. the flair must be [P].  

**Business & Finance**  

These flairs are for articles, or self-post submissions with a non-political, business bent to them. If you want to know where to invest or if Ola Cabs decides to go public, then this is the flair for you.  
  
**Entertainment** 

Entertainment flair is exclusively for pop-culture links, submissions, and discussions. Examples under this flair include movie trailers, movie clips, comics, YouTube joke sketches and things along those lines.  
  
This flair cannot be used for some politician saying something absurd, funny or ridiculous. That constitutes an editorialization of the title on the part of the OP - since the OP insinuates that the subject matter is funny with the title (instead of letting the reader make up their mind).   
 
**Sports and Food** 

Sports & Food flairs are very self-explanatory  

**AMA**
  
AMA flairs are given to OPs who verify their identity with the mod team. In case they choose not to verify, they will get an **Unverified** flair.  
  
**In-Depth**

This flair must be used carefully.This flair *only* used when you need an In-depth discussion about the topic. Top comments must have a proper explanation/discussion about the top. Top comments must fulfil the word limit else the comment **will** get deleted by all mighty automod.

---  
PS - In the event of confusion, just go for Reddiquette.
  
Recommendations for new flairs may be made below.  ",Policy/Economy

"Some things I need to get off my chest about India's sexism Hello, I'm Indian on my dad's side but I don't live in India (I won't tell my location for privacy reasons). I have been there a couple times but never lived there so my opinion might not count. I won't pretend that I know fully what it's like to be a women in India but I know the pressure that my community puts on me even if we don't live there.

What I wanted to tell is something that has been weighing on my heart for a long time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Watching the news, hearing the stories my dad tells me about his female friends, walking around in the Indian neighborhood of my city... all of that hurt me very very deeply.  I'm not saying that all Indian men are like that, no, not at all. I'm saying that the eduction provided by society, the parents, schools, and the internet has led me to a conclusion that might not please everyone. 

&amp;#x200B;

Most Indian men I meet (not all!) have very predatory behaviour. I live in a city where I see more immigrants from all over the world than locals, but I almost only experience that kind of arrassment around them. Some have said very vile things in front of older shop owners who wouldn't defend me, but rather look down upon me because I went out there without my dad. To them that's the reason why I deserve to be treated like that. The only times I've been followed on the street and on the trains were with Indian men. I seriously don't want to come to this conclusion, but it's the truth.

They have no respect for women, they think you're just a piece of meat waiting to be bought, touched. Women are considered a source of income with the dowry. Did you know that the dowry must go to the wife after a marriage? And did you know that traditionally, the women is supposed to control the money in a marriage? Or did you know that it's stritcly forbidden in Hinduisim to ask for more dowry? (source: my dad, a brahman) 

And look where we are now... Women getting attacked with acid, raped, shaved, tortured, because the husband, or his family, is greedy. Greed will be the downfall of India, of civilization.

&amp;#x200B;

I love India with all my heart. It's my country, my nation, my people. I feel so confortable thinking of India, my family over there, but this has to stop. Women need to take actions, fast. I get so angry when I read the news, I cry just thinking about the state of the nation. A woman gave you your life, she carried you, cared for you and you dare treat another woman this way? 

&amp;#x200B;

What bothers me the most is that Indian men (the okay ones) leave that problem to the women, they don't wanna get involved. They don't help their Indian sisters, won't defend them, they stay silent... Silence is also a form of assault. Please, if you're a men witnessing a form of assault, help your Indian sisters.

So yes of course women need to take actions, be as violent as the men if need be. We have been told to hold back our anger to please. Please who? The elders who contribute to rape culture? The future husband who might not like your words of protest because he feels attacked ? Frick that. Fight back. They wanna be violent, so be it. 

Women: create groups, go after those who have hurt you but never payed the price of justice. Try to be as legal as possible, but if the law doesn't do justice, make your own justice. Remember that sometime ago, slavery was still legal. The justice system tolerated it, but it was immoral. If the system tolerated assault against women, fight back. That's the only way.",Politics
"No, Indians don't have any special immunities to diseases owing to our lifestyles, Nor has our bodies acclimatized to constant environmental stress that has made us inherently stronger ! India has indeed made huge progress in citizens overall improvement in health over the last two decades. And this is owing to us adopting several international standards of healthcare delivery and adoption of vaccine programmes suggested by WHO. 

Leading causes of death among indians is heart disease , pulmonary diseases, diarrheal diseases, strokes, diabetes etc. The lifespan of Indian citizens are lower than most developed countries , we are below world average and 135th country in the list of highest lifespans. 

Now environmental factors have a big contribution for most of the above cases too. 
Your daily pollution at home, roads and everywhere is giving your diseases and lowers your overall health not superpower to survive anywhere. 

Diarrhea kill count shouldn't be this high even for a developing nation. The unhealthy lifestyle and food cleanliness and living habits contributes to this. I regularly get called a germophobe for using hand santizers and refusing to eat at certain places. Apparently it's not macho to live like this.

Diabetes cases are rising and unfortunately our diet isn't as balanced as we think it is. The excess carbs, oil and sugar arent good just because thats how our ancestors ate for 1000s of years. Their lifestyle was different. 

Let's not gloat in the false notion that just because we are infected with one virus scarring the world , that we are somehow above such measly issues.",Food

"COVID-19 - Information &#x200B;

These are the collection of data from various resources.

# Corona virus - What it is?

Novel - First time human immunity system is being exposed to this virus

Corona virus - Family of viruses with crown shape

**Symptoms**

Please **monitor your temperature if you have dry cough**. If you get high temperature & any of the mentioned symptoms in point 2, please seek medical advise. In a case, if you have sore throat , please practice social distancing and isolate yourself.

The “incubation period” means the time between catching the virus and  beginning to have symptoms of the disease. Most estimates of the  incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, most commonly  around five days. These estimates will be updated as more data become  available.

The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are

1. **fever, tiredness, and dry  cough** (The AND is important point to note\*\*)\*\*.
2. Some patients may have **aches and pains**, **nasal congestion**, **runny  nose**, **sore throat** or **diarrhea (Apart from mentioned above)**.
3. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually.
4. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell.
5. **Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease  without needing special treatment**.
6. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.
7. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood  pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop  serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing  should seek medical attention.

**Spreading**

People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose  or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales.  These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other  people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then  touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if  they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or  exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter  (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.

**Asymptomatic Spreading**

&#x200B;

1. If a person is asymptomatic, it is highly that he is not communicating the disease till he follows a good personal hygiene.

The main way the disease spreads is **through respiratory droplets**  expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from  someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many people with  COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the  early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19  from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel  ill.  WHO is assessing ongoing research on the period of transmission of  COVID-19 and will continue to share updated findings. 

# How to protect yourself

You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:

&#x200B;

1. **WASH your hands** : Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.
2. Maintain at least 1 meter (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.Why?  When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from  their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you  can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person  coughing has the disease.
3. Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.Why?  Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated,  hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there,  the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.
4. Make sure  you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This  means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when  you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.Why?  Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you  protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and  COVID-19.
5. Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever,  cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in  advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.Why?  National and local authorities will have the most up to date information  on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your  health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility.  This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other  infections.
6. Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19  hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is      spreading  widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places  – especially if you are  an older person      or have diabetes, heart or lung disease.Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.
7. Self - isolation period should be 5-14 days.[Guidelines for Home Quarantine](https://www.mohfw.gov.in/pdf/Guidelinesforhomequarantine.pdf)
8. Please call ahead if you are visiting a doctor.

**Please make sure if you use mask , you know how to handle it. Incorrect handling and using of mask will lead you in troubles (touching front of the mask, not disposing it , touching mask again and again to adjust it)**

Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially  coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19. Disposable  face mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or looking after  someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is a world-wide  shortage of masks, so WHO urges people to use masks wisely.

WHO advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary wastage of precious resources and mis-use of masks  ([see Advice on the use of masks](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks)).

The  most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are  to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow  or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from  people who are coughing or sneezing. See  [basic protective measures against the new coronavirus](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks) for more information.

Guidelines for home qurantine

## Recommendations for travelers

It is prudent  for travelers who are sick to delay or avoid travel to affected areas,  in particular for elderly travelers and people with chronic diseases or  underlying health conditions.

General recommendations for  personal hygiene, cough etiquette and keeping a distance of at least one  meter from persons showing symptoms remain particularly important for  all travelers. These include:

* Perform hand hygiene  frequently, particularly after contact with respiratory secretions. Hand  hygiene includes either cleaning hands with soap and water or with an  alcohol-based hand rub. Alcohol-based hand rubs are preferred if hands  are not visibly soiled; wash hands with soap and water when they are  visibly soiled;
* Cover your nose and mouth with a flexed elbow or  paper tissue when coughing or sneezing and disposing immediately of the  tissue and performing hand hygiene;
* Refrain from touching mouth and nose;
* A  medical mask is not required if exhibiting no symptoms, as there is no  evidence that wearing a mask – of any type – protects non-sick persons.  However, in some cultures, masks may be commonly worn. If masks are to  be worn, it is critical to follow best practices on how to wear, remove  and dispose of them and on hand hygiene after removal (see [Advice on the use of masks](https://apps.who.int/iris/rest/bitstreams/1269003/retrieve))

As for any travel, travelers are also advised to follow proper food hygiene practices, including [the five keys for food safety](https://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/consumer/en/5keys_en.pdf?ua=1&ua=1), as well as [recommendations to reduce the risk of transmission of emerging pathogens from animals to human in live markets](https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus/who-recommendations-to-reduce-risk-of-transmission-of-emerging-pathogens-from-animals-to-humans-in-live-animal-markets).

# Actions taken by Gov of India

Now this is crucial part. India is a federal state and cannot impose restrictions directly as it is a state matter, until or unless Emergency is invoked.

Timeline of measures and recommendations to states:

**20th of March**

* Recommendation for implementation of social distancing measures
   * 50 per cent of Group B and C employees are required to attend office every day, and the remaining 50 per cent staff should be instructed to work from home.

   * Working hours for all employees who attend office on a particular day should be staggered.
   * Further, States shall issue instructions for regulating hours in all services except for essential services. Industrial establishments to consider staggered timings and regulation of crowd in market should also be resorted to.
   * States shall issue directions to private sector to consider work from home wherever feasible.
   * All educational institutions, theatres, museums, gyms, exam centers, etc., shall be closed temporarily.
   * States shall take necessary actions to ensure that all sporting events, competitions and religious gatherings shall be postponed and it shall be ensured that required social distanced is maintained even in smaller gatherings.
   * With respect to public transport, it is directed that metros, railways, buses and airplanes shall consider decrease in frequency of their services, **alternate seating to ensure social distancing**.  Effective disinfection and crowd management be ensured in places like railway stations, metro stations, bus stands, and airports.

   * Further, in order to protect the most vulnerable of our population, all states shall issue appropriate instructions where in all citizens above 65 years except for public representatives/government servants/medical professionals should be advised to remain at home and avoid gatherings except for medical reasons and need for essential services.
   * **Youth and citizens are urged to become volunteers to support the government’s ongoing efforts in management of COVID-19.**
   * Ministry of Pharma and Consumer Affairs to take necessary action against anyone charging exorbitant price for masks, sanitizers, and other health related logistic material and to facilitate their availability in all hospitals and to people at large. They also directed that people should be sensitized on appropriate use of masks, to be utilized only when needed and to wash hands with soap.

&#x200B;

**8th of March \[**[**https://www.mohfw.gov.in/pdf/COVIDCabSecLetterGuidelines.pdf**](https://www.mohfw.gov.in/pdf/COVIDCabSecLetterGuidelines.pdf)**\]**

Some of the steps proposed:

&#x200B;

"Appreciation to Maharashtra Government Read the post-script if you feel that I am wrong at any line. (Post Script is at the end)

I am neither related to any political party nor I want to support or say bad about any Political Party. This post is just to appreciate Maharashtra Government and to give reason for people in Maharashtra to support the Government to fight against Coronavirus.

The steps that Maharashtra Government took to fight against Coronavirus may look drastic and unnecessary but I wish to say something about it. Many developed countries like USA, Spain, Italy etc. have taken these measures after the virus spread. In Maharashtra as of today morning, according to news channels, although there were 49 infected people, 40 of them came from other countries and just 9 were the ones who were in contact with the affected. For a  heavily populated country like India, these numbers are almost unbelievable. If the government did not take such drastic measures, these numbers would not have been so small. I agree that these measures disturb our schedule and many think that this is just a step by Medical Industries to increase income but WHO wouldn't have taken the steps during already going on recession.

These numbers are better than many Developed countries. We have to appreciate Maharashtra Government for their hardwork and co-operate with them. If everyone cooperates with the Government then Government will surely loosen the restrictions and we will have less trouble. 

Don't overestimate your immune system and don't assume that you won't get infected. Just follow the instructions given out by the Health Minister.

"Why doesn't the locked Mukesh Ambani page on Wikipedia have a controversy section? [AskIndia] This is the Wikipedia page for [Mukesh Ambani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mukesh_Ambani). It is locked, fairly simpering in nature, and lacks any controversy section.

The equivalent entry on [Dhirubhai Ambani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhirubhai_Ambani) is not locked but is also fairly blank in its description. 

Wikipedia is supposed to a neutral entry for human knowledge curated by the community. In instances where an article is repeatedly vandalized or at constant risk of vandalization, it can be expected to be ""locked"" from edits that are not approved by a higher power.

I'm not the first to mention this. One Quora user (in a post titled ""How corrupt is Mukesh Ambani?
"") described his attempt to edit the page and how it was stumped by higher-level editors.

In the case of India's richest and most powerful person, it is understandable that certain information is undesirable in the public realm. However, that does not mean we should bow our heads.

Finding out anything about the Ambani's is notoriously difficult. Sure, you could follow newspaper headlines over the least few years but they have a tendency of being fickle. Remember when Ambani's kid mowed someone over in an Aston Martin? Or when the family was involved in a [bitter feud](https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/cover-story/story/19890831-bombay-dyeing-reliance-feud-ril-executive-arrested-on-charge-of-conspiring-to-kill-nusli-wadia-816444-1989-08-31) with Nusli Wadia (that culminated in a murder charge)?

The saga of Ambani is too vast to remember everything. Only a person who reads the paper every day for the last 75 years will know their true history and even then he knows just a fraction. I admit, I don't know enough. But I do know that there is a concerted attempt to control information about Reliance.

We see it in [Reliance ownership of the media](https://caravanmagazine.in/vantage/the-big-five-the-media-companies-that-the-modi-government-must-scrutinise-to-fulfill-its-promise-of-ending-crony-capitalism), in their purchase and regulation of our satire ([they even bought out FakingNews.com](https://www.medianama.com/2013/05/223-firstpost-fakingnews/) in its early days - understanding early that such sites could be far more critical than investigatory journalists and far more apt as well). We see it in [near billion dollar](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/rafale-row-anil-ambani-files-rs-5000-crore-defamation-suit-against-national-herald-congress-leader/articleshow/65546040.cms) defamation cases. We see it when books that try to tell this story [are banned from being published in India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Polyester_Prince).

You know what is happening. I know what is happening. We all know it. Anyone on the street will tell you this and that about how Ambani pulls every string. And I will be the first to be realistic. 

**However, an open ledger of information does not have the same weakness as a media organisation that has to pay salaries.** 

Use a proxy and edit. Cite your sources well. What are you doing wrong when it is done in the name of the truth? But before this can even happen, don't we need to get past that lock?

To get an edit made through a semi-protected article, you need to propose an edit on its talk page. 

Honestly, if I knew enough and wasn't afraid myself, I'd make the edits. But I think there might be smarter and better people on here who could give me added perspective. I don't have experience editing Wikipedia and I believe in this happening to a fair standard.

"TIFU by being from a Scheduled Caste but apparently not looking like one Sorry for the dramatic title. Also as TIFUs usually go, this did not happen today but over a period of a month

A little background, I'm a 27 year old male, IIM passout. working in a well known consulting firm earning about 30LPA. I am a sincere, hardworking, simple dude. Since most caste related discussions always end up about reservation, lemme clarify that I never used it. Got 99.4 %ile in CAT, also had got AIR in 600's general in IITJEE. But here's the catch, despite being a Telugu SC, apparently I don't look like one. I am light-skinned and have good facial features I guess.

So I figured I was ready to get married. Since I had no luck on Tinder and was extremely busy to go out and find someone, I created a profile on one of those matrimony websites for professionals because I want an educated, broad-minded working wife. MISTAKE #1. Most of the profiles on there were of girls from highly educated backgrounds and thats the reason I thought I could find someone like me whom I could connect with in terms of principles, attitude toward education/work/life, my agnostic beliefs etc.

I checked the 'Any' option on caste as it doesn't matter to me and figured since this is a place for educated professionals, nobody really cares about caste. MISTAKE #2.

So within a week, I get a fair amount of matches. Some are handled by parents, some handled by the girls themselves. Here are some interesting experiences I had over a period of a month:

1) **Telugu Unkil**: Caste mentioned - Kapu. Says he is ""highly interested"" in my profile. I mail him back saying if he has any caste preferences and that I prefer open-minded people in general. Writes back saying how his daughter is very broad-minded, hates traditional mindset and they are looking for a very liberal family. I think great, I would like to know more about her and we started talking on whatsapp and we seem to hit it off pretty well. 5 days later she asks me my caste and I mention it. Ghosted. No replies, she unfriends me on facebook, blocks me on whatsapp. I move on.


2) **Gril**: Works for a big bank in Mumbai. Mentions 'Any' caste. So I think great. I message her and she accepts it. We exchange numbers and start talking. A week goes by, we have talked about our jobs, future plans, location preferences and want to schedule a personal meetup. She messages me - ""hey I think you should know this, I am from Teli caste which is OBC. Hope your parents are ok?"" I tell her I don't care and neither do my parents. Then I tell her about my caste, and she starts acting weird. Starts replying to my texts in syllables and tries to hang up on my calls. I feel bad and message her asking what ticked her off. She says that she thought I was from an upper caste and that's why she replied to my message. And now she doesn't want to proceed any further and want to cancel all further plans. I told her that it's a bit hypocritical of her that initially she was one wanting my parents to be ok with her being OBC when she thought I was from OC. 


3) **Marathi Auntie**: This one's a bit hilarious. She sends me a message saying she really liked my profile for her daughter. I look it up and sure enough - mentioned 'any caste'. I give her my number and she sends me a complete biodata about her daughter. Daughter is really pretty and from MDI Gurgaon, I think great. But she mentions caste as 'Rigvedi Brahmin'. I think oh f**k. I send her all the details, mention my caste and even bracket it with '(SC)'. Immediately she goes, ""I really like your profile. Tell me the next steps or give me your parents number"". I'm like - this can't be happening. Then it hits me that maybe she has glanced over the caste part in her hurry. So I send another text saying,- ""ma'am pls confirm that you have seen my caste, and it falls under Scheduled Caste"". Never heard back from her.


There are a few more like this. Most of the profiles message me about my caste and go silent when I mention it. I realized that all my life, my circle of friends have ranged from all castes, religions and financial backgrounds and they never made me feel like a dalit or whatever. I have lived a happy and fairly successful life. That was the reason I was ignoring the caste aspect for finding someone to spend my life. 

Now I have learnt my lesson and changed my caste to clearly say SC and will stick to my own I guess. I also feel like giving up on these matrimony websites. It's been a great learning experience about my position in the society folks! :)",Scheduled

"When bhakts ask what Modi could have done for millions of daily wage labourers instead of apologising for their inconvenience... In Odisha:

* All households below poverty line/handicapped /old aged got 120 kg rice for ₹1/per kg. The rice was delivered to their houses.

* All the people eligible for MBPY ( for below poverty line/handicapped/senior citizens) got extra ₹4000 cash to spend on groceries during 21 day lockdown.

* Poor kids studying in “anganwadi” also got some amount of rice and food delivered to them.

* Government Doctors got their salaries of next 4 months, early.

* All the salaries of MLAs and CM of Odisha was donated for the state budget of corona virus treatment.

(I’m missing many other things too, but these are the prominent ones)

All of this was done a week before India went to lockdown. In Odisha you won’t see millions of daily wage labourers migrating to their villages right now, despite it being one of the poorer state in India.

Modi could have at least issued the responsibilities for state government before he declared lockdown overnight.

It’s not even funny when Modi government has got billions for corona virus budget and all they could do was some cheap apology.",Food

"What the fuck is modi doing ? What the fuck is modi doing ? He's unfit to be leader of this country. 

He always touts his horns when representing india by elevating it as world largest democracy. 

Now what ? World's largest democracy' economy is probably will be in ruins by the time this is all over. 

As far as I have gathered:- 

He's not really giving people any financial support. He only urged people to not leave the disadvantaged behind. I understand that. But dude, even people who will be paying them will have no income stream left. 

So what maybe you pay your employees. Will your landlord be generous enough to forget your monthly payments. Maybe he is, but now even he has to pay property tax without any income stream.

He's not providing tax cuts or financing salaries of people. 

Now when this shit storm is all over he doesn't even have any policies if place if he decides a full lockdown. Many business will become bankrupt. Many company will be dissolved. It will be a period of unstable financial turmoil. Many life's will be ruined and that fucker will still not be accountable for all his action ( like erection of 3000 crore statue ) or rather his inaction. 

This could very well lead to another event like Great Depression. Without support from government many people will be laid off and many will become bankrupt. Industrial activities will be delayed as demands will be greatly reduced due to depletion of people's cash reserves.",Policy/Economy

"Need help with Hindutva-subscribed family members *My mother is a radicalized hindutva fanatic, how do I get her out*

My brother and father are liberal, progressive individuals (well more centrist), as am I. However, my mother and her entire side of the family are hindutva believers, who are fervent and obdurate in their belief in a Hindu Rashtra. They constantly espouse and spout beliefs such as ""10 years till the Muslims kills us all"" and ""Muslims go against the fabric of India"" and ""All these Muslims want to establish a  Ghazwa-e-Hind"". 
I am at my wits' end battling their predisposed notions of Muslims, despite them all being highly educated members of society. I bring out facts and statistics, substantiate every WhatsApp message and conversation with citation. Hell, I even forcibly took them to watch Chapaak because they parroted this idiotic newspiece that claimed that the acid attacker's name was changed from Muslim to Hindu because they didn't want to offend the Muslim community as they will riot. (Naturally they were soon disabused of that notion).

Nothing I have done has worked, and it really drives me up a wall when they continue to spread these virulent items of fake news. 

Have any of you gotten to your family, and if so how? I am on the verge of giving up.

"I'm stuck with my career and could use some guidance. I am genuinely lost. This is a long post and I cannot tl;dr it because I need to explain my situation. Sorry about that!

So I am a 27-year-old who is a graphic designer by profession. I have been in this domain for 4 years and I can say I am alright at it. I am definitely not extremely good, but the last two places I worked, they were genuinely happy with my work. I got into this field in a weird way. I always liked to tinker with digital art, photography, etc. and I got a job as a designer straight out of college. Since then, I have worked in this field because I thought it was my passion and it was the only thing I could do to pay my bills. The more I worked in this field, the more I began to dislike graphic design. Over time, it became more of a chore for me. That's when I realized I am not passionate about it and just am in the field just because I have been in it for a while and I have some sense of design. For example, when I was working with a few brands, I just wanted to get the project over with so I can have some peace of mind. There was a lot of room for improvement but I didn't suggest it because more work for me. In the same train of thought, I am more than happy to be told what to do, and I will do it. Many passionate designers I met are completely against that idea. They want to give their own input and genuinely want to help their clients improve, but for me, it's just another deadline that needs to be done with. I also realized, if I have to compete with top designers to get better jobs, I have to improve my skills. Now, I would happily do it if I was genuinely passionate about it, but I know I am not.

I quit my last job in June and have been surviving on my savings since then and now it seems to be running out. Since, June, I was so happy that I don't have to wake up and do this shitty job. I still tinker around with digital art and have fun doing it and that's when I realized I began hating my hobbies because of this job. I am old now to understand this passion and drive I cannot cultivate in this field for sure. Now I have to look for a job. Realistically, I can work for any ad agency or even try my hand out with Amazon (I have already worked with them) or some other corporate where I could get paid a decent amount for some donkey job where I don't have to think much, etc. but I am feeling I will go back to hating my life and work again. I am okay with a boring 9 to 5 job even if it is some mind-numbing work, as long as the pay is alright and timings are decent. I don't expect the perfect life anyways, but I feel I need to change this.

Can any of you give me some solid career advice on this aspect? Should I just suck it up and continue working in this field especially when I am not passionate about it? I feel the only way I can make significant leaps in this field is my striving to constantly improve myself, but to do that, I need to genuinely love the work, which I don't. If not, what other options do I have? Some of my friends were telling me to get into hospitality since I am pretty good at talking to people and managing things and it also has a scope of me to go abroad (which is a long term plan for me). I feel going abroad bit will be severely hindered by graphic design because it's not a that sought after field with which I can move abroad.

If you would suggest I stay in graphic design, are there any schools or courses that can help me? I am a fully self-taught designer so I have never had a proper foundation of design sense and style. I had a helpful mentor in my last job, and he kept telling me don't go for studies in this field, just keep working and you will improve. I learned a lot from him in terms of my work improving and all.

Other than this, are there any other jobs or fields you would suggest?

Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!",Photography

"About the Tablighi Jamat situation I saw this hit piece on Aaj Tak, about how the Jamat members in Ghaziabad allegedly passed lewd remarks at female nurses, sang vulgar songs and dropped their pants, which is absolutely hilarious to me. Of course, you can't put anything past anyone these days, but I highly doubt that the people who spend most of their lives, away from civilization, locked in mosques around the world, praying, and talking about praying when they're not actually praying, would do anything like that. That is literally the mission of the Tablighi Jamat, they're basically Muslim sanyasis. Seriously, it's a matter of pride for them that they have nothing to do with the ""material world"", as they call it. They're literally oblivious, which exactly why they didn't pay heed to the coronavirus situation. Granted, that was extremely dangerous and wrong, but I still very much doubt that these people even know any vulgar songs, much less that they can muster the courage to sing any in unison to harass the nurses. 

Obviously, there is zero proof of any such occurrence. Aaj Tak basically hovered over a letter from the hospital staff for a few seconds, which said that these patients were being uncooperative with no mention of lewd behaviour, while yelling about ""jamatiyon ki kaali kartoot"". Sure, maybe they have been uncooperative because they're stubborn fools, but I doubt the other stuff about them dropping their pants is real lmfao. 

Of course, this is my opinion, based on my knowledge and experiences, and everyone is free to believe what they want, but I'd encourage you to exercise a healthy amount of skepticism while watching news these days. More so when you're sitting with your family, watching channels like Aaj Tak or Zee News (I know boomers love sensationalized news stories). Don't believe any of it until you see absolutely concrete proof. Most people here know this, but these channels are trying to push a narrative (with support from certain people), and they'll go to any lengths to do so. Facts and consequences don't matter to these people, as long as they get more viewers. It's a win-win for them, their overseers get to disseminate propaganda and stay happy with them, while they get TRP. Then they can say things like ""Aaj Tak ne sabko pacchada, no. 1 since the beginning of time"" and rub it in your faces.",Coronavirus

"I Am Amazed and Inspired by Indian Youth I myself am not an Indian national. Rather, I am an American-born Pakistani. I have subscribed to this subreddit because I think it's important to understand the other half of the discussion. 

I don't want my idea of what Indians believe to be made up entirely of my family's steriotypes of what this community is. 

In addition to being of Pakistani descent and from a muslim family, I am also gay. I was shocked when India legalized gay marriage. I always thought Pakistani and Indian culture to be so similar. This was what piqued my interest in India. I wanted to gain a greater understanding of the mentality and political compass of Indians as far as I could understand it through Reddit (which I understand is not necessarily demonstrative of the majority of Indian voters).

Countless times I have been inspired by the Indian Reddit community's relentless efforts to cling to the secular identity of Indian political culture. Time and time again, I read about Indian pride for being the largest democracy. This is in most cases, within the context of a diverse community. People of every faith and every ethnicity all as Indian citizens sharing a common but spectacularly diverse culture.  

I am so glad that I chose to follow this subreddit or I probably wouldn't know that there is in fact a very large population of Indians who object to islamophobia or racist views of the vast subcultures of India. 

So I just wanted to thank everyone who stands for the Indian cultural ideal of tolerance and inclusiveness. It's very inspiring and I hope that bigots around the globe can learn a thing or two from this.

Edit: It has been pointed out that in fact gay marriage has not been legalized, rather, sodomy has been decriminalized. I stand corrected and apologize for this misconception. I do still however maintain that it is an excellent step in the right direction as another commenter has mentioned.",Scheduled

India: How a rich nation became poor and will be rich again

Essays | March 19, 2007 - 12:38

(Developing Cultures : Case Studies, co-edited by Peter Berger and Laurence Harrison, Routledge, 2005.)

Does 'culture' in some way help to explain the fact that the same Indian economy that was stagnating for the first fifty years of the 20th century began to grow at a respectable clip after 1980 and was amongst the fastest growing in the world by the end of the century?

Consider the following hundred year trend: between 1900 and 1950, the Indian economy grew on the average 0.8 percent a year; but the population also grew at about the same rate; thus, net growth in income per capita was nil and we rightly called our colonial economy stagnant. After Independence, economic growth picked up to 3.5 percent between 1950 and 1980, but so did population growth (to 2.2 percent); hence the net affect on income was 1.3 percent per capita, and this is what we mournfully referred to as “the Hindu rate of growth.” Things began to change with modest liberalization in the eighties when annual economic growth rose to 5.6 percent. This happy trend continued in the reform decade of the nineties when growth averaged 6.2 percent a year, while population slowed to 1.8 percent; thus, per capita income rose by a decent 4.4 percent a year.

As a benchmark, recall that the West's industrial revolution took place at a 3 percent GDP growth and 1.1 percent per capita income growth after 1820. To appreciate the magnitude of the Indian change after 1980, let me illustrate: If India's per capita GDP had continued growing at the pre-1980 level, then its income would have reached present American capita income levels only by 2250; but if it continues to grow at the post-1980 rate then it will reach those levels by 2066: a gain of 184 years!

How does one begin to explain India's economic performance over the past hundred years? The Indian nationalist blames the first fifty years' stagnation on British colonialism. But a trade economist will counter this by showing that the world economy was also stagnant in the first half of the 20th century (especially after World War I) when world per capita GDP grew annually at just under one percent.2 The main culprits, he would say, were conflict and autarky. Disgraceful protectionism by most governments between the Wars slowed both the world and the Indian economy.

Although the Indian economy picked up after 1950, the neoclassical economist would argue that it performed below the world economy, which experienced a “golden age” driven by trade expansion until 1971. Like the rest of the Third World India did not benefit from global trade expansion because it had closed its economy and pursued 'import substitution'. Moreover, Nehru's socialism had shackled the economy with fierce controls on the private sector, pejoratively called 'Licence Raj'; hence its annual GDP growth was 1.5 percentage points below even the Third World average between 1950 and 1980.3

This changed dramatically with modest liberal reforms in the 1980s and more sweeping ones in the 1990s as the Indian economy integrated with the world. In those twenty years it not only outperformed the world economy significantly but it was amongst the fastest in the world.4 Thus, gradual technological diffusion, rising capital accumulation and productivity, and gradual education expansion help economists to explain a good deal of the story. There is also the value of time and accumulated learning through time. “Collective learning” is Hayek's term, and he applied it to the cumulative experience that generations build up which is embodied in the language, the technology, and the way of doing things.5

But economic explanations are not enough. That India adopted democracy in 1950 before capitalism (in 1991) is also significant because democracy's redistributive pressures, such as free power to farmers and other subsidies, have dampened growth and also explain why India's reform process has been so painfully slow. Economists also find it puzzling why the liberal institutions of the British Raj did not engender faster growth during the colonial years. The rule of law, the relative peace of Pax Brittanica, a non-dirigiste administration, the railways and canals—all these were market friendly moves, after all.

I believe that national confidence also plays an important role. The more damaging impact of colonialism may well have been to Indian minds—it created an inferiority complex from which they have only recently recovered. Douglass North has rightly emphasized the importance of beliefs.6Businessmen understand the value of confidence in entrepreneurial success and in creating a climate for investment; Historians too emphasize the power of self-belief in national success--Roman history and Britain's rise in the 19th century are examples of this. After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose, especially as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism damaged that confidence. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, confidence returned and young Indian minds finally became decolonized. I traveled extensively across India in the 1990's when I discovered this changed mood, and I think it also explains the current economic success.7

I shall now amplify my arguments by taking the reader on a galloping tour of Indian economic history. From this story I shall draw lessons about the role of institutions and culture in development. En passant, I shall touch upon the great questions of Indian history: did the British impoverish India? Why didn't the railways engender an industrial revolution? Did Nehru's socialism dampen India's progress? What is the consequence of democracy preceding capitalism?

Let's begin with the Mughals

India's nationalist historians have portrayed its pre-colonial economy as a golden age of prosperity, and this fabulous wealth set the Europeans on their great voyages of discovery.8 During the Mughal Empire at the end of the 16th century, India's wealth did indeed sustain more than 100 million people. With plenty of arable land, its agriculture was certainly as productive as Western Europe's, and even the subsistence-oriented peasant got a decent return.9 India also had a large, skilled workforce that produced not only cotton but also luxuries for the aristocracy. Consequently, the economy produced a large financial surplus, which was used to support the growing Mughal Empire and finance spectacular monuments like the Taj Mahal.10

In 1497, the Portuguese sent Vasco da Gama with a flotilla of four ships to find India's wealth. But the two-year voyage was not a commercial success and the Indians were not interested in European clothes and goods for they made far ones in India. But Da Gama told King Manuel of Portugal of large cities, large buildings and rivers, and great populations. He spoke about spices and jewels, precious stones and “mines of gold.” He believed that he had found India's legendary wealth.11

It took the English a hundred years to discover this wealth. Initially, they came to plunder but soon discovered the rewards of trade. They found that India produced the world's best cotton yarn and textiles and in enormous quantities.12 What the Indians wanted in exchange from the Europeans was gold and silver, for which they had an insatiable appetite. Hence, there was a constant flow of gold to India, which absorbed a good deal of the bullion mined by the Spaniards in the New World. Having learned about cotton textiles from India, the English turned the tables, and brought an industrial revolution to Britain, but destroyed the lives of millions of Indian weavers.

India was a leading manufacturer in the 18th century

India was a leading manufacturing country in the world in the early 18th century. It had 22.6 percent share of the world's GDP, which came down to around 16 percent by 1820, closer to its share of world population.13 It had a developed banking system and vigorous merchant capital, with a network of agents, brokers and middlemen. Given the enormous financial surplus, a skilled artisan class, large exports, plenty of arable land and reasonable productivity, the question is why didn't a modern industrial economy emerge in India? Instead, why did India become impoverished?

Despite a dynamic and a growing commercial sector which responded to market forces and extensive foreign trade, the truth is that 18th century India was significantly behind Western Europe in technology, institutions and ideas. Neither an agricultural revolution, nor a scientific revolution had occurred, and in the long run the manual skill of the Indian artisan could be no substitute for technological progress,”14 and this would have needed new attitudes. Notwithstanding the surplus and the trade, mid-eighteenth India had a “per capita product perhaps two-thirds of that in England and France.”15

There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor. One explanation is that even in the 18th century India had a large population and plenty of cheap labor. Prosperity comes with rising productivity and a rise in productivity depends on technology. When the supply of labor is elastic, it is more economical to hire people than to invest in machines. Hence, an Englishman observed in 1807, “In India it is seldom that an attempt is made to accomplish anything by machinery that can be performed by human labour.”16 There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor.

Did the British Raj impoverish India?

India's nationalist historians have blamed the British Raj for India's poverty. The classic nationalist case is that India had been rich before the British came and colonialism weakened agriculture and “deindustrialized” India, throwing millions of artisans out of work. Britain's trade policies encouraged the import of manufactures and the export of raw materials; finally, it drained the wealth of India by transferring its capital to Britain.

Nationalists claimed that Lancashire's new textile mills crushed India's handloom textile industry and threw millions of weavers out of work. India's textile exports plunged from a leadership position before the start of the Britain's Industrial Revolution to a fraction. The indigenous banking system, which financed these exports, was also destroyed. Since the colonial government did not erect tariff barriers, Indian consumers shifted to cheaper English mill-made cloth and millions of handloom workers where left in misery. British colonial rule “de-industrialised” India (a favorite nationalist phrase) and from an exporter of textiles, India became an exporter of raw cotton.17

Britain also changed the old land revenue system to the disadvantage of the farmer, who had to now pay revenue whether or not the monsoon failed. This led to famines. The worst one in 1896-97 affected 96 million lives and killed an estimated 5 million people. Although the railways helped in the trade of food crops, the enlarged national market sucked away the peasant's surplus, which he had earlier stored for the bad years. Moreover, the British government transferred its surplus revenues back to England. Since India consistently exported more then she imported in the second half of the 19th century and early 20th century, Britain used India's trade surplus to finance her own trade deficit with the rest of the world, to pay for her exports to India, and for capital repayments in London. This represented a massive drain of India's wealth.18

In recent years some historians have challenged this nationalist picture. They have argued that Indian industry's decline in the 19th century was caused by technology. The machines of Britain's industrial revolution wiped out Indian textiles, in the same way that traditional handmade textiles disappeared in Europe and the rest of the world. Fifty years later Indian textile mills would have destroyed them. India's weavers were, thus, the victims of technological obsolescence.19

They also found that the land tax had not been exorbitant—by 1900 it was only 5 percent of the agricultural output or half the average per capita tax burden. There had been a “drain of wealth”, but it was only about 1.5 percent of GNP every year. The revisionist historians argued that India's payments to Britain were for real military and civilian services and to service capital investments. Also, the overhead cost of the British establishment—the so called “home charges”—was in fact quite small.20 If India had its own army and navy it would have spent more. True, India did have a balance of payments surplus, which Britain used to finance part of her deficit, but India was compensated by the import of gold and silver that went into private Indian hands.

India begins to re-industrize

Indian entrepreneurs began to set up their own modern textile mills after 1850 and very slowly began to recapture the domestic market. In 1896, Indian mills supplied 8% of the total cloth consumed in India; in 1913, 20%; in 1936, 62%; and by 1945, 76%.21Although India did not participate in global trade expansion between 1870 and 1913, Indian businessmen made large profits during the First World War, which they reinvested in after the war. Thus, India's manufacturing output grew 5.6 percent per year between 1913-38, well above the world average of 3.3 percent.” 22 The British government finally provided tariff protection from the 1920s, which helped industrialists to expand and diversify.

By Independence in 1947, Indian entrepreneurs were strong and in a position to buy out the businesses of the departing British. Industry's share in India's GNP had doubled from 3.8 percent (in 1913) to 7.5 percent (in 1947), and the share of manufactures in her exports rose from 22.4 percent (in 1913) to 30 percent (in 1947).

Why didn't an industrial revolution occur?

One of the intriguing questions of history is why India failed to create an industrial revolution. Karl Marx predicted that the railways would transform India and usher in an industrial revolution. Indeed, by the First World War, some thought that it was ready to take-off. By 1914, India had the third largest railway network, the world's largest jute manufacturing industry, the fourth largest cotton textile industry, the largest canal system, and 2.5 percent of world trade.23Although a colony, it had a very liberal regulatory regime--far more investor friendly than the one that replaced it after Independence—and after the 1920s the infant industry was also favored by tariffs. It had a merchant class hungry to become industrialists. Industrialization did, in fact, pick up after the War and industry's share in national output doubled. But it was not enough to broadly transform an agricultural society. Modern industry employed only 2.5 million people out of population of 350 million.

Amiya Kumar Bagchi, the Marxist economist, suggests that the reason was the lack of effective demand during the colonial period, and this limited business opportunity. Indians were just too poor to buy modern goods and services.24 If the domestic Indian market was small, couldn't the entrepreneur have supplemented it by producing for export? Morris D. Morris, blames supply constraints.25 An Indian entrepreneur was uncompetitive because of a shortage of technology, skilled labor, and capital—all of which raised his cost of his production. The historian, Rajat Ray, argues that Indian businessmen did not export because they made inferior products, unacceptable to the world market. In his view, technological backwardness was the single biggest failing.26 But surely, they could have imported technology, as Jamshedji Tata, G.D. Birla, and others did.

Unlike nationalist historians, I do not think there was a British conspiracy to deliberately under-invest in India or sabotage Indian business interests. Bombay's textile mills were built with the credit, technical assistance and machines from Britain although they were a competitive threat to the Manchester's mills. I believe the industrial revolution did not occur because Indian agriculture remained stagnant, and you cannot have an industrial revolution without an agricultural surplus or the means to feed a rapidly growing urban population; second, the international trading environment turned hostile with protectionism after the First World War, followed by the Depression; third, the colonial government did not educate the masses, unlike the Japanese state; finally, a colonial mindset pervaded the Indian middle class--even the hardiest potential entrepreneur lacks confidence when he is politically enslaved.

What is the verdict on British rule?

Did the British impoverish India? There is no question that in the 18th century it plundered and looted India's wealth, as all conquerors have done in history. But did it create on-going institutions that were to India's detriment? This has to do with the nature and theory of colonialism. True, its Industrial Revolution threw millions of weavers out of work, but it would have happened any way when the new technology reached India. British government policy could have cushioned the impact by erecting trade barriers and saved enormous amount of human suffering, but protecting handlooms would have been a temporary palliative.

Odd as it may seem, I believe that Britain did not “exploit” India enough. Had it made the massive investments in India that it did in the Americas, India would have become more prosperous and a much bigger market for British goods. A richer India would have been a better customer, a better supplier, and a firmer basis of Empire.27 Britain's main failure was not to educate the Indian masses—hence 83 percent of Indians were illiterate at Independence. Britain's education system in India produced only a thin upper crust of extremely well educated Indians, while the masses remained illiterate.28

Although Britain could not lift Indians out of poverty, nor avert famines, it did give India the institutions of democracy--the rule of law, an independent judiciary and a free press. It built railways, canals, and harbors. It gave India almost a hundred years of peace—the Pax Britannica. Although it gave modern values and institutions, it did not interfere with its ancient traditions and religion. Hence, India has preserved its spiritual heritage and the old way of life continues. Many despair over the divisiveness of caste, but the hold of the Indian way of life is also a bulwark against the onslaught of the global culture.

Independence and 'License Raj'

After Independence, democracy took root in India and gradually the masses acquired a stake in the system, periodically electing representatives even from the lowest castes. The rulers also adopted a Fabian socialist economic path, and Indians did not turn to capitalism until 1991, although there was modest liberalization of the economy in the 1980s. Thus, India embraced democracy before capitalism, which makes its journey to modernity unique and explains a good deal.

Jawaharlal Nehru and his planners did not trust private entrepreneurs; so they made the state the entrepreneur, and not surprisingly, they failed to create an industrial revolution. Instead, India experienced an agricultural revolution in the early 1970s. It thus had an important pre-condition for the industrial revolution—an agricultural surplus—but the industrial take-off eluded it. Its investment rate also rose from 6 percent to well over 20 per cent, and yet it did not engender a take-off. Why?

I think there were at least six things wrong with India's mantra: one, it adopted an inward-looking, import-substituting path rather than an outward-looking, export-promoting route; it thus denied itself a share in world trade and the prosperity that trade brought in the post-War era. Two, it set up a massive, inefficient, and monopolistic public sector to which it denied autonomy of working; hence, its investments were not productive and it had a poor capital-output ratio. Three, it over-regulated private enterprise with the worst controls in the world, and this diminished competition in the market; four, it discouraged foreign capital and denied itself the benefits of technology and world class competition. Five, it pampered organized labor to the point that it has extremely low productivity. Six, it ignored the education of its children.

Nehru's strategic planner, P.C. Mahalanobis, made two wrong assumptions. He assumed that there were no opportunities for rapid export expansion in the 1950s, and this turned out to be wrong. India discovered that tiny Hong Kong could earn more from its exports than the whole of India, as India's share of world trade declined from 2.2 percent in 1947 to 0.5 percent in 1990. He also assumed that competition was wasteful, and this was also a flawed idea because there can be little improvement in productivity without it.

Even more damaging were the creeping controls on the private sector. The most bizarre was the licensing system. It began with the Industrial Licensing Act of 1951, which required an entrepreneur to get a license to set up a new unit, to expand it, or change the product mix. A huge number of untrained clerks, engineers, bureaucrats at the Directorate General of Technical Development, operating on the basis of inadequate information vetted thousands of applications on an ad hoc basis. These low level functionaries took months in the futile, micro-review of an application and finally sent it for approval to the administrative ministry. The ministry again lost months reviewing the same data before it sent the application to an inter-ministerial licensing committee. After the Minister's approval, the investor had to seek approval for the import of machinery from the capital goods licensing committee. If finance was needed from a State financial institution, the same scrutiny had to be repeated afresh. The result was enormous delays, sometimes lasting years with staggering opportunities for corruption.

Large business houses set up parallel bureaucracies in Delhi, to follow up on their files, organize bribes, and win licenses. If the entrepreneur did finally get started and made a success of his enterprise, he was again in trouble. It was an offence punishable under the law to manufacture beyond the capacity granted by the license. India became the only country in the world where the production of sorely needed goods sorely was punishable by law.29

The system ended in thwarting competition, entrepreneurship and growth, without achieving any of its social objectives. It fostered monopolies and it proliferated uneconomic-size plants in remote, uncompetitive locations, employing second-rate technology. Bureaucrats who did not have a clue about the basics of running a business made the decisions on the choice of technology, the size and location of plants.

Although it was becoming clear that India was on the wrong path by the late sixties, instead of changing course after Nehru, Indira Gandhi introduced more controls. She nationalized banks, discouraged foreign investment, and placed more hurdles before domestic enterprise. Hence, industrial growth plunged from 7.7 per cent a year between 1951-1965 to 4.0 per cent between 1966-1980. Productivity of Indian manufacturing declined half a percent a year from 1960 to 1985.30

“1966-1980 is effectively the dark period for the Indian economy.”31. It is harder to blame Nehru for adopting the economic wrong model for socialism was the wisdom of his age and dozens of economists visited India and hailed his bold experiment.32 It is right to blame Indira Gandhi, for by then Japan's miracle was evident, and Korea and Taiwan were following its footsteps. However, ideology is only one part of the story. An important reason for non-performance was poor implementation. Even Nehru's socialism could have delivered more and did not have to degenerate into “License Raj”.

India after the Reforms

Although there was modest liberalization in the 1980s, the decisive turning point came in July 1991 when the minority government of Narasimha Rao announced sweeping reforms. It opened the economy to foreign investment and trade; it dismantled import controls, lowered customs duties, devalued the currency and made the rupee convertible on the trade account; it virtually abolished licensing controls on private investment, dropped tax rates and broke public sector monopolies. As a result growth rose to 7.5 percent a year for three years in a row in the mid-nineties, inflation came down from 13 percent to 6 percent by 1993, exchange reserves shot up from $1 billion to $20 billion by 1993, and had crossed $100 billion by end 2003. This was as important a turning point as Deng's revolution in China in December 1978. Surprisingly, the elected coalition governments that succeeded Rao continued the reform process, and despite its slow, incremental pace, it has made India one of the fastest growing major economies in the world.33

Indians have traditionally not accorded a high place to making money. Hence, the merchant or bania is placed third in the four-caste hierarchy, behind the brahmin and the kshatriya, and only a step ahead of the laboring shudra. After the economic reforms making money became increasingly respectable and the sons of brahmins and kshatriyas began to get MBAs and wanted to become entrepreneurs. The business pages of newspapers became livelier; chief ministers in the states scrambled for private investment; judges became more even-handed in industrial disputes. As a result, India is in the midst of a social revolution rivalled, perhaps, only by the ascent of Japan's merchant class during the 1968 Meiji Restoration.

There has also been mental revolution. And a changed attitude to English illustrates this new mindset. Ever since the British left Indians constantly carped against the English language. But in the 1990s this carping seemed to die, and quietly, without ceremony English became one of the Indian languages. English lost its colonial stigma, oddly enough, around the time that the Hindu nationalists came to power. Young Indians in the new middle class think of English as a skill, like Windows. This is why Hinglish (Hindi mixed with English) is spreading. Encouraged by flourishing private television channels and supported by their advertisers, the newly emerging middle classes avidly embrace this uninhibited hybrid of Hindi and English, and this popular idiom of the bazaar is rushing down the socio-economic ladder. The purists naturally disapprove, but people are more comfortable and accepting of it today because Indians are more relaxed and confident as a people. Their minds have become decolonized.

The world, meanwhile, also changed from an industrial to the information economy, and it seemed to speak to India's advantage, symbolized by its success in software and business process outsourcing. These “Bangalores” have given Indians confidence and they reflect a new social contract. The new entrepreneurs did not inherit wealth; they have risen on the back of their talent, hard work, and professional skills. A new self-belief has emerged among urban youth that doesn't need approval from others, especially from the West. Music composers like A.R. Rehman display an exuberant nonchalance, as do the new young Bollywood pop stars. So do new fiction writers like Arundhati Roy, designers of fashion clothes, beauty queens and cricket stars.

Some lessons

Neoclassical economic theory explains a great deal about why the Indian economy that was stagnating in the first half of the 20th century went on to become one of the fastest growing by the end of the century. It tells us, for example, that disgraceful protectionism by governments in the inter-war years in the first half of the 20th century dampened world trade and slowed down the world and the Indian economies. It also explains why India performed below the world average between 1950-1980: thinking that trade had impoverished her in the colonial period, India closed its economy and denied itself the fruits of a “golden period” in world trade between 1950 and 1970; “License Raj” and other institutions of Nehru's socialism also suppressed growth. Finally, neoclassical economics explains how by dismantling controls and integrating the economy with the global economy, the Indian economy has become more competitive and is growing rapidly after the reforms.

But this is not the whole story, and we must turn to institutions and attitudes to understand the incentive structure of the Indian society.60 Indians blame colonialism for impoverishing them. But we have seen that colonialism is a more complex tale. For example, it did not 'de-industrialize' India as the nationalists argued; handloom textiles died in India (and the world) because of technological obsolescence. Colonialism's bigger damage was to the loss of Indian confidence, which inhibited Indian entrepreneurs. This confidence began to grow with Gandhi's freedom movement in the first half of the 20th century, and industrialization did pick up. However, its impact on society was insufficient to create an industrial revolution.

After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism acted as a damper. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, self-assurance returned to the Indian marketplace. Today's mood in India is opposite to what existed a hundred years ago. Insecurity and inferiority filled colonial India, which is all too apparent in the writings of Bengali writers of the 19th century, such as Bankim Chandra Chatterji. Today, writers like Salman Rushdie and Arundhati Roy exhibit a matter of fact assuredness (almost a cool) that is a reflection of changed national mindset.

India embraced democracy first and capitalism afterwards and this has made a difference. India became a full-fledged democracy in 1950, with universal suffrage and extensive human rights, but it was not until 1991 that it opened up to the free play of market forces. For the rest of the world it has been the other way around. In the West, suffrage was extended gradually in the last century, and as mass political parties developed, democracy began to impinge on capitalist institutions and practices.

India's democracy has an overwhelming majority of poor voters--70 per cent still live in rural areas; organized labor constitutes less than 10 per cent of total labor; and the middle class is around 20 per cent of the population. Because of democratic pressures, India tried to redistribute the pie before it was baked. It set up intricate regulatory networks before the private economy had transformed a rural into an industrial society. It began to think in terms of “welfare” before there were welfare-generating jobs. The result, as we have seen, was a throttling of enterprise, slow growth, and missed opportunities. It is the price India has paid for having democracy before capitalism—or rather too much democracy and not enough capitalism.

Since politics is a short run game and growth is a long run one there will never be a situation that is completely optimal. This explains why Indian politicians do not bother about education because results take a long time to come. When a politician promises rice for two rupees a kilo when it costs five rupees in the market, he wins the election. Since the mid-1960s politicians have vigorously competed in giving away free goods and services to voters. When politicians do that, where is the money to come for creating schools or improving old ones? India's damaging fiscal deficit (around 10 percent of GDP for the center and states combined) is a testimonial to the downside of competitive politics, and it teaches that the demand for publicly provided goods and services is insatiable in a democracy.

But India's problems of governance go far beyond the need to appease interests. The weakening of its democratic institutions since Indira Gandhi in the 1970s has caused widespread corruption, political violence, populist giveaways, and a paralysis of problem solving. Conspicuously absent are disciplined party organizations, which help leaders in other democracies to mobilize support for specific programs. Hence, there is an excessive reliance on the personal appeal of individual leaders to win elections. When in power leaders tend to take the easy way out, which is not to act at all.

Will capitalism, and its cousin globalization succeed in establishing a comfortable place for themselves in India? The answer depends on their ability to deliver prosperity broadly. It also depends on leaders in the government and in business to champion the classic liberal premises of free trade and competition. It needs leaders to come out say that (1) some people will not fare as well in the competitive market place; (2) the winners will far outnumber the losers; (2) capitalist democracy is the best arrangement we have found; (4) globalization is not only a good thing, it is a great leap forward in history. My fear is that capitalism's success in India is threatened not so much by the leftists or protectionists but by the timidity of its defenders.

The curious historic inversion between democracy and capitalism means that India's path into the future is evolving through a daily dialogue between the conservative forces of caste, religion and the village, the leftist and Nehruvian socialist forces which dominated the intellectual life of the country for 40 years, and the new forces of global capitalism. These “million negotiations of democracy” slow down the pace of economic reforms, but they also mean that India might have a more stable, peaceful, and negotiated transition into the future than say China. It might also avoid some of the deleterious side effects of an unprepared capitalist society, such as Russia. Although slower, India is more likely to preserve its way of life and it's civilization of diversity, tolerance, and spirituality against the onslaught of the global culture.

Does culture matter?

Cultural explanations have been a vigorous industry in India for more than a hundred years. Colonial officials routinely blamed India's poverty on the otherworldly spirituality of Hindu life and its fatalistic beliefs. Max Weber attributed the absence of development to the caste system. Gunnar Myrdal, the Swedish economist, found that India's social system and attitudes were an important cause of its “low level equilibrium” of low productivity, primitive production techniques, and low levels of living.34

Deepak Lal, another economist, similarly explained economic stagnation in a low level “Hindu equilibrium” around the caste system, which bought stability in the context of political warfare, monsoon failure and climatic uncertainty, labor shortage, and an under-valued merchant class.35 David Landes, the historian, blames the enervating heat, which is deleterious to work. For this reason, rich countries lie in temperate zones and the poor in the tropics and semi-tropics.36

While institutions and culture do matter undoubtedly, we are all skeptical of national stereotypes and easy cultural explanations of the sort that were common hundred years ago. In my experience, successful Hindu entrepreneurs can be both extremely otherworldly in religion and aggressive in business. The Indian farmer, despite being caught in the caste system, responds quickly to market based incentives, as the Green Revolution testifies. Brahmins, who are supposed to have contempt for manual labor, will plough their land vigorously if they have to. And Rajput Thakurs, who never worked for a living, will shed their feudal ways for the sake of a commercial opportunity. Moreover, there are substantial non-Hindus in India and these communities had also been stuck in the same rut of stagnation. Other Asian countries were equally backward, but they had no “Hindu equilibrium” to explain away their stagnation. Finally, the same Indians when they migrate to other countries perform better.

Thus, I am uncomfortable with the “otherworldly values of the Hindus” or the “immobilizing effects of the caste system” and the “conservative habits of the merchant caste”. I believe that Sir John Hicks' Economic Principle does trump in most cases. It states that “people would act economically; when the opportunity of an advantage was presented to them they would take it.”37 It explains not only the diffusion of the Green Revolution across India but also the demographic transitions currently underway in many states.

When seeking an explanation for a nation's wealth and poverty, my preferred method is to begin with economic factors as proximate causes that motivate a businessman to invest--the size of the market, the capability of suppliers, distribution hurdles, and the state of competition. If this does not satisfy, I seek answers in institutions, some of which are, of course, intimately tied to culture. I have found that institutions can evolve rapidly as incentives change in society and can be transferred fairly quickly; for example, during the 1990s India was able to dismantle many of the institutions of Nehruvian socialism and replace them with capitalist institutions. Finally, if none of these factors provide a satisfactory explanation, then I turn to attitudes and social structure.

I find Deepak Lall's distinction between material and cosmological beliefs useful.38The material beliefs of a civilization are about ways of making a living and are the subject of economics; cosmological ones are about how to live and are in the realm of 'culture'. The rise of the west was accompanied by a change in both sets of beliefs, but East Asia's success has needed mainly a change in material beliefs—it has become prosperous without losing its soul. In other words, it is possible to modernize without westernizing. Ever since the British Raj material beliefs have been changing in India unlike our cosmological beliefs.

Our continuing inability to distinguish between the “modern” and the “western” in India is surely the cause of some of our grief. If we could only accept that a great deal of modern western culture, especially its material beliefs, are not the West's property, but are a universal, critical way of thinking, which belongs to all rational human beings. We would not waste our energies on swadeshi (protectionism) hindutva (preserving the ancient Hindu civilization), and futile language debates (“remove English from primary schools”). The debate between modernisation and westernisation, begun in early nineteenth century by Ram Mohan Roy, continues to rage in India. At the root is a fear of the loss of the Indian way of life. The older generation fears it more than the young, whose minds are more decolonised and who are more confident in adopting the West's material beliefs without fearing the loss in its cosmological ones.

They didn't have to worry that just because they are ok with guys touching them to help them climb and stay in place they are going to be judged as being ""open to be touched"".

They didn't have to worry that just because their tops might be a bit out of place every now and then, they are going to be slut-shamed and be judged as ""available"".

And since it was such a healthy atmosphere the girls were wholeheartedly participating and enjoying themselves as equals.

"Quora is full of hate !! Quora used to be my favorite platform back in 2014, mainly because there was so much new to learn and only those people were answering who actually had knowledge regarding the topic ( Professors, Scientists, Military Historians )

Now, it's full of hate speech, low-quality answers and cringeworthy questions like - ""What are some destruction level 100 tweets"" or ""What are some badass tweets during Covid-19"". It's filled with young Indians who have zero knowledge about the topic but don't hesitate to write their senseless opinions and comment hate. 

What's worse is the fact that a lot of people are openly spreading religious hate and trying to influence others regarding their beliefs. There are many right and left wingers who blame each other with childish comments.  Civil debates are non-existent and right-wing always finds a chance to blame non-Hindus and Liberals in almost every problem. 

My personal experience : 1) A guy literally wrote an answer saying Italians are victims of Coronavirus because they are liberals. A commentor on same answer even wrote that Italians deserve the suffering because ""they are leftists"". Both of them were Indians.

2) Many questions criticizing the government are quickly reported. Then those who don't agree with government's stance are put down as ""secular liberals"". 

3) One guy literally posted tweets from BJP Trolls in his answer and called them 'epic burn' and 'badass'. 

4)  Multiple answers ""completely"" blaming Muslims for Coronavirus ( Tablighi Jamaat should be blamed 100% but not the whole religion )

"The protests are not against the inclusion of prosecuted minorities from Pakistan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan or to make CAA pro-Muslim This is the official line from BJP including their ministers, IT Cell and supporters to paint the protest as cruel against the plight of suffering of minorities from our neighbors (Pak+BD+Afg). This has been repeated by Amit Shah, Narendra Modi and extensively on social media by IT cell. They even released a [video from 2003 of Dr. Manmohan Singh](https://twitter.com/BJP4India/status/1207542398282162177/video/1) and have invoked [everyone from Mahatma Gandhi to Jawahar Lal Nehru to Rajiv Gandhi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Vu4-foePyc) for justifying the existence of  CAB and then CAA.


As is with all things BJP this cannot be further from the truth, even without considering the upcoming NRC and NPR, CAA is a pure BJP propaganda at its best. Except for Assam maybe who are against all refugees majority of India is protesting for very different reasons.

This bill now a law should be opposed by every Indian because it is establishes religion as a basis of citizenship and excluding one particular religion from it. By doing that it destroys the very thing that makes us different and frankly much better than countries like Pakistan, Saudi or any other country which give preferential treatment to one religion over another. The very thing strictly prohibited by [Article 14 of our constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_14_of_the_Constitution_of_India). It goes directly against it.

It is also worth mentioning that wording of the clauses in the bill as explained in the RS and LS is completely different from the bill which was actually passed. In all it's six clauses it makes no mention of 'prosecuted minority' or religion but simply refers to them as community. Henceforth excluding all but one community which seems to be the goal all along.

And lastly if government is so sure of their effort being noble and genuine why are they clamping down on every effort to protest it. If you're just and right let the public debate and truth will come out. As the official motto of our nation says सत्यमेव जयते|

This is all without adding it with NRC, once the act is coupled together it becomes clear what the real intention of this government has been all along. To demonize, de-franchise an entire community which has been prolific part of this land since the independence.

This is why each and everyone of us should fight against this fascist law which reeks of Nazi Germany and if you're one those who are happy that Muslims are being ""shown their place"" then don't forget Jews weren't the only one who suffered under Hitler.

**Pandering To The Base**

Every politician does it. From the Donald in the US to Modi in India, it’s a political science lesson that crosses borders. As much as we parade the “developing-nation” tag around, India’s economy is still heavily dependant on agriculture as it employs almost two-thirds of the nation’s people. And these farmers also constitute Modi’s base and naturally, his government needs to pander to them before the forth-coming state elections. After a union budget that was largely seen as pro-farmer by earmarking almost $826 million (₹5,524 crore) for crop insurance plans, the government might play two more cards to appease the backbone of the economy. One, officials said last week that they are considering imposing a [penalty](http://www.reuters.com/article/india-crop-insurance-idUSL3N16U22P) on delaying of claim settlements for crop insurance. That’s when you buy insurance and if the rains don’t come in and your crops fail, you get paid a settlement. Two, the government is likely to extend the the current 25% wheat import tax which expires in March to continue [beyond](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-wheat-duty-idINKCN0WN1H7) March. The tax was imposed to shield domestic wheat farmers from cheap imports. Wasn’t exactly effective since wheat output in 2015 was down 10% from 2014, despite the tax.


**The Great Indian Addiction**

Indian people are addicted. It’s not a drug, gambling or internet addiction. It’s an addiction to gold. Gold imports make up a quarter of India’s trade deficit because we import almost 10 lakh kgs of gold annually. Billionaire Warren Buffett says about gold: “It doesn’t do anything but sit there and look at you.”  Clearly, Indian people think that Buffett uncle doesn’t know anything about gold. Rehabilitating the Indian people from this addiction can be hard but the government is trying. Recently, it introduced a 1% excise duty on imported gold jewellry. How did that go down? Jewellers went on an indefinite strike which was called off last week after [assurances](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-gold-strike-idINKCN0WM01T) that excise department officials won’t harass jewellers. The government also started a campaign to monetize the privately owned horde of Indian gold to cut down on imports. How has that worked out? The scheme only managed to attract 0.015% of the estimated horde of gold that is currently in family lockers and temple vaults. There was some golden news on that front last week as the iconic 200-year-old [Siddhivinayak](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-gold-siddhihvinayak-temple-idINKCN0WK1ZF) temple in Mumbai announced its participation in the scheme.

**Because Karma Is A Bitch**

Petty sabotage and backstabbing isn’t just limited to undercover spies and Indian politics anymore. The corporates are adopting these strategies as well. Last week, Uber filed a lawsuit at the Delhi High Court against its biggest Indian competitor, Ola. The lawsuit accuses Ola of creating 90,000 fake Uber accounts and using them to book over 400,000 rides, only to be cancelled at the last [moment](http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/23/11292310/uber-ola-lawsuit-india-fake-rides-lyft). Classic prank by Ola, right? Except Uber claims that Ola did this to disrupt its operations and frustrate its drivers. And Uber would know that because it has been accused of doing the exact same thing to its biggest US competitor, Lyft. Two years ago, Lyft accused Uber of booking and cancelling over 5,000 rides using fake accounts that were traced back to Uber employees. If true, Ola will only have taken a page from Uber’s own playbook. If you’re a betting person, be sure to put your money on Uber - that company’s got deep pockets and can drag this out as long as it takes. It recently declared $1 billion (₹6,688 crore) in annual profits from it’s [top 30](http://www.newsweek.com/uber-profits-elsewhere-support-sustainable-spending-china-ceo-440705) cities alone. To be fair, they also said they were sustaining huge losses in China where the company holds a 30% market share.

**Auto Engines Are The New Moon Landing**

69th Richest Indian on the famous Forbes Rich-list and the co-founder of Infosys, Nandan Nilekani is known for investing in startups that focus on big, transformative ideas. In his investment portfolio is Team Indus, a company that aims to land a rover on the moon and Systemantics, a company that focuses on robots. Last week, Nilekani made his [biggest](http://thetechportal.in/2016/03/24/sedemac-mechatronics-funding/) startup investment yet in a company called Sedemac Mechatronics. What’s bigger than futuristic robots and landing on the moon? Time travel, perhaps? No, apparently, it’s building small engines and powertrains for auto companies. Nilekani led the latest round of funding in Sedemac which summed up to a total of $7.5 million (₹50 crore). Sedemac counts the big boys of the auto industry like Tata Motors, Mahindra Group, Ashok Leyland as its clients and was started by an engineering professor at IIT-B with a couple of fellow IITians.

**The Chinese Dragon Wants In On India**

The “Big Three” of e-commerce in India - Flipkart, Snapdeal and Amazon - will soon become the “Big Four” with the entry of Alibaba, the chinese e-commerce giant in India. Officials from the company that is poised to [surpass](http://www.businessinsider.in/Alibaba-on-course-to-become-worlds-top-retailer/articleshow/51507633.cms) the world’s biggest retailer, Walmart and claim that tag for itself, said last week that Alibaba was looking to expand its presence in India. It is looking to directly enter the online retail segment later this year. Run by China’s richest person, Jack Ma, the company already owns 40% of Paytm and 4% of Snapdeal. Are Indian e-commerce companies coming together like brothers-in-arms to fight off competition from this foreign entity? Of course no. The Indians didn’t unite when the British literally invaded and aren’t going to do that now with the Chinese either. In fact, Flipkart co-founder Sachin Bansal and his Snapdeal counterpart Kunal Bahl already found themselves in a war of words on [Twitter](http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/flipkart-s-sachin-bansal-takes-jibe-at-alibaba-s-india-entry-116032600040_1.html) over Alibaba’s planned expansion in India. Alibaba, which still conjures images of forty thieves in one’s imagination, may tie up with the [Tatas](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2016-03-21/news/71705366_1_digital-india-alibaba-group-chairman-cyrus-mistry) to launch its online retail business as a joint-venture. This is because FDI regulations still don’t allow foreign companies to sell directly to Indian consumers, which is what Alibaba wants to do. Amazon, the US ambassador to the industry, merely connects buyers and sellers and doesn’t sell itself.

**Oli Gets Oil**

Nepal’s Prime Minister K. P. Sharma Oli recently took a trip up north to Beijing and stumbled his way into signing an agreement with China for the supply of petroleum products to [Nepal](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-nepal-idUSKCN0WP1WV). The country, which serves as a strategic buffer between India and China, adopted its first post-monarchy constitution last year. But protesters opposing the new constitution blocked trucks carrying fuel and essential goods coming from India. This five-month long “unofficial blockade” of Nepal had disastrous consequences for the Nepalese economy due to its overwhelming dependence on India. The distraught country says it now wants to import 33% of Nepal’s fuel from China in the future. Basically, after being deeply hurt by what the Indians did, Nepal is now looking for some quick rebound action from the Chinese. Indian officials, however, are far from alarmed that Nepal is trying to move away from the Indian sphere of influence. Why? Because there is this big huge chunk of rock called the Himalayas between Nepal and China.

"Is ""VPK"" an Indian name? Or some kind of abbreviation? I am a legal assistant in the United States. I encounter names from all over the world, and sometimes there are interesting name conventions that are uncommon or obscure in the US.

Recently, I encountered what looks like a three-part name, the last 'name' being ""VPK"". (We see most names in all caps.)

It is unclear to us if this ""VPK"" is an actual name, or instead some kind of post-nominal abbreviation. (In the manner of ""Jr."", for example.)

""VPK"" already seems unlikely as **any** name, since it has no vowels (How would it be pronounced), but is also much shorter than most other Indian names I have ever encountered. I have a hard time believing this is someone's name.

It seems more likely to me that it's some kind of abbreviation, but after spending a lot of time trying to find out, I'm at a loss. It might even be a special Indian or South Asian legal expression, perhaps indicating marital or other status.

Can anyone here shed any light on this? Thank you so much.",AskIndia

"Serious: Advice with employer 'Show Cause Notice' My sister has been working in a really hostile and negative work environment for over a year in Mumbai. Her boss has screamed at her in front of her colleagues and a senior manager has made several sexual advances that she has avoided. Recently she got employed at another location and put in her resignation to serve her notice period.

As soon as she put in her notice, the company executives sent her a 'Show Cause Notice.' In my opinion the 'show cause' notice does not have any concrete evidence to support any of the claims the management has made to terminate her. By concrete I mean, an email or an audio/video recording that is supporting evidence. It's all hearsay stuff. Here is a snapshot of what they wrote in the notice:

*""It has been brought to our notice that you have engaged in inappropriate behavior at the workplace, following concerns have been highlighted:*

*- Inappropriate and unwarranted discussions with colleagues to defame and demean your supervisor,*

*- Impacting the overall wellbeing of the department by creating a negative and hostile environment,*

*- unprofessional behavior as a team member.""*

My sister is really stressed  and does not know what to do. She has to respond to the notice.

"Who do you think is right in #LogOut campaign? Zomato or Restaurant owners? The #LogOut campaign has been raising eyebrows as the uprising of restaurants against food aggregators who are technically not bound by what restaurants on their platforms say. More on the campaign [here](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/restaurants-decide-to-pull-out-of-dining-apps-that-offer-deals-1565792728714.html)

So for those who haven't heard about it, the restaurants via their association ""National Restaurants Association of India""(NRAI) have broadly faced following issues.

1) The zomato gold deep discounting system is hurting their business since people misuse it by for example, on a weekend, get 1+1 on drinks at one place and then grab 1+1 on food at another place. This unarguably has hut the owner's pockets

2) Lack of transparency from Zomato on their rating system and the fact that Zomato provide details of customers using which Restaurants can build a loyal customer base.

3) Large chains like Domino's and McD are able to negotiate huge bargain on commissions(7-8%) while small restaurants have to agree to around 20-25% to even be visible on the platform. This doesn't include the hefty advertising fee. Hence, no uniform policy and systematic abuse of MSME eateries.

Now, these may seem like business decisions on part of Zomato to become profitable. Still, they have agreed to tweak Gold program, rather unfairly to us as customers. More on that [here](https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/zomato-rejigs-gold-service-to-benefit-restaurants-ceo-1566402560626.html)

Yesterday, Zomato Co-founder and CEO engaged in below the belt fights and said they were done with this campaign.

So, who do you think is right in their stand?

"India celebrating a new festival or it’s just a distraction? As most of the Indians are switching off their lights at 9p.m. on 5th April we really need to ask the question is this a new festival is it required or it is just a new method of distracting people’s attention from more severe question?

Our Government is a master in distracting people from the tel question, is this the same. As I see people celebrating this moment and not asking about the real question here why are we doing this? I asked my family members and some friends they all said it’s a Mini Diwali. Today lord Ram killed the Meghanath so we all are celebrating. 

Well that’s funny isn’t it? In my personal opinion this moment is just used to distract people coz in recent 3 to 4 days the daily new COVOD19 cases are more than 500+. And reports are emerging from across the India that doctors don’t have enough PPE they are not being treated well by the officials and the people they are treating. Some media houses is saying that government is not providing reliable data on the no of cases and the measures taken by them to tackle Coronavirus. Also the reason behind the new fund PM Cares is also not clear as the PM relief fund already has more than 3,400+ Cr. Rupees. And how government is using the money from PM Cares. These are just small questions which we really do need to ask from the government and they don’t want to answer that. 

So,  we really need to ask is that is this was really necessary or it’s just a new propaganda by government to hide its tracks like previous many. 
I’m not saying this is bad or you shouldn’t do it I’m saying we really need to focus on the real problem which is coronavirus in this case. Celebrate and ask.

"Can someone shed some perspective on the movie Arjun Reddy's fame? SPOILERS ALERT. DON'T READ IF YOU HAVE NOT WATCHED ARJUN REDDY AND PLAN TO WATCH IT

I recently watched the movie on prime. It's probably the only other telugu movie I've watched since Bahubali. And safe to say, I'm traumatized. 

He is an abuser. In the name of anger, he almost rapes a girl in the beginning. He threatens her at knife point. He almost throws a flower pot at the lead's sister. The way he lashes in anger at his girlfriend and everyone else and never apologizes is shocking. 

The girl is controlled. Right from the moment she steps into the college, he controls who she can speak with. He gives advice along the lines of ""make a fat friend so you get noticed more"" (He also scolds someone else for OBJECTIFYING WOMEN????) Okay, they get into a relationship properly. But then, all I know about Preethi is that she loves Arjun Reddy. That's all. That's all is there to her character. 

After he whores around whilst having a broken heart, he is forgiven, his anger issues are not tackled, he gets back with the girl, and they live happily ever after???  A fitting end would have been his downfall, as it should be. 

The abuse was handled so so so so so badly. He recovers in a day??? He does as he pleases, goes to no therapy, and everything is okay because he is brilliant? 

Also, the blatant casteism.  ""I curse you to marry a Tulu guy"",  just because what he wanted didn't happen? "" I will make her mine"".  That is not love. That is a sign of a disturbed, controlling, abusive guy. He needs jail or therapy.

Okay, apparently this movie has shown kissing and pre marital sex and is ""PROGRESSIVE"". BUT IT IS SO GODDAMN painful to watch. I cannot stand the abuse. The moment he went all "" pants only, no need of top"" in the beginning, I felt it. What the hell is this script? 

And why is such behavior NORMALISED in the name of LOVE of all things? 

Can someone shed some perspective on why this crap is being remade in hindi????",AskIndia

I can't find good 3 ton ac in any brand. Few available don't have any star ratings.

"Pitting a community against a political party is fucking stupid. First of all let me start by saying it was stupid whatever some muslims did at nizamuddin and still are doing by staying hidden and not letting the authorities do their work efficiently. 

But this rant is not just about this situation, it is about people's ignorance and lack of knowledge, people don't understand what is propoganda, and they don't know there history either and they continue to pit up a communuty against a political party. No BJP does not represent Hindus all it represents are the hindu extremists, so when i say fuck bjp, it means, fuck the politicians who are making this country burn. Bjp is the only party who has reached new heights and depths of instigating people to turn on each other, and paint muslims as someone who are gonna attack hindus for no reason. Regardless of what people want, a political party's job is to maintain communal harmony in a democratic country. What part of this people don't undertstand ? and why are dalits even supporting BJP's assholes, they beat up dalits, discriminate against them, all bjp is trying to do is keep brahmin supremacy in this country. Everyone is crazy about religion, i say fuck religion, if you believe in a higher power that is cool i don't care but killing in the name of god, fuck no.

"February Goals >>>>>>>> February Goals

It's been a little late for me to make resolutions for this year but we live in present and not past.

I think we all have the ability and audacity to think good and even exceptional things for ourselves. And I've learnt two things in life till now: whatever your goals are, let people know about it. It does two things: Firstly, people around you will help out and the secondly it will make you committed / liable.

So here it is:

Since I'm into public accounting and auditing, I've set a goal for myself to work with one of the big4 (**Deloitte, EY, PWC and KPMG**) in second half of 2020. 

For me it's a big deal to be a part of multinational and reputed accounting firms around the world. And I think it also serves a justice to my degrees as well.

So I've mapped out a plan which will help me in achievement of my goal. 

1. Everyday I would try to connect and speak with at least 1 recruiter and 3 people who are/were associate with those companies.
2. I will have my CV made from someone professional and experienced in this industry.
3. I will attend as many as networking events as possible and recite the same thing again to every person I come across in the hope of getting a connection somehow.
4. Try to schedule informational interviews if that's a thing in Dubai.
5. Make a professional video about my profile and upload it over social media.
6. Even I'll go one step further, upload all those networking and informational interviews videos on Youtube.
7. Maybe even run my Facebook and instagram ads against people who work in these organizations.
8. Last but not the least, prepare for that final day, EVERY SINGLE FUCKING DAY.

Now that would be it from my side and I'll leave out rest things on LUCK. 

Three things gonna happen from this post:

1. No-one responds (which is intact even worse) and I'll get on to my to-do list and check off every item listed above.
2. Someone who actually care about helping others and either work in these organisations or know someone there who can make things move would reach out to me.
3. And last one would be ones who will rant about everything.

Or just help me out on how to meet people and network with people over here in this part of the world? Coz I really want this thing man.",Scheduled

"My experience with the answers of Quora on Government Before 2014 I was a daily user of quora but once they started there selfless work of promoting government for each and everything and when the crowd of wannabe top writer started throwing senseless answers on stupid question after taking weed. I was forced to quit. But I didn't unsubscribe from Quora digest.

Every alternate week I see there is a question on work related to government in Quora digest. And despite knowing what kind of answer it is going to have 7 out of 10 times, I try to read that. 
I have seen it all from giving them a little bit of time to proving how good demonetization was. 

There is usually a pattern in answers if the question is normal one like, how Modi is performing in his constituency then typically top response have this pattern. 
First, he will put a discloser why he eligible for giving this answer it could be, the writer himself belongs to the same constituency to he visited this place twice, one before 2014 and one after 2014. After that discloser,  couple of pictures from Varanasi in the night from the perfect angle where you can't see the filth. And with that, he will assure you that   Varanasi is literally transformed into a world-class city. Despite the well-known fact that Varanasi is not just restricted to Ghats of Ganga rest of the answer will focus on that, and there will be a rosy picture in front of you. The list put in front of you will mostly a daily news article like Modi gave a gift of x crore to Varanasi and there was a project that started only by great leader etc. Now, what would you expect from a guy who lives there is to put a picture of how his life is changed like electricity, roads and healthcare facility, he is getting after 2014, but no I will throw every random project news about Varanasi without the follow up on that project. Are bahi! ager news article ki project started or gifted vali news headline hi padhni thi to question kyu puchta. 

Another instance if the question is about the health of the economy or something like demonetization. Where people are vocal means, there is less excuse to make. Then ignoring all the facts on how government changed his stance from the attack on black money to increasing cashless transaction. The writer will simply put forward his own theory or a new theory produced by Sir Sambit Patra. One of the theory was now the government have a big database of people who submitted their money it will be easy peasy Japanesey to find defaulters. In the end, there will be some statement from hotshot banking firm head backing their theory and proving how India is headed toward glorious future. Despite the well-known fact how crores of money renewed through bank staff as well as through traveling agencies, daily wage workers, and jan dhan account.  

There are some instances where they pull legs on failed policies like make in India and poor river health but don't know how they forget the name of our beloved PM and his party in that answer. It's all about how bad Indian citizen then. If river Ganga is still filthy then only people are responsible about that because they throw religious material in it. But they closed eyes when Mr. Modi along with his fellas dropped religious stuff in the river during the live telecast of Narmada dam inauguration. 

Justification on how it is just cow cow and cow everywhere is simply it is not new, and it is going on from ages. It was Nehru who started all this. And our beloved leader is so good he never question his elders work. Then why would he question work of Chacha Nehru? He is just following his footstep.

Justification on why farmers are dying and rape is a big problem is again it is not new, and the X country is actually a top-ranked country in this. Just don't dare to question our leader.
One of the top writer and flag bearer of Indian diaspora on Quora said something amazing when asked why they act like the lawyer of government. 

> For the same reason Sachin, Steve Jobs and a variety of people are staunchly defended by their fans. You might not have agreed with every one of Sachin’s shots [especially the silly shots he got out] but would desert him for that?
Modi was elected by crores of voters. Some of these might have voted because they thought there is no alternative. But, there is a sizeable chunk of voters who voted because they believed. They believe this government is theirs and not some random entity like we have often behaved in the past.
If you assume Modi’s string of victories in state elections is a fluke and that a sizeable chunk of people don’t truly adore him, you don’t understand the evolving Indian politics.
In a way this is democracy - where people feel ownership in the government. Look at US politics and the same happens - where common people feel ownership and stake in politics and fight for their ideology.
When you believe it is yours, you will fight for it. 

Yeah, I will fight for it, and I will fight for every single penny I gave through tax and different types of cess. And question government why things don't change instead of supporting them for each and every idiotic move.",Policy/Economy

"Masala Box Review Hi All,

I tried Masala Box for 5 days. North Indian Veg for Dinner. I stay in Mahadevpura around 2-3km from Bagamane World Technology Center. Now I subscribed through the app for the classic North Indian Veg dinner.

I am just letting everyone else know of my experience:-

The food arrived at around 8-9pm on all days, I didn't ask for a specific time nor did they, not sure if you can specify the time of delivery.

The delivery guy has a ton of parcels so you have to go get it, no door delivery :(

The food comes neatly packaged in a plastic container with 2 compartments for Daal, Sabji, 2 Chapatis &amp; Rice or Just Rice(1 day only), Raita, Salad, pickle. (If you choose South Indian you get curd, I didn't find any option to change from Raita to curd in the app)

Now the food seemed healthy with Salad **BUT the food was COLD** like always cold cold, never warm never ever. The Masala Box Customer care people requested for feedback the next day I informed them regarding my suggestion of using traditional steal dabbas rather than the throwaway plastic and also **please deliver the food hot**

And for the remaining 4 days, I ate the cold cold food. I have no idea if the food can be reheated in a microwave in the plastic throwaway plate/container they give.

Considering the price you pay I really want my food hot. For people thinking of going for masala box please go for the 5 days meal to see if it's going to work out for you.

For me, it just didn't workout...

EDIT:

Forgot the most important bit, not sure if I am a heavy eater or something but the food quantity was not sufficient as well. 2 chapatis and rice they provided was okay for me, I won't say was sufficient or more than enough, not sure about others.

EDIT:

By **Salad** I mean some carrots+cucumber or onion+radish or watermelon+cucumber pieces in a small box, please don't misunderstand it for the fancy salads with dozens of sauces/dressings

The amount I paid for 5 days was Rs.675 I think, the daal had a mix of sprouts or some veggies depending on the day, the dry vegetable was not repeated.

The per-meal cost comes down based on the number of days, For example, the cost for 30 days is Rs. 3000 (100 per meal). If you take the monthly plan you get 30 meals with a validity of 50 days as in you can choose which days you want the meal to be delivered within those 50 days.

**Note**

The aim of this post was not to bash or malign any tiffin service but just my personal opinion about the service, let people know about how things were since I could not find many reviews related to the service.

The website seems down I guess posting the review on Reddit really gave the site a heck of a lot of attention! :P",Food

"What is the Future of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in INDIA?  

A news report published in October in The Economic Times said, “Start-ups witness 108% growth in funding in India in 2018.” The news report further mentioned that Artificial Intelligence was among those domains which witnessed the fastest adoption among industry sectors. **Currently, there are about 400 start-ups working on AI and machine learning domains. About $150 million dollars is invested in India’s AI sector by private players alone and the number has been growing since 2016**. Though there has been growth, India lags far behind countries like the US and China in terms of investment. With a copious pool of STEM talent and with a growing population of youngsters, India will be banking on AI for its economic growth and improvement in the quality of life of its citizens.

There are several start-ups that are based in cities such as Bengaluru, New Delhi, Mumbai and Hyderabad which work on artificial intelligence principles to serve consumers better. Their product range varies from multi-lingual chatbots to online shopping assistance and automated consumer data analysis

&#x200B;

[Source- Belong](https://preview.redd.it/5qz6wrviz6d31.png?width=536&format=png&auto=webp&s=709e48183708ea32d16c66286c57beab08720676)

&#x200B;

* **THE ROAD AHEAD**

The National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence which was put together by the government of India through NITI Aayog sets the roadmap on how to develop AI in the country. The report points out how AI will help the country grow, what are the strengths and what are the challenges on the way. The government has identified a few areas where it thinks AI will play a crucial role as far as India is concerned

 

Capital and qualified manpower are the two main pillars that are required for the establishment and growth of any sector. India is home to a large talent pool of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math graduates. Companies such as Google, Intel and Microsoft have been offering short term training programs to computer program developers which help them upskill in the area of AI programming. On the other hand AICTE, the government body which governs and regulates professional education in India, recently added AI, IoT, Machine Learning and few other subjects as mandatory subjects in its curriculum of B.Tech programs. Changes in curriculum and content are further expected in the days to come.

Investment towards AI from private players has been increasing in India ($44 million in 2016 to $77 million in 2017). The start-ups have been working towards developing various AI-based products and services. With conglomerates having a lion’s share in India’s market, there is huge scope for AI-based enterprise solutions in the country. The increasing demand for products and services can attract more investment towards R&D in AI sector

"My thoughts regarding pubg addiction Guys pls read full comment and then comment if u think I am wrong and feel free to reply


- Who am I?

I am M 18, A pubg player who used to play pubg for like 4 hours a day from season 1 ( A few days after the game was launched ). U may say I was addicted to pubg.

- Do I still play pubg?

Yes I still do play pubg. But not everyday. I play it very less than before. I only play if my friend msg me if we should play pubg at a particular time. If both of us are free at same time and willing to play then we play else no one plays ( or plays for like 10 mins )

- How did I reduce my time spent on pubg?

1. Glitch and bugs like 1 tap glitch and car glitch and lag in general made me feel that I should not play

2. My friends also felt the same. I used to play most games with my friends because I felt playing with random wasn't as much fun. So we all started to play less


- Why do people commit suicide?

Firstly we are notified of serious incidents like suicide / murder but ""pubg"" should have also destroyed many relationships/ friendships

Personally I do not think that pubg alone can lead to such sad incidents.
The person had no one to speak freely with. No one would listen. Maybe peer pressure made him frustrated. Maybe parents instead of helping, taunted the child. Maybe the society made fun of the person. All the saturated anger/depression was the actual reason. Maybe the person thought that the way the escape everyday boring life was playing and playing pubg.

- Is playing online games to take our anger good?

Yes as well as no. You may feel good after you scream at usually random people but you may also feel more frustrated if they all are against you and u aren't so good in game. In such cases it is a very bad choice

- Have I faced similar situation and what did I do?

Yes even I play online games to take out my anger and sometimes get even more angry.
I just quit the game and start watching some anime I like ( sports anime works the best for me ). Going out for playing or short walks or talking with friends or playing with pets should be better options but many times we can't do it. People should find what works best for them and do it and relax


- Are parents responsible for such incidents?

I can't directly say if someone is responsible.
But parents should help the child. 


- My suggestions to parents:

1. Please don't bring the topic about how the current generation is addicted to phones and pubg and u were like �� x better. It irratates and makes all of us angry. Because ur generation has ruined every single thing. Most of us don't have land to play. Many are forced to compete for marks even when they aren't ready. Ur generation invented phone. School/College and tuition leave very less time to just chill and enjoy.
2. Talk to children like a friend
3. If you notice significant change then pls ask someone for help",Science/Technology

"Shit getting real, y'all: a rant I'm a doctor working in a large govt medical college and hospital.

To the best of my knowledge and assessment of the situation, we're about to get deluged in a wave of cases for which it is impossible to be adequately prepared. Many will die. The govt is trying, but whatever they arrange will never be enough for the general population to get off lightly. 

People panic buying food and medical supplies have created a vicious cycle so much so that I doubt if there will be enough meds for the frontline workers. This could potentially lead to more deaths in the healthcare workers, that could secondarily translate to a higher death rate in the patients.

People not taking quarantine seriously. Their actions today will kill many. Mostly their old, young, and sick family members, neighbours, or roommates.

In the meantime there's talk of having us work in makeshift corona wards from where we won't be able to return home. We'll probably stay on campus in recently emptied undergrad hostels. 

I don't mind working on campus and not coming home for weeks, maybe months. I don't mind dying too much either. ( I'm not super high-risk comorbidity-wise. I'm young. I run. But the stress is making me relapse into my smoking habit, and who knows what that might mean with this infection!) But the one thing that scares me shitless is that I don't know who will take care of my dogs at home. 

I hope I'm proved wrong in the coming weeks.

To negate the fatalism, if you're inside, avoiding ALL outside contact, you'll probably be able to delay infection to such time when we'll be better prepared to fight this thing with real world patient data, maybe new meds or even vaccines. Also death rates are generally low for young and fit patients.",Food

As the main driving force for me is , as long as I can test for the purity of water , food , etc I can determine why these essentials are contaminated and how to improve the quality or find less harmful alternatives. The first step to solving a problem is acknowledging there is a problem to start with. The vegetables and fruits we eat are laden with heavy metals , ripening agents , excess fertilizers , pesticides which we unknowingly consume on a daily basis.

"Zomato rider delivered the order but zomato is still levying cancellation charges even though i paid for it On 8 the june 2019, i had placed an order through zomato app from burger king using cod option for which i made full payment to the delivery boy who delivered me the burgers. As i was about to eat,  zomato' personnel contacted me and said that you had ordered twice so do you wish to receive the second order too to which i replied saying that i had ordered only once and had recieved it too...so he told me if you have any problem contact through email or chat support. So the second order was cancelled and now cancellation charges are levied.
Every time i call them, or use chat support or send them an email they keep telling their policy that if order is cancelled,cancellation charges can't be removed.
They didn't even cross check from burger king or check call records of their delivery boy as to whether i actually received it or not.
No acknowledgement is sent to me in respect of the order i paid for..only the cancelled order is shown in the order section of their app.
Also, Their delivery boy is lying..he gave me the order.. took the money but didn't update the order status..
So for one order i am basically asked to pay twice.

I have been a faithful customer and have ordered multiple times through zomato but still i am held accountable for this issue even though its not my fault.

Counter Argument - But BJP lost in Jharkhand!

Opposing View - BJP would have lost by an even bigger margin in Jharkhand had paper ballots been used.

&#x200B;

I think the CAA, NRC, NPR protest is at a stage now that it can be used to rope in related issues and expand the reach of protests to meet demands which should have been granted to us long ago.

The Expanded Five point demand by protesters should be :-

1. Roll back CAA. Population census is fine (under Census Act 1948), it does not come under the ambit of Citizenship Act of 1955. However, NPR and NRIC do come under the ambit of Citizenship Act - the government should say that they do not intend to go through with the exercise of NPR and NRIC in their current term - until 2024.
2. Jobs, water and affordable food - where are ""achche din""? This was all promised by the government.
3. Ban EVM from all forms of elections in India - only paper ballots.
4. Police involved in manhandling of CAA protesters and breaking protester's property should be indicted in fast trial courts.
5. State government should compensate families of victims abused by the police.

&#x200B;

The protesters should not stop protesting unless all these demands are met summarily - we need to tell the government this time  who really holds the power.

"Class Action Lawsuits / Distressed Real Estate Investors  

Is there any forum / platform for stressed out RE Investors (or any other group of distressed customers) where they can get together and possibly plan out a Class Action Lawsuit? ( [https://www.obhanandassociates.com/blog/class-action-suits-in-india/?utm\_source=Mondaq&amp;utm\_medium=syndication&amp;utm\_campaign=View-Original](https://www.obhanandassociates.com/blog/class-action-suits-in-india/?utm_source=Mondaq&amp;utm_medium=syndication&amp;utm_campaign=View-Original) )

Most, if not all, RE Developers have been notorious for raising money for project X and then putting that money in use for project Y, while delaying and eventually stopping the 'Reassured Return' payments that they had originally promised. Moreover, developers have indirectly forced RE Investors, who often do not have any other rational choice, to accept changes in the original agreements of the investment. These changes always mean a loss to the investor and a convenient gain for the developer.

Because of high litigation costs and all the other headaches associated with litigation, one particular investor often does not possess the time and patience to fight against these asshole companies. More often than not the developers get away with their bullshit. The ones who have the courage to protest are only met with employees at the lowest level.

I can't seem to find a platform where investors in a particular project can get together and discuss further plans of action. There's GOT to be one! And if there is'nt one then how can one approach to connect with other investors in the same project?

Please feel free to reach out /comment if you can relate to this post / know of someone who might.

Looking forward to pick some brains in this community.

I recently got out of a relationship that was going nowhere and have been feeling great and free after the breakup. However, some people around me like to remind me that I am a loser for not being 'settled' yet. And this is not some direct insult as well. It comes in form of subtle concerns such as ""Oh, people will start thinking there is something wrong with you"" and shit. Geez, relax you fucking 'relatives'. I am 31, not 80. Even 80 year olds are dating and finding partners. I want to take time and focus on myself and my hobbies. Who cares what age I settle in or even not settle for that matter. I may find someone I want to marry at 35,40,45 or not at all. Does it diminish any joy in life? Hell no! Yeah, sometimes it feels like it would be nice to have a partner, but it's foolish to think about what you don't have rather than what can be enjoyed right now. Even though I logically understand that I will be just fine and hopefully find a partner in future, this judgement by relatives (and sometimes even friends) undermines my confidence and makes me think that I should get 'settled' first before enjoying life.

"Delhi style authentic Butter Chicken recipe Delhi style Butter Chicken, very close to what you get at Moti Mahal, the inventor of Butter Chicken.

The Delhi style Butter chicken is all about generosity. You need a gravy that's creamy, not oily or greasy. And it's a very heavy dish, reserved for special occasions. 

&gt;Step 1: The Chicken.

First, let's make the chicken. Traditionally, Tandoori Chicken is used but since it's not possible to make it at home, let's make something close. 
Take 500 grams of chicken  boneless or with bones. 
Add lime juice, salt and marinate for 30 mins. 

After 30 mins, squeeze off excess water from the chicken and add kashmiri red chilli, tandoori masala, 2 tsp of mustard oil and leave it to marinate for 1 hour. 

Now cook the chicken by placing it on a hot pan. Do not flip it constantly. Let it cook for 10 mins on each side. It takes about 30-35 mins to get fully cooked. 
Once the chicken is cooked, keep it aside. 

&gt;Step 2: The Gravy

Gravy is the most important thing. For this, take 4 tomatoes and throw in a pressure cooker for 4 whistles. 
Now puree the tomatoes and run them through a sieve. 

Now cook the filtered tomato puree in a non stick pan for 30-40 mins. Keep adding water if it goes too dry. 

Now your gravy and chicken are done. 

&gt;Step 3: Butter Chicken. 

Now it's time to combine and make butter chicken. 

Just  before you want to eat, in a hot pan, add your tomato gravy. Now add some chilli powder, two green chillies, salt and stir. Taste and adjust salt as needed. Now add the chicken. 

Notice how we haven't added any butter or oil till now to the gravy? That's because it's crucial not to add the butter and cream until the very end. 

Now it's time to add a good amount of butter For a typical serving, I suggest 40 grams of butter. 

Once the butter has melted, add 150 ml of fresh, low-fat cream. (I use amul). 
Butter chicken gravy is 40% tomatoes and 60% butter and cream. 

Mix it all together and immediately turn off the flame. 
Before serving, add some Kasuri Methi to finish off. 

Follow these steps and you'll get Butter Chicken that tastes exactly like Delhi Butter Chicken.",Food

"The problem with the anti-CAA protests is the messaging adopted by the liberals and the leftists The CAA is a mistake. That much is certain. But unfortunately some of the messaging I've seen seems to harp on the fact that the CAA and the NRC will somehow benefit Hindus while affecting Muslims, while this is not obvious and I don't know if it is true.   
  
The CAA is for Hindus/Jains/Buddhists/Parsis/Christians from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh, right? So if the CAA is introduced, it would prevent Indian born Muslims from being able to establish their citizenship during the NRC, if the NRC is done stupidly like it was done in Assam. That much is clear. Then these Muslims would have to wait for 11 years to be able to apply for citizenship in India, in the meantime losing their assets and their right to work or free movement within India. That's fucked up. Almost everyone knows this. 
  
But if the NRC is introduced, that would also exclude *India* born Hindus who can't prove their citizenship from being able to apply for citizenship, right? So *India* born Hindus and other minorities like Sikhs or Parsis or Siddis can *also* get fucked, right? The CAA explicitly says it only accommodates for refugees from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh. If a hypothetical non-Muslim family cannot prove they are from India *or* the other 3 countries, they get fucked, right? What are they supposed to do? Forget the obvious examples of tribals or migrants. What is a family living in a MHADA compound in Mumbai supposed to do? What about Koli fishermen? 
  
So why are the anti-CAA protests revolving solely around how it will affect only Muslims? It will affect every single person in India. Even assuming a best case scenario and an error rate of just 5%, it will still affect 50 million people. It will affect everyone - not just Congress voters or ""libtards"" or ""sickulars"". It will affect bhakts also.   
  
Why are bhakts even supporting and defending this nonsense? They should be opposing this too, since (like DeMo) this will affect them a lot too. In fact, I now notice bhakts now criticizing DeMo when they blindly supported it in 2016.   
  
I predict they will begin criticizing CAA/NPR/NRC about CAA/NPR/NRC in a few years when some of their own citizenships come into question - because remember, depending on when the government sets the cutoff for NRC, we have to establish our citizenship to before that date by proving ""ancestry"" and not being perceived as a ""doubtful citizen"" : both these terms have no provision for legal documentation. How do I prove ancestry? What are ancestral documents?   
  
The BJP is arrogantly setting itself up for yet another clusterfuck purely motivated by 2 things: a hatred for Muslims, and the quest to plunder as much of India as possible. Remember, if we are declared ""doubtful"" citizens then while we are ""under trials"" to get on the NRC, the government can seize our assets as far as I know.  
  
Seriously it boggles my mind that bhakts who can also be affected by this issue are supporting it. This is not a Muslim vs Hindu or a liberal vs secular issue. This is a common sense vs brain dead arrogance issue. This is not a ""their side"" vs ""our side"" thing at all, even though the messaging has been about that. This potentially fucks every single Indian irrespective of political preferences, gender, ethnicity, caste or religion. Its complete madness.  
  
There are better ways to do this. I mena even the elections are done in a phased manner. If the BJP is desperate to root out illegal immigrants, then they should think 5000 times before putting a country through something that will fuck it raw again. 2016 was enough.",CAA-NRC-NPR

"We strongly condemn the communications blackout in Jammu and Kashmir and urge an end to internet shutdowns across India The developments of the past few days are of immense consequence to  the future of our democracy, and the voices from Jammu and Kashmir need  to be heard the loudest, not silenced en masse.

Access to the  internet is a human right. Massive economic, social and individual harm  caused when it is disrupted. But the human costs are much deeper.  Cutting off Internet access prevents people from using the Internet to  reach out for help, and makes them panic. They cannot make sure their  loved ones are safe, or practice their right to expression and political  participation - the government cannot unreasonably deny anyone in this  country this right. We believe that internet based communications play a  vital role in promoting greater trust between people and their  government.

Arguments on security and public safety which are  often made have resulted in a situation where India has the highest  number of internet shutdowns globally. Most of these happen in Jammu and  Kashmir. As per SFLC’s internet shutdown [tracker](https://internetshutdowns.in/)  this is the 51st time (atleast) this year that Kashmir has faced an  internet shutdown and it won’t be the last until there is a serious  reform on shutdown laws.

We have through our work consistently  over months highlighted how it results in harm to different parts of  India. From Rajasthan, West Bengal, Maharashtra. But tonight, we are  concerned about Jammu and Kashmir. People there who are suffering from  anxiety and bewilderment due to a deprivation of internet and mobile  communication services. We are concerned for their safety, physical and  mental care. 

The last few days has underscored the need for legal  reform given that as per our understanding the existing law under which  orders for internet disruptions are passed undermine our fundamental  rights. **IFF urges the government to stop these arbitrary shutdowns that lack any sort of structure or oversight.**

Jammu and Kashmir and all of India deserves better. These are our constitutional promises which must be fulfilled.

"A criticism of the New Education Policy 2019 and existent education policies **Problems with respect to HECI and fee fixation :**  One of the biggest problems that the policy has done, is that it has legitimized the policy of state exit and buttressed the belief of Private Education providing Quality education. **HEFA, as has been founded by GoI in association with Canara Bank and has  a corpus of 1 lakh crore of which centre is paying only 8500 crores, puts this whole thing into perspective. The rest of the corpus is to be attained via loans, which has to be repaid by institutes over period of time. Now, indirectly asking, on whom will the institutes push over this liability of 90,000 crores? Its the students, and the pricing of courses**. While Fee fixation and allowing autonomy is welcome to an extent, but let us not fool ourselves, any HEI with half decent infra would need a fuckton of expenditure and the money has to be absorbed from the peoples pockets

&#x200B;

**A blueprint towards privatisation of Higher education.** Not a word has been spoken about Quality Assurance or the fact of Accountability fixation towards Private institutes. ASSOCHAM reports that 93% of the MBAs in our country is unemployable. ( [https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/featurephilia/story/mba-education-problems-328626-2016-07-11](https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/featurephilia/story/mba-education-problems-328626-2016-07-11) ) Now lets get into this quandary. We want to privatise education without a semblance of accountability towards them really providing people quality skill upgradation. Let us look into the average unemployability, the Private college Engineer stands much worse in employability situation than the average NIT/JU/BESU (and am not even taking the better NITs and IITs and IIScs into picture). **THE WHOLE DOCUMENT PROMISES US LAVISH WORDS, MUCH PROMOTION, BUT IT SPEAKS ZILCH ABOUT WHERE THE FUNDS ARE GOING TO BE RAISED FROM. In the previous year we had seen how the INSTITUTE OF EMINENCE tag was given to JIO institute. This meant that they could raise a massive 1000 crores for over 10 years , but we all know the project never even begun, how can we judge its credibility and potential. The government did away 1000 crore clause for private institutes temporarily, but there has not been any subsequent clarification on it, thus proving  the** ***crony- corporate- neta - babudom clout*** **is taking over the education system too.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**The Report clearly shows that round about 49% of the children who take up education in Class 1 do not continue it beyond Class 10.**  The policy sort of considers that  this ratio will be maintained, and we should actually place infrastructure in such a fashion that it caters and provides quality care for the 51%. Implicitly it has recognized that the rest of the 49% will not come up, and that there would be more stress towards the 51% who continue than bringing up the 49% who are exiting the net.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Fails to address the biggest issue : EMPLOYABILITY .** Take this in two parts\*\*.\*\*

&#x200B;

**Employability of the lesser skilled :** THE Present Government **SINCE 2015** has been pushing the skilling agenda. Furthermore as has been the priorities of the policy, skilling has been mandated as an important part of the DEP,2019.   It had promoted the PPP model for skilling. But the model as Sharda Prasad report has shown has failed to muster much influence. So much so that 99.5% of the skilling units are government owned. The skilling institutes are marred with **CONFLICT OF INTEREST,** Malgovernance and the credibility of their skilling quality is pretty poor, once we look into the rates of employability after completing the courses. The NSQF framework has adopted a technique of **recognition to prior learning** \- but although the skill of a layman is getting recognized, what is its effective use, if it doesnt lead to any jobs? In the above tone lets also take up the **ISSUE OF SYLLABI in VT and diploma courses. The course structure in VT is haphazard enough with its whole bouquet of courses, preventing streamlining. This means aligning the courses to international requirements, ensuring a basic foundation in the 3Rs, and life-long learning**. It implies national standards for an in-demand skill set with national/global mobility that translates into better jobs. Short duration courses (with no real skills) that provide low pay for suboptimal jobs cannot be called national standards. Hence the current national standards have to drastically improve.   Germany has only 340 courses — in accordance with the National Classification of Occupations 2015 (which itself was based on the International Standard Classification of Occupations). Such trainees will be a national asset. **What we have instead are nearly 10,000 standards, produced mostly by consultants.** There cannot be thousands of standards (compressed into 2,000 qualification packs/job roles), and “delivered” to trainees in a matter of a few months. **This is not what the National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF) had recommended. The focus should be in strengthening reading, writing and arithmetic skills.** No skill development can succeed if most of the workforce lacks the foundation to pick up skills in a fast-changing world. Vocational training must by definition be for a minimum of a year, which includes internship (without which certification is not possible). **Short-term training should be confined to recognising prior learning of informally trained workers who are already working.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Employability of the higher skilled :** The problem of the higher skilled is sufficiently different from that of the lower skilled. Such a situation has happened due to few reasons :

1. promoting a flawed pattern of **EDUCATION FOR JOBS and MARKS**
2. Lack of requisite jobs in the sectors of choice. **Yojana in 2017 had carried out an Important little study where it matched the aspirations of students of HEI to the jobs that were prevalant across the state.** The results were near abysmal, given only few states had above 40% correlation between the jobs they were producing and the jobs that the students were demanding.
3. **Putting in a process of ""Hands On"" education and not  ""Hands free"" education.** While the government has been pushing its cause of making innovation an important part for Ranking HEIs and ranking technical institutes,and brought in a plethora of schemes to Encourage partnerships with such colleges that have a ranking of less than 200 as per QS,  the problems involving the lack of **""Hands On""** education are far more complicated than just that. It involves the problem of RoI on such innovation (credits system), the push towards Quantitative numbers (yes, more the number of papers, and not more the number of papers in journals having high impact factor), the lack of imaginativeness in our educational regime across society, all contributes to the same.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Romanticizing of Sanskrit and the past. Case in point, Bharatiya Shiksha Board.** No, we arent going to become a vishwaguru by promoting cow pee as a cancer cure. No, Bharatiya and vedic shiksha boards can never be equal to CISCE and CBSE. The skill imparted for doing astrology can only get a person to some VHP shakha, sorry it is never going to a man a job to earn a living. Promoting pseudo science in the name of TRADITION is blasphemy.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Mission Nalanda and Mission Taxila has said that there will be Higher Univ in every district,**  but there is no plan in place. The government trying to establish the fact that pushing private people to open and run univs can be good, but that will never be inclusive. **To remember all those who believe this is some new innovative plan of mudiji, the RUSA scheme and its intentions of opening HEIs across all EDUCATIONALLY BACKWARD districts was present since UPA days. The present re-wrapping and calling for the Private sector gives me only a feeling of Skill India 2.0**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**ASER AND NAS reports clearly show the abysmal state of education in our primary levels. There has not been one attempt made to fix the situation,** rather than a vague policy prescription of INTERACTIVE EDUCATION. **Mid day meal and good nutrition might attract and increase the GER at entry level,** but it isnt going to solve the **LEARNING POVERTY GAP ISSUES .** Let us not fool ourselves, a country where the average class 5 to class 8 going child struggles to solve class 2 mathematics, skilling is an useless exercise. OECDs PISA report had ranked us abysmally, so much so that we withdrew participation from PISA and joined it back only this year. Economic Survey 2017 part 1 shows that the learning gap is far greater in girls wrt mathematics. In such a case solutions can be manifold. **Should we create a separate situation for girls, where they feel confident enough to take part in maths and science related activities? Studies have shown that given the Backward Upbringing that a female child often gets, combined with the fact that there is a huge Number of UNWANTED FEMALES ( Computed by metric Sex ratio of Last child) it is only expected that they would feel Underconfident than their fellow male compatriot who has better ACCESS to CARE, NUTRITION at home. The worst part of the report has been, although it has agreed time and over again about the learning poverty gap, it has ONLY PROMOTED SOME COSMETIC MEASURES LIKE FLIPPED LEARNING AND DIGITAL BOARDS.**

&#x200B;

**BRINGING UNIVS UNDER CIVIL SERVICE CONDUCT RULES.** One of the most important places of societal evolution and innovation and invention is the University. The varsity must be kept a free place, where infusion of ideas, permeability and penetration of ideas must be maximum. On the other hand, our government has left no stone unturned to bring the Univs under the ambit of CCS rules. Vide CCS rules ; A professor would not be able to openly criticize and elaborately express his dissent against a government policy in an editorial without having its approval. The problem is not just in bringing Univs under CCS, but a concealed attempt at making SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY and PROGRESS subservient to some whimsical stuff written in Ancient Textbooks. The Indian Science Congress was just a blatant attempt to push its agenda. Such vile attempts are being concealed under norms of **""PROMOTING RESEARCH IN CHOICE SECTORS"" , "" GRANTS FORWARDED TO SUCH RESEARCH THAT IS SOCIALLY VIABLE**""  and such other ambiguous terminology. (Vide schemes like IMPRESS, IMPRINT etc)

&#x200B;

**BRAIN DRAIN AND BRAIN USE .**  A wonderful opportunity lay right infront of our hands to reverse back atleast a section of brain that has been drained. Given the rise of RIGHT in USA and across many European nations, we could actually reverse and bring some of our talented brains back to our country. But for that we need a liberated education system, and a system that is ready to suitably employ such people with due remuneration. Also lets move into the issue of **BRAIN USE.** A very important issue here can be one of **social learning based methods, via ""Interested people"". Can we tap such brains, that are probably voluntarily unemployed, or maybe want a more respectable employment, and try to push them in sectors where they can impart learning to say a TRIBAL school, or maybe the average SSA school, with a honorary compensation**? We have always been crying ""HEY NO TEACHERS AND NO RESOURCE"" while we actually have resources that we arent ready to look into.

**ARE WE TRYING TO BE A GLOBAL LABOUR ECONOMY OR A GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY? The whole policy has been mired with ambiguities, where it speaks of IMPROVED ACCESS, but no QUALITY IMPROVEMENT, where it speaks of ACCESS IMPROVEMENT, but doesnt really proceed to describe how it would finance, and in places where it speaks of FINANCING of HEIs it seems to forgot the margins of difference that exist between a PSU and a Govt funded HEI. Private, for profit  education has never been linked to improved access in areas of low access. What seems further is the deceit by the govt to concede an explicit percentage of society as going to be ""leftovers, since they wont continue education anyways"" , and the deceit by the govt to EXIT in a sustained manner from a section that needed greater govt involvement in the veener of ""PRIVATE EMPOWERMENT"". The push for higher fees with minimal ""restraint"" will only lead to severe EXCLUSION of the lower rungs of the MIDDLE CLASS from the advantages of HEI while buttressing the hold of the upper echelons of the 1% both ""Sociologically and systematically"".**

A total hypocrisy where we speak of inclusive education yet, we believe FOR PROFIT education will push education to the EDUCATIONALLY BACKWARD PLACES. The Vacancies in the biggest and best Institutes wrt FACULTY are being kept vacant intentionally, to show them in poor light, to the public, enabling generous privatization. Rather than being lost in dreams of how digital blackboards and play based education and a 5+3+3+4 education , which are cosmetic reforms to the real problems of POVERTY (in learning) , UNEMPLOYMENT and DEPLORABLE INFRASTRUCTURE.

"Hear me out. This might be a rant. Maybe this government doesn't care about the people at all. Maybe we deserve this government as we did not vote them out in the last elections. Maybe this would be a lesson to future voters on whom not to vote. The way the leaders of this government are behaving, it is quite clear they have their heads buried so up in their own asses, they are totally oblivious of the ground realities.

**ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS-JOY FOR INC, WAKE-UP CALL FOR BJP**

**Can the Congress upset the odds in 2019?**

The biggest question everybody had before today’s results was can the Congress fight back against Modi and BJP, especially with 2019 around the corner. While their performance in Telangana and Mizoram was disappointing, it will take heart from its wins in Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh. 

For a party which was in disarray until a year and half ago with no clear sense of direction from the party high command, the Congress has slowly staggered back onto its feet to fight the Modi and Shah duo. With a seemingly reinvigorated Rahul Gandhi at the helm, they have taken the fight to the BJP in Modi’s own bastion-Gujarat, cobbled together an alliance in Karnataka and now snatched Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh back from the BJP. 

While the party is trying hard to capitalise on the anger of the masses against the Central government’s policies and decisions, the Congress still has a lot of work to do on the ground level if it seriously wants to come back to power in 2019. While the results might show Congress winning in three states, there is a very distinct and real possibility that voters were fed up with their state BJP governments due to anti-incumbency and they are still going to vote for Modi to become the PM again in 2019.The Congress’s performance in Rajasthan is also considered to be relatively disappointing with chaotic seat distribution, infighting and rebel Congress leaders costing the party another 15 odd seats.

**What next for the BJP?**

While the results aren’t going to make BJP workers too happy, the BJP still remains in pole position to come back to power in 2019. With the so called ‘Third Front’ still nowhere near fruition and the Congress’s efforts to pitch RaGa against NaMo not exactly gathering steam with other opposition parties means that Modi continues to be the most popular political leader in India currently. The extradition of Christian Michel related to the Agusta Westland scam and the recent court order allowing the extradition of Vijay Mallya from the UK also serve as a timely boost to the BJP’s anti-corruption rhetoric, which was on a slippery slope after the Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi sagas. The BJP has also made no effort to hide its Hindutva agenda, starting with the renaming of Allahabad to Prayagraj and Faizabad to Ayodhya. BJP led state governments in Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh also cleared the way for the building of gigantic statues of Lord Shiva and Rama respectively and this Hindutva pitch will only get more brazen in the lead-up to 2019.

While the BJP might be smug about its chances in 2019, it has to keep an eye on the grumbling middle class and farmers-both unhappy with poll promises not being kept. The agrarian distress and lack of job creation have taken the shine off Modi’s ‘booming economy’ pitch and the BJP will be anxious to ensure it doesn’t snowball further. Furthermore, the central government’s rift with the RBI and frequent clash-ins with the Supreme Court have created the image of an overzealous central government keen to take control of all independent central agencies. 

**Will KCR lead for the formation of a Third Front?**

TRS’s emphatic victory in the state of Telangana and K Chandrashekar Rao’s victory speech might mean the resurgence in the chances for the formation of a Third Front consisting of other regional satraps including Mamata Banerjee and Mayawati. The Third Front has traditionally been a cluster of regional parties which choose to neither align with the Congress or the BJP. However, the Third Front, which has always been talked of as an alternative to India’s two-party stronghold, has never managed to give a serious fight to the Congress or the BJP in recent history. The only times the Third Front or Federal Front provided a serious threat to the Congress or BJP was in between 1996 and 1998 when it staked power at the Centre twice under H.D. Deve Gowda. Quite predictably, the government collapsed soon after due to infighting and horse-trading of MPs. 

It will be interesting to see if a Third Front comes into existence in time for 2019 and more interestingly, if they can prevent making the mistakes that they have committed in the past and become a force to reckon with.

**Controversy about EVMs**

Adding further fuel to the EVM tampering controversy, it was reported this week by multiple news sources that CCTV malfunctions occurred in the strongrooms where the EVMs were stored. Technical snags in CCTV systems installed inside the storage rooms came from Vidisha, Mandla and Bhopal. In Vidisha, it is reported that CCTV cameras went blank for 15 minutes while the one in Mandla went blank for 2 hours. Tough questions must be asked of the Election Commission as to how such a situation was allowed to develop in the first place and what it plans to do to ensure the electoral system isn’t compromised.",Policy/Economy

"Your annual reminder that India's AYUSH Minister promised in 2016 that we would have a 'yoga-based' cure for cancer within a year. Spoiler: We don't. 

Please note, he said ' prevention and cure' and not 'treatment'. He said, 'cure' and not 'palliative treatment'. He said, 'cure' and not 'help reverse the effects'. 

> ""There is an institute in Bengaluru. They have found a yoga technique for prevention and cure of cancer. We have collected all documentation and the process is going on,"" Naik told reporters.

[Source](https://food.ndtv.com/food-drinks/yoga-based-cure-for-cancer-within-a-year-ayush-minister-1291302)



Please note that he said the 'cure' is already in the testing phase and will be approved within the year. Please note he said this is 2016. Please note that he said that the cure had been 'proved' - in 2016. 

> Mr. Naik said a technique for such cure developed by Bengaluru-based Swami Vivekananda Yoga Anusandhana Samsthana (S-VYASA) is just about a year away from endorsement from his Ministry.

[Source](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/its-proven-that-yoga-can-cure-cancer-ayush-minister-of-state-shripad-naik/article8399509.ece)

> ""A Bengaluru-based institute has proved with research that diseases like cancer can be cured by yoga. They have proved it,"" Naik said during the inauguration of National Arogya fair in Goa today.

[Source](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/research-shows-cancer-can-be-cured-by-yoga-shripad-naik/articleshow/51561776.cms?from=mdr)

Please note that the media mocked him and he never said it again, but he didn't apologise for giving India's 14 lakh cancer patients false hope. Remember this when you listen to his and his ministry's comments on coronavirus.

"Indian population at large is still not aware of the gravity of the situation. Businesses are still to implement work from home. Social distancing still an elusive concept to most of the people. As an Indian living abroad, I am very concerned about my family and fellow citizens. I live in Canada. Everything is almost at standstill here. Here, the government was extremely late in implementing measures and the country's population will pay the price for their foolishness. However, they are sort of saved by their low population densities and better public awareness.

 India on the other hand had implemented measures at the borders quite early in the timeline. However, we Indians are at much higher risks as compared to other countries thanks to our high population density and poor medical infrastructure. 

My parents and siblings live in Bangalore and I don't think they get the gravity of the situation. My sister still has to go to her job. My brother-in-law still takes the company cab to his office. They are corporates and it's highly likely that their jobs can be done from home. But their companies have not yet declared anything on those lines.

My dad who's 67, still goes to vegetables market everyday to pick fresh produce and is refusing my advise of buying food in bulk and stocking up the kitchen for two-three weeks of isolation. I am asking my parents to minimize their trips to markets and other people's homes to once or twice a week. 

My brother-in-law and sister are also not heeding my advice of stocking up food for two-three weeks. They are still going to restaurants to have dinners.

My relatives are getting their house renovated and are arguing that this virus is nothing and I am panicking without reason. Their argument: work needs to go on and if everything stops, how will poor people like the labourers fend for themselves?

 I am just trying to ask them to postpone all non essential activities for the next two weeks. But, it seems I am talking to an unaware audience.

"Most effective way to deal with Indian clients. Hi there.

I was hoping to trouble you for advice about how to deal Indian clients.

I'm a Sri Lankan criminal lawyer practicing in Canada.  My office is in an area with a large number of immigrants from South East Asia.

I don't want to generalize, but I've had some issues with Indian and Pakistani clients.  For one, despite being in an area with many Indian and Pakistani client, I've only retained very few Indian and Pakistani clients.

Despite only being retained by very few Indian clients,  I get a lot of calls and even visits from Indian individuals.  These people often try and take up as much time as possible and ask loads of questions but will refuse to sign up or pay for anything.  Because they're a large community in my area, they actually interfere with my practice by taking and energy time away from paying customers.   After many such visits, I've began to realize that they were only after free advice and not interested in buying anything.

Of course people of other races call for free advice from time to time as well.  But they are in 99% of cases honest about it, and polite about not taking up too much of my time.  Unfortunately the opposite is true for nearly 90% of Indian callers.

Also, I noticed that the few Indian customers I do get are demanding and not very good at keeping up with payment.

Of course this hasn't been the case with all Indian clients, some have been absolutely stellar.  However, it has been the case with way too many of them to the point where I realized I need a better strategy to deal with  it.  Of course, this only seems to apply to people who have immigrated from India or Pakistan relatively recently or people who haven't really integrated well to Canadian culture.  Indians who have integrated to Canadian culture are a joy to work with.  And because at least one person is bound to say it - yes I understand generalizations, not all Indians etc etc.

I realize this sounds like a rant  but it's not.  The reason I'm here is because I realized that there must be some of you who run service oriented businesses in India.   If I'm getting a disproportionate amount of this behavior from Indian clients, Indian businesses must get it alot from their clients.  My question is how do you deal with it?  How do you run an effective business under these conditions?

Do businesses in India have a method for spotting and  weeding out individuals who are looking for free advice and just wasting your time?   Do businesses in india have a strategy for dealing with difficult or demanding clients.   What strategies to Indian businesses employ to make sure payment schedule are met on time.   And finally, I'm starting to suspect that the main way to get Indian clients is through referrals through someone they know, is this suspicion accurate or is there another way to market effectively to Indian clients.

Basically what's the best way for a business owner to serve Indian clients without losing his mind?",Scheduled

"Join the Protests before its too Late #SamvidhanZindabad For all the fence-sitters who are doubtful if they should come to protests, keep in mind that these students are not just fighting for their future, but for your future as well. Fight against CAA+NRC+NPR before its too late.

How does it feel like watching someone getting amputated, blinded, beaten by lathis and Tear-gassed while fighting for your Rights?

\-1) \[Coz fuck you Natural Numbers\] Govt is trying to give these protests a communal angle. DONT fall for their trap. Many international news have also claimed this being anti-muslim, try to clear things as much as possible. Assam wants every illegal migrant out, be it Muslim, Hindu or Sikh. And I support that. But everyone should be given fair trial and Govt should give those legal citizens of India which are not in NRC full support to procure documents of proof. 

CAA+NRC+NPR are not Anti-Muslim, they are Anti-India and Anti-Constitution. **Our founding fathers i.e. Mahatma Gandhi, Patel, Nehru, Bhagat Singh, Maulana Azad, Sukhdev, Chandra Shekhar Azad, Bhimrao Ambedkar, Neta Ji and many many more, all wanted a Secular India and they formulated this Constitution (and Article 14 in that) and set the guideline for the future course of our nation. We owe our Freedom to them and we should respect their Principles**. By going against the spirit of our Constitution we are disrespecting them. If we start questioning their decisions, then we have gone too astray and are not worth being called an Indian.

0) How to protest while Section 144 is implemented - [https://mobile.twitter.com/akshaytarfe/status/1207504829343383552](https://mobile.twitter.com/akshaytarfe/status/1207504829343383552)

[https://mobile.twitter.com/TheSphinxSpeaks/status/1207434348502212608](https://mobile.twitter.com/TheSphinxSpeaks/status/1207434348502212608)

1) Go through this article to understand what is going on **behind the scenes at BJP HQ**. How they are planning to communalize the country.

[https://thewire.in/media/cab-bjp-whatsapp-groups-muslims](https://thewire.in/media/cab-bjp-whatsapp-groups-muslims)

2) Also, keep in mind that the new evil is NPR, a rebranded NRC exercise. They have added 2 new questions to the census-based on Nationality of Parents and details of Passport

3) Data Protection Bill has already been introduced in Lok Sabha. Go through it. Summary at  [https://www.businesstoday.in/current/policy/personal-data-protection-bill-2019-central-government-power-may-undermine-privacy-of-citizens-people/story/392186.html](https://www.businesstoday.in/current/policy/personal-data-protection-bill-2019-central-government-power-may-undermine-privacy-of-citizens-people/story/392186.html)  I think after we get success on CAA we should continue the momentum and protest on other issues as well.

4) I don't have any personal experience of getting beaten by Lathis, though I have participated in protests earlier in my life. I would suggest the protestors to wear at least 4-5 layers of thick clothing so as to minimize the effect of Lathis. Heck, we are a nation of Cricket fanatics.. why don't we wear Helmets and Cricket Pads underclothes and protest? 

5) For past few days, while having a discussion with fairly educated people, I saw some of the biases in these people eg. Muslims are bad people (*Eureka!*), Muslims have beard (*WTF? Sikhs have too, so you'll go behind them next?*), Muslims are extremists, America also censors them (*US censors a lot of other people too for eg your Kaka*),  [Hindus went from 23% to 7% in Pak, which is false](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/pakistan-bangladesh-non-muslim-population-citizenship-amendment-bill-bjp-1627678-2019-12-12)  ( [Another report, choose which one you want to believe](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-50720273) ) . It's pretty normal to have bias and I don't blame these people as I too had these bias at some point of time but then sense prevailed. Any community of people looks at another community with suspicion, and when most of the Political and Film fraternity has been painting you with a single colour, it is bound to happen. 

Don't let this narrative get to you. **Bad people are there in every religion**, be it Christians, Hindus, Muslims or Sikh or even Buddhists. There are Christian terrorists, sikh terrorists, hindu terrorists, buddhist terrorists and muslim terrorists. Just because there are terrorists in some religion doesn't mean all the followers of that religion are evil or terrorists. 

6) This whole fucking exercise is actually bad for Non-muslims. **Rs. 1900 crore has already been spent by State for Assam NRC**. Govt has cut Rs. 3000 crore from Education budget. What do you estimate it will cost to do the same NRC exercise nationwide. Any guesses? Hint: There are 28 States in India. 

Growth is already low, Inflation is increasing, All sectors are down. It doesn't take a genius to know, such divisions and instigation on communal lines will only lead to communal riots which will affect many innocent Non-muslim and Muslim families country-wide and Govt will not come to their help. 

PS. I am not from Delhi but I am planning to shift to Delhi in January to dedicate myself to active protest and continue the momentum further. Meanwhile, I am trying to help my brothers and sisters on ground by spreading awareness through social media.

"Suggestions for Indian music that isn't from popular films? Hey /r/india! 

ABD (i don't consider myself confused), I'm looking for interesting Indian music that isn't from popular films. I would make exceptions for music from films that is particularly interesting or different, not your standard dance numbers or romantic songs. 

&amp;nbsp;

I was recently listening to the Dil Se soundtrack and found it really interesting, dynamic and quite different from your average bollywood movie! The music is not standard and even the production is not standard, there's a lot of dynamism in the tracks. For example, in Satarangi Re it starts off with that high pitch vocal singing and then suddenly breaks into the beat. I found it really great. 

&amp;nbsp;

Anyways, I also would love to find Indian music that isn't from movies. Like, is there a vibrant musician scene in India that isn't what we get internationally? Any hidden bands you really like that wouldn't have a chance to be marketed abroad? I'd also be interested in folk recordings. I'm not particularly interested in Classical music because those are quite easy to find and plentiful. 


&amp;nbsp;

Things I'm not looking for:

* Dance beat songs
* autotuned vocals
* highly repetitive lyrics

&amp;nbsp;

"You can be on any side of the political spectrum and no matter who you are, you can't deny...our country is in chaos I have both right wing and left wing relatives and friends. But no matter who they are, they all agree - our country is in utter chaos. For right wing supporters like my dad, the reason for this chaos is 'liberal Islamists', illegal Muslims trying to take over India, etc. (you know, the usual right wing rants) and for the left wing supporters, the reason for this chaos are the WhatsApp University passed bhakts who are pro-fascism. But whatever the reason is, one thing remains - that our country's conditions aren't good at all.

If you look  from a foreigners' perspective, India is now a hellhole. Its economy is in shambles, riots are breaking out all over India over the controversial acts of BJP like NRC, CAB, University fee hikes, etc., rape reports are rising with the recent brutal Telangana rape case, Kashmir has been in dark for 4 months now, internet shutdown has now become the norm of BJP and if your area is facing internet shutdown, its just another day in India. Not to mention things like pollution, water running out, environmental and climate crisis, etc.

Its very hard to maintain peace and sanity in minds of people in this pathetic condition of this country. No wonder Twitter and other social media are such a toxic place nowadays. Nobody is at peace, at least in this country, everybody is paranoid, frustrated and angry at each other. Sometimes I just wonder what our country initially aspired to become - a developed nation with money, technology, freedom and peace. And look at what it has become.",Politics

"[TIL] You can pay 'Indian Medical Association' (IMA) and get your commercial product endorsed by them. While watching world cup, I noticed almost 3 to 4 products getting endorsed by IMA, be it a water purifier, soap, juice, toothpaste. Brands used the tagline that their product is recommended by either Indian Medical Association (IMA) or Indian Dental Association (IDA).

It has become quite an easy way for brands to gain credibility among their customer base. By paying only about 50 lakhs, you can get IMA's nod and use their logo on your product.

Main objectives of IMA includes, promotion and advancement of medical and all related sciences, improving public health and medical education in India, and maintaining the honour and dignity of the medical profession.

**According to IMA sources, the amount received are used to conduct scientific activities, seminars and conferences. But what about ethics?**

"India has a lot more atheism and agnosticism than official statistics present. Officially the 2011 Census says only 0.27% of Indians are non-religious.

But, for e.g. my dad gave my religion as Hindu when the Census dude came, in many other cases the census taker records religion based on the name or community rather than actually asking each person their beliefs.

In 2006 World Values Survey - 6.6% Indians said they had no religion.

In the 2012 WIN-Gallup 13% were not religious, 3% were convinced atheists and 3% were unsure or did not respond.

Historically India has had the richest body of atheistic philosophy in the ancient world - Carvaka, Sāṃkhya, Buddhism and sophisticated god-free philosophies. Our national heros like Nehru and Bhagat Singh were atheists.

Overall we are underestimating irreligion in India due to bad census taking. Discuss.",Non-Political

"Pakodanomics, Ola-Uber Theory, Box Office Theory So when the most intellectual people of the country, honourable  Prime Minister, Finance Minister and IT Minister have made comments on the economy, I decided to go around and look in own way. 

***Note****: I am not an economist. I work in the IT sector and have been outside India from last two years.* 

Last week I visited Vijaywada, Andhra Pradesh almost after two years. All my relatives have settled there and once in a while, I make a visit there. To my surprise, I noticed a lot of changes in the way people spend money and businesses going there.

1. **Vastralatha** is a shopping complex in Vijayawada where a lot of wholesale shopping happens. Shop owners get the clothing raw materials (and clothes) from different locations and sell them there. It is almost the first stop for almost most of the clothes/clothing-material after manufacturing. On having a discussion with one the shopkeeper I came to know that his business gone down drastically. Despite Deepawali coming, there is no surge in sales. He says, ***""There is no cash in the market, how will people buy the goods"".*** Just to know more of him, I tried being naive and said that the government is promoting digital transactions and hence cash is less in the market, to which he replied showing a chart with many QR-codes printed on it, ***""I have PhonePe, Paytm, BHIM, Google-Pay as modes of payments still no increase in business after adopting them"".*** I said that maybe Amazon and Flipkart are consuming his business and he should try moving to online. ***""Nothing in online comes drops from air. They also must go from some outlet. I myself have proxies on Amazon and Flipkart""***
2. Vijayawada is almost like a business capital of Andhra Pradesh. A lot of people from neighbouring places come there to sell their products too. Hence a good number of 2-star and 3-star lodges are there in outskirts of Vijayawada. I then visited one such lodge, which is run by one of my friend's relative. I asked him about the hotel business the past few months to he replied, ***""Has dropped almost half in the last six months. Very few come now, and even those who come are unmarried couples.""***
3. The next day I visited a place called **Poranki**. It is outskirts of Vijayawada, almost a town. I like junk food around and generally eat at around 9:00 PM. The junk food stalls are open till 10:30 PM. I went out that day around 8:00 PM and to my surprise, I found almost all the shops closed. After wandering for 15 mins I found a shop where I ordered **Mirpakayi Bajji (***Mirchi Bhajji/ Big Chillies Fried***).** After having two of them I asked stallkeeper why have the shops closed so fast to which he replied, ***""Are you new to this place. It is happening almost from last one year. No one is having money. Those who have are also spending very cautiously. Due to the lack of customers, I am forced to close the shops early""***
4. The next day morning I visited my village from **Poranki**. *(I am sorry, I cannot tell you the village name for privacy reasons).* My grandma lives there. Besides her home, there are a lot of uneducated people who make materials like hand fans, mats, brooms, etc from coconut leaves and straw. They make them there and then go and sell locally or in other towns and cities. The place used to gleam with joy and noise when people used to sit together and stitch mats. All of that was absent. I asked our neighbour why. He replied, ***""There are more than 150 mats in stock not sold. What is the use of sitting and making more of them.""*** People make these products and travel via big share autos generally to towns. Autos are more frequent and easily available. The afternoon I went to our village bus stop, where autos also are parked nearby. I took a share auto and asked the driver about very fewer people at the bus stop. He said , ***""No one is going out of the village even to sell. Last week 3 autos drivers had sold their autos and moved into other businesses.""***

**My personal inference**: A lot bad is going. The news channels are not showing anything. The ones that do show about this, are yet very far away from the ground realities. I am just wondering about farm labours who have no source of income except daily wage. The news channels and people bragging about Hindi-Muslim debate are either paid or brainwashed. At the ground, there are many structural problems. Sadly many of them think it is their fate rather than the failure of governments.",Business/Finance

"I absolutely hate my current job,wanna get out of it but also worried about the fact that what if i don't get another job or stay unemployed for a long time i work in an IT MNC(joined last yr in august)..i am in a project that requires me to work in a shift from 12pm to 9pm and being new to the project idk much about it how things work and how to go about stuff..when i ask my Team members they don't explain things clearly and expect me to get the tasks done in a given timeframe and also my manager is a pain(expects too much)even the tech stack is outdated and has no future scope...i absolutely hate this but at the same time i fear that if i leave then it would be very difficult for me to search for another company as i have not much work ex(i graduated last year in june) 
reasons i currenlty hate my job(this project in specific):-

1.Team members do not explain things clearly they are all experienced i am new to this so it would take time for me to absorb all the things but they expect me to get it completed asap this causes me anxiety pressure and nervouseness

2. 12pm-9pm this shift+the location of my office is very shady no public transport after 8pm although company provides cab service but i would reach my home faster taking the public transport

3.My manager,he is annoying AF expects too much and never appreciates even if i try and always asks me to send daily status mail(idk what to send if one day theres no progress) 

4.The tech stack is outdated even though there is some Java but no real coding stuff its mainly testing or something like that

P.S. There is bond of 2 years as well,and if i don't pay the bond amount they won't give me a relieving letter(worried about this as it shouldn't be like i was unemployed for an year if i go for an interview somewhere else)

"Long post - I hate high interest rates in India. Long time lurker. Thought I would share some of my rants about India here.
One of the problem with India is extremely high interest rates. When rates are this high (10% compared to 0-2% in many developed countries), cost of doing business is huge.


Consider the following scenarios

1) No one will invest in a business where the return is less than 10% per year. Otherwise, you will just park your money in a bank and earn interest on it. A lot of projects become unviable this way. Setting up big ticket infra projects, green field setups is virtually Impossible without government financial assistance, tax breaks.

2) Property bubble - A 20lakh loan financed at 10% rate for 20 years costs us nearly 50 lakhs including interest payments. So, even if your property prices increase by 150% in 20 years, a CAGR of 5%, you are losing money.

If you include your cost of money, You would have been better off investing those 50 lakhs in a recurring deposit instead of giving EMI. The RD will bring close to 70 lakhs. So a property price appreciation of (70-20/20) 250% or 6.8% CAGR is break even for your money. [I have oversimplified the calculation by not including rent saved, HRA etc]
Compare this to western countries, where property prices hardly rise by 0-2% y/y.

3) Polluting Truck menace - It is taking truck operators 10+ years to breakeven cost on a ageing financed truck. A truck operator will look for more than 10% annual return in order to make money on his investment. To save some more money, they cut corners and are also overloaded producing even more pollution. Read about recent NGT order banning 10+ yrs diesel vehicles.

4) Currency depreciation – Economics 101. A high interest rate depreciates your currency every year. Currency depreciation raises prices of fuels, coal, gas, important imports.

5) Trickle down effect – A lot of goods/ services which change many hands before reaching you becomes expensive, as every middle man would want to earn more than 10% on money invested. Think, cost of fruit/ vegetables you pay vs what a poor farmer receives. Think, petrol pump business, where a dealer has a commission of Rs 2+ for every litre of petrol sold.  

6) Trade deficit with China – Ever wondered why , it is so cheap to produce things in China. One of the reason is low cost of money there. We import every type of shit from China. Things we could have made right here in India.

7) Fiscal deficit from Gold – Stupid Indians keep buying gold thinking that the gold will appreciate like it did in the last  decade. We are the 2nd largest consumer of gold. In reality, the gold prices in $ are at a 5 yr low. But in India, prices have only risen. Do you know why? Hint – 40% currency depreciation..

If USD/INR was at 45 today, gold would only be worth 15k for 10gm.


I could go on and on but would now be interested in hearing your opinion.


Update1. Some of you have said that interest rates are right where they need to be. And that is 100% true. I should have been more clear while wording my rant.
It's just that - I hope for a India which has low interest rates. Obviously its not possible in near future

This year I made a resolution that I will learn something new any chance I get. I got a camera and started learning photography and still learning and one thing that interested me from a very long time is Flying/driving/riding. I always love to drive/ride. Now I am thinking to learn how to fly but I thought it was impossible because you need physics and math ( I am a commerce Student) as an entry requirement. Recently I was looking for flying club for hobby flying and I cam across Bombay Flying Club. They have multiple courses. 

  
 STUDENTS PILOT’S LICENCE (SPL)

 PRIVATE PILOT LICENCE (PPL)

 COMMERCIAL PILOT LICENCE (CPL)  
 [https://www.thebombayflyingclub.com/Pilot\_training.html](https://www.thebombayflyingclub.com/Pilot_training.html) 

  
For the 1st two there is no Physics or Math requirement for learning how to fly but for Commercial Lience you need   Physics and Math’s.   


So what I was wondering If I complete  PRIVATE PILOT LICENCE (PPL) or they also havbe Single Engine Flying Training will I be able for Commercial Pilot Licence like will I be able to join airline industry as pilot.   


Any suggestions/advice will be much appreciated.

"Interesting (mis)use of technology in real estate transactions God's own country has progressed in terms of technology much further than one imagined.

And he said that you could buy it while in the Gelf (he assumed I worked there cuz of my dad) - and hence no restrictions of buying from India or withdrawing cash.

I checked with the seller later, and said he wants cash and the broker is getting him cash - so looks like this guy is not just a real estate broker now, but a bitcoin broker too.

"The Madras HC allows our intervention in the Aadhaar and Social Medial linking petition.  

https://i.redd.it/d07k09qtkv631.jpg

### Highlights

* **Background:** Two writ petitions were filed in the Madras High Court in July 2018 praying for the interlinking of Aadhaar with social media for identity authentication purposes. We were deeply concerned with this development and decided to intervene.
* **Intervention time:** Given the relevance of these cases, IFF goes to Court for the 6th time, continuing its fight for the right to privacy of the citizens of  India, amongst various other concerns. Our stand in court is to protect user privacy, prevent surveillance but also to address the harms and regulatory issues such as end-to-end encryption which are of concern to the Hon'ble Court. Rest assured, all our submissions are to advance digital rights and the constitutional values!

### / Why we decided to intervene.

Information is necessary for a well functioning society. However, it also carries power and creates social structures. For instance social media while making sure all of us remain connected is no longer merely a way to stay in touch. It has become a way of life and permits a wider functionality. This also carries risks and harms. Many social media platforms today are rife with abuse, misinformation and illegal content. It is undermining the demos of Indian democracy. A solution which has been posed in the Madras High Court is linking the real world identities (government ID's such as Aadhaar) with social media accounts.

Concerned by these developments, in early June, 2019, we filed two interventions in *Antony Clement Rubin v. Union of India &amp; Ors* (W.P. No. 20774/2018) and *Janani Krishnamurthy v. Union of India* (W.P. No. 20214/2018). This is in our continuing work in approaching and assisting courts all over India in matters related to technology and fundamental rights. In the hearing today, our intervention application was accepted by the Hon'ble High Court of Madras. We thank our counsels Arun Karthik Mohan and Suhrith Parthasarathy for their representation.

### // Why linking Aadhaar to social media is terrible.

Aadhaar being linked with our social media accounts? Here's why we think this would result in a terrible outcome.

* **Increased power of social media companies over users:** It would undermine the right to privacy in several ways. At present we can only visualise a few, and as we very well know with technology based policy interventions, the outcomes are often much worse and the threats only multiple when user rights are not considered at the outset. For instance, it would allow social media companies to gather deeper, more granular information about their users. A government ID, especially one such as Aadhaar which has a common identifier would permit them to link the personal data on the social media platform more easily. This would result in more pervasive dossiers of social media users available to the highest bidder who can serve us then with ads across platforms. Not to mention it would also increase the harms to speech by chilling dissenting voices.
* **Troubling legality:** This also becomes troubling neatly on the legality of the proposal. As per us, the private use of Aadhaar remains problematic as indicated by the Hon'ble Supreme Court. This becomes incredibly dangerous when it is mandatorily linked to our social media accounts. All this is happening while we are still governed by deficient safeguards, that were devised for telephone tapping applied to digital surveillance by the government. In a related matter to reform the safeguards for government surveillance (which is at present occurring without any judicial oversight) we have made a constitutional challenge through a petition in the Supreme Court of India by filing *Internet Freedom Foundation v. Union of India* (W.P. (C). No. 44/2019) \[Soon coming up for hearing on July 2, 2019\].
* **Increased risk to minors and women:** Linking real world identities may counter intuitively also contribute to the spreading of misinformation, abuse and threats which not only result in a direct attack against our democracy but also allows for individualised harms which more often come through to women and children. Women (other persons as well, especially individuals from vulnerable groups) in India quite often have adopted pseudonyms on social media to avoid censure from family, acquaintances or wider social judgement. Linking their Aadhaar to their social media accounts would tremendously increase informational risks even rising to the level of threats to their physical security.

### /// A short statement on today's developments

IFF's executive director, Apar Gupta stated that, ""*We are grateful to the Hon'ble Madras High Court for permitting us to make submissions given the vexed issues of Aadhaar and social media linking. This was possible due to the submissions of our counsel Suhrith Parthasarthy who is advising and representing us in this case. He also indicated the larger issues before the court on which we plan to engage in future hearings. Given the pervasive use of social media in our lives and the existing tools to harvest and utilise data for marketing purposes, not to mention, individualised advertisements, the entire gathering of personal data itself has been a constant cause for concern in the law few years. Adding Aadhaar to this cocktail for the purpose of verification of identity would arguably create further harm. This case also concerns issues of online abuse, misinformation which can contribute to challenges to social order and when law enforcement is deficient, even violence. Hence, the Hon'ble Court has also in recent hearings been considering issues of intermediary liability and end-to-end encryption. On all these issues, IFF's staff will work with care to ensure submissions are made to safeguard and protect the digital rights of every social media user in India.*""

In continuance with IFF's mission -- we will keep approaching courts in a systematic and planned manner to ensure the protection of the fundamental rights of every India.

Transparency is a hallmark in all of IFF's work. Hence, as with all our filed case pleadings even a copy of the intervention application is made public and is available in the link below. The next date for hearing in this case is July 26, 2019.

"Demolishing Some LCA Tejas Falsehoods _""The Tejas is an old design. It has taken 32 long years to develop! And despite being in development for so long, it isn't truly indigenous. Its heart, the engine, is of foreign origin. So are its weapons and some avionics. Furthermore, it is so deficient in its performance, that the Indian Air Force (IAF) wants Rafales/Su-30MKIs/F-16s instead.""_

Every time the Tejas achieves some important milestone, these criticisms are repeated ad nauseum, in the popular media, on Twitter, on internet forums, and at bhel-puri stalls in Jhumritalaiyya. It's infuriating to see an effort of this magnitude, one that has produced [many successes](http://www.ibnlive.com/blogs/india/saurav-jha/the-radiance-of-tejas-a-bright-prospect-for-make-in-india-10879-748651.html), being panned time and again. So I've taken the liberty to put together this handy-dandy LCA Tejas mythbusting guide to counter them.

And without wasting your time any further, I'll jump right in.

**False Argument 1: The Tejas is ""late"". It has been under development for 32 years!**

The figure is technically true, but deprives the narrative of much-needed context. The Tejas’ origins can indeed be traced back to 1983, when the concept of a Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) was conceived. However, the IAF did not finalise its air staff requirements (ASRs) until 1985 and initial funding did not come through until 1986. The project definition phase—the phase in which technical requirements are defined and a conceptual design prepared did not end until 1988. The final design was completed in 1990. Full funding was issued only in 1993, after which the development of a prototype commenced in earnest. See [this list of milestones](http://www.tejas.gov.in/history/milestones.html) for reference.

Following several years of delay in the development process—delays that can at least partly be traced back to overly optimistic R&D timeline projections, scope creep, and [US sanctions on India](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-05-31/news/39655783_1_drdo-chief-v-k-saraswat-lca-project) following the 1998 nuclear tests—the Tejas had its first flight in 2001. From then, the project proceeded at a pace that is not too different that of comparable fighter aircraft development programmes worldwide. It is slated to achieve final operational clearance (FOC), the stage at which an aircraft is considered fully ready for squadron service, in early 2017; fifteen years from the date of the first flight. At this time, the it is expected to be ready to carry out multiple functions: beyond visual range (BVR) air-to-air combat, short-range dogfighting, and precision ground attack with a variety of guided and unguided weaponry.

That compares well with contemporary fourth-generation fighters like the Eurofighter Typhoon and the JAS-39 Gripen. The first technology demonstrator of what would later be called the Typhoon first flew [in 1986](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Eurofighter_Typhoon). The definitive version with an AESA radar is [still not in service today](https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/euroradar-nears-flight-test-phase-for-captor-e-on-ty-416564/), 30 years down the line. The Tranche-2 version, which can drop precision bombs and fire BVR missiles, wasn't available [until 2008](http://www.raf.mod.uk/equipment/typhoon.cfm). Another European fighter, the Swedish Gripen-C, with full-spectrum capabilities, started entering service in 2002, also fourteen years after its first flight. 

The Tejas is about to FOC with all of these capabilities in late 2016. The fact that ADA managed to achieve similar or better timelines with the Tejas after its first flight, that too without the benefit of half a century of experience in building advanced fighters or the industrial ecosystem that enables such high-technology to proceed swiftly, is an achievement that is not given enough credit.

**False Argument 2: Because of the inordinate delays in development, the Tejas is now deficient.**

Just because the development was delayed doesn't mean that the design is the same one from 1983. The IAF updated its requirements quite often and kept demanding additional capabilities throughout the design and development phase. It was a Catch-22 situation: the constant change in requirements kept the design up-to-date, but it also led to several years of delays because of the need to re-design, re-test, and re-certify subsystems after every modification. Off the top of my head, I can remember that the IAF demanded the following modifications pretty late into the program:

* Open avionics architecture.
* Precision bombing capabilities.
* Heavier A2A missiles (R-73 vs R-60).
* Internal EW suite that included a self-protection jammer.
* Inflight refueling
* More capable radar and missiles (LCA Mk-1A)

With these modifications, the Tejas went from being a simple point-defence interceptor to a full-blown (albeit short-legged) multi-role fighter. 

**False Argument 3: The LCA falls short on several performance parameters like empty weight, range, turn rates, etc. The IAF has allowed 53 concessions/permanent waivers in the design.**

Like the 32-year delay, this too is a scary looking quote that paints a false picture of how fighter aircraft programmes work.

First off, it is important to remember that the Tejas can carry out most of the tasks intended of it quite competently. It can fight other aircraft at beyond visual range (when equipped with an AESA radar and Derby/Derby-ER missiles, it could end up becoming _the most capable_ BVR platform in IAF service). The addition of an Israeli helmet-mounted sight coupled to missiles whose seekers have a wide field of view (R-73 and Python IV/V) make it a fearsome dogfighter and compensate for minuscule shortfalls in aerodynamic performance. It can drop laser-guided bombs on ground targets with great precision. It is also very easy to fly. [In the words of the IAF](http://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/air-force-drdo-pleased-with-tejas-performance-at-bahrain-116022200321_1.html), the fighter’s ""control harmony is comparable to the best in the world… The intuitive cockpit layout and highly reliable life support systems provide for comfort as well as excellent situational awareness."" There are many such triumphs; too many, in fact, to recount here.

Secondly, _every_ fighter project concludes with specifications that aren't met, or a few deficiencies in performance. It’s never that big of a roadblock to induction in service. And all said and done, 53 is a very small number as far as design concessions go; a pretty small portion of the entire range of capabilities. Even simpler aircraft (like the [C-17]( http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19910528&slug=1285732)) enter service with more deficiencies. These are either compensated with using improvements in other areas to offset performance shortfalls, or accepted in the interest of availability for combat. 

Again, I shall go back to the Eurofighter Typhoon to illustrate my point. Remember I mentioned that it first flew in 1986? Twenty-two years later, it [couldn't independently drop a laser-guided bomb](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/07/01/eurofighter_austere_air_to_ground_what_joy/) on a target with any precision. Basic BVR combat capability was not available until Tranche 2 models were procured [in 2008](http://www.raf.mod.uk/equipment/typhoon.cfm), 14 years after the first flight. Even in close air combat, its capabilities were decidedly limited. The helmet mounted sight (HMS)—a system that allows the pilot to cue weapons onto an enemy aircraft by simply turning his head and offers a quantum jump in dogfighting capabilities—did not enter service [until 2010](https://www.eurofighter.com/about-us).

The F-35 was hobbled by similar issues (and terrible program management) [for several years](http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2013/09/joint-strike-fighter-lockheed-martin). It didn't begin to turn a corner until 2012 or so, after which it began rapidly demonstrating some of the capabilities that were expected of it.

The companies running these projects were aero giants with decades of experience behind them. How then does one expect the ADA, which has never developed a fighter in its entire existence, to deliver a more capable product while experiencing fewer failures? 

Thirdly, the IAF itself works with deficient designs all the time. The Gnat and Su-7, both hobbled by short ranges and limited payloads, were procured in large numbers. The MiG-21, when initially inducted, was underwhelming. Its range was limited and its missiles didn't work. The Bison is still riddled with issues. The Jaguar had a deficient nav-attack suite. It was practically useless in the long range strike role until the IAF and HAL developed and implemented the [DARIN upgrades](https://tkstales.wordpress.com/2010/03/07/the-darin-story/). The MiG-27's navigation system [never performed satisfactorily](http://www.livefistdefence.com/2010/07/special-report-story-of-indias-mig-27.html), and its reliability was terrible. But none of this troubled the IAF. Why then is the LCA failing to achieve a handful design parameters something to raise a huge hue and cry about?


**False Argument 4(a): The LCA isn't really indigenous. Many of its subsystems are of foreign origin.**

But many more of its critical subsystems are of Indian origin too! The first one that comes to mind is the carbon-fibre composite airframe. It is a very high-end product that reduces weight (thus permitting the carriage of a substantial external payload), aids maintenance, brings down manufacturing time, and so on. The fact that some of the technology involved in its manufacture has been exported to Airbus is a testament to its success.

Another example is the digital fly-by-wire (FBW) system, developed from scratch by ADA scientists in India after their work, notes, and equipment was impounded by Lockheed Martin in 1998. No country on earth, not one, has developed such a complex system and gotten it to work perfectly on the first try. It works so well that when it was first tested on an F-16XL in the US (this was before the nuclear tests), it improved the test-bed's handling qualities in several flight regimes. There is a reason the Tejas' test pilots call the aircraft to fly.

There are many other examples. The avionics. The mission computers. The navigation equipment, displays, and human-machine interface. The EW systems. This stuff isn't trivial by any yardstick.

Now coming to the foreign components aboard the aircraft. With the exception of the Americans, and to an extent the Russians, _every_ country has used foreign subsystems extensively in its aircraft designs. The [Gripen](http://www.airframer.com/aircraft_detail.html?model=JAS_39_Gripen) has an American engine, a British airframe design, Swiss carbon-fibre, an Italian radar, an American flight control system, a cockpit with critical components purchased from Britain, and so on. This in spite of the Swedes having an industrial base that is far more advanced than India's and extensive experience developing cold-war fighters such as the Draken and Gripen. The Rafale and Typhoon both use American ejection seats. Their flight control system uses actuators from Moog, an American company. The Russians were buying [Damocles pods](https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/russian-fighters-to-use-thales-damocles-targeting-pods-220747/) for the Su-35s before the French stopped military exports after they invaded Crimea. Nearly every Chinese fighter in service today uses a Russian engine, a Russian ejection seat, and a slew of Russian weaponry. If these aircraft all qualify as ""indigenous"", then surely the Tejas does too?

The choice that Indian design agencies faced was quite stark: should they have tried to build every little component in-house, thus reinventing the wheel at every step? Or used technologies/sub-systems available easily in the market in the initial stages and then made an attempt to indigenise over the life-cycle of the product? It's obvious that the latter was the more sensible path to take.

In the final analysis, the Tejas is an aircraft that has been designed by Indians in India, and is tailored to Indian requirements. If that doesn't make it indigenous, I don't know what does.
	

**False Argument 4(b): Okay, I get that. But the aircraft's very heart, its engine, is fully imported! Surely it's an utter failure on that front?**

Yes and no. It has had a very protracted development cycle, and for good reason. A jet engine is arguably represents the pinnacle of modern technology, making it the most challenging system in the world to develop from scratch. It has to produce ungodly amounts of power for its size and operate at the very edge of what physics allows. The GE F404—which ended up replacing the Kaveri on the LCA—weighs just a shade over 1000 kg and develops close to 80 kN of wet thrust. Assuming that it propels the LCA to Mach 0.9 at sea level (1,100 km/h), it's developing about 24,400 kW or 32,700 hp. That's 32 hp per kg. In contrast, a Formula-1 car engine generates ""only"" 8 or 9 hp per kg, and it's about as far as one can get with piston engines.

What does it take to generate so much power? One needs critical components like turbine blade assemblies that see inlet temperatures of 1,400°C or so while being subject to extreme forces. A back-of-the envelope calculation using rectally extracted figures tells me that a single high pressure turbine blade weighing 50 gm, and rotating at 16,000 RPM at the end of a 500 mm diameter disk, will be subject to a centrifugal force of about 3,500 kgf. Imagine two Honda Civics hanging off a tiny blade that is about as large as two of your fingers held together. There is a transverse load component as well; the 80 kN of thrust is distributed over the turbine blades. 

In order to sustain such loads, exotic materials and precision manufacturing techniques are required. Steel melts at about 1400°C, and starts rapidly losing strength at less than 500°C, so it's obviously not an option. Modern engines instead use nickel-based superalloys. Moreover, the material can't simply be cast or forged or machined into shape. The blade has to be produced via directional solidification or grown out of a single crystal in what looks more like a lab than a production shop. The shape, too, is very intricate. There are internal channels that route cold air taken from the compressor to the surface of the blade to keep it cool.

The fan, compressor, combustor, gearbox assemblies, bearings ... they're just as complex. And they all have to be precision manufactured to ensure that microscopic imbalances don't end up leading to excessive vibrations that could end up destroying the engine and the aircraft while in flight. Then there are requirements like safety, fuel efficiency, minimum total technical life, and reliability that add multiple layers of complexity to the design.

Now imagine the magnitude of effort required to develop something like this, with practically zero infrastructure and very little in terms of  a pre-existing knowledge base. And with skinflint bureaucrats refusing to approve requests for funding, test equipment, or manufacturing tools without documentation being submitted in triplicate and subject to audit after audit.

Now let us talk costs. The GTRE spent [Rs. 2,000 crore](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/rs-2101-crore-spent-on-development-of-indigenous-kaveri-engine-heres-why-theres-been-a-delay/articleshow/48282481.cms), or approximately $640 million in equivalent US dollars (with all the exchange rate and inflation variations that happened between 1989 and now taken into account), on developing the Kaveri. This seems like a lot, until you see that advanced nations spend billions on such programmes, and they almost never develop clean-sheet designs. They are always building on existing knowledge and existing designs. 

[Jeff Immelt, the CEO of GE says](http://www.businessinsider.com/interview-with-ge-ceo-jeff-immelt-on-transforming-ge-2015-12), ""If you could make something with 60 people in a garage, GE shouldn't be doing it. But if you make a jet engine, there's only like one and a half people in the world that can make a jet engine. And we are really good at that. If you want to compete with that, you've got to put yourself on a wayback machine and go back 25 years and invest $1 billion here for 25 years and then _maybe, just maybe_ [emphasis mine], you're going to be able to compete with us.""

Think about that for a second. It requires 25 years. And a billion dollars. And then too, you're more likely to fail than succeed.

The Chinese have been pouring money and espionage resources into their jet engine development efforts (they have budgeted [300 billion yuan](http://www.reuters.com/article/uk-china-engine-idUSLNE89T00W20121030)—about 45 billion in today's US dollars—over the next 20 years on engine programs alone), and are still facing [significant hurdles](http://www.reuters.com/article/uk-china-engine-idUSLNE89T00W20121030). Why do people feel that India would get significant results by spending just a few thousand crores?

In any case, the Kaveri isn't a complete write off. A naval derivative, the [Kaveri Marine Gas Turbine](http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/built-for-air-force-kaveri-engine-chosen-by-navy-109090800089_1.html) may end up powering Indian Navy vessels. It is also under consideration to [power an Indian UAV](http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/now-kaveri-engine-to-power-indigenous-uav-115073001650_1.html). 

There are civilian spin-offs too. For example, Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL) [now uses](http://www.drdo.gov.in/drdo/English/DRDO_BROCHURE_2015.pdf) the investment casting technology developed by GTRE for manufacturing blades for gas turbines used in power generation.

**False Argument 5: In a globalised world, there is no point re-inventing the wheel. The IAF should simply dump it and buy the Gripen/F-16/MiG-35**

What is true for cell phones or cars isn’t true for military equipment. In the long run, in peace and in war, the IAF would be best served by fielding fighters designed and built in India. That's the only way it will equip itself with a large fleet on a (relatively) small budget. There are other advantages to developing the technology in-house: less dependence on foreign suppliers, leading to increased strategic independence. Creation of a stronger local economy and industrial ecosystem. The freedom to tinker with the design and optimise it to suit local requirements without running afoul of IP agreements with the OEM. Spin-offs in the civilian world. And so on and so forth. And if going indigenous is indeed the way forward, then the IAF will have to live with fielding under-performing/problematic designs at the beginning. It will have to make peace with the fact that aerospace R&D is a slow, painful process that is fraught with risk.

That's how practically everyone else did it. The Chinese did not seek out the latest and greatest toy because their initial designs (Q-5, JH-7, J-8, J-10) failed to match up to what the US, Japan, and India fielded. If the J-10B and J-20 are flying today, it is only because the PLAAF and PLAN flew inferior aircraft for decades while their industrial capabilities matured. As it is, the Tejas program's achievements have been quite impressive: the country has developed a fourth-generation fighter that is as good as the Gripen-C from scratch. It uses more home-grown technology than the Gripen does; including such critical subsystems like the digital FBW, the composite airframe, a large portion of the avionics, etc. Many of these have been applied to the IAF's legacy aircraft as upgrade packages. To throw it all away because of a handful of challenges here and there or because Lockheed or Boeing are offering to transfer their manufacturing lines to India would be incredibly, utterly stupid. If the Tejas is cancelled, we will have a repeat of the same thirty-year saga the next time India tries to build her own fighter.

"Is the most pathetic thing about Hindu-Nationalists their subservience to White-Supremacists? If you go onto right wing social media circles you find countless conspiracy theories that are pretty much copy/pasted from cesspools like Stormfront or /Pol/, many about how the “Soros” funded left wing media is unfairly critical of right-wing ideologies or how the mere existence “Radical Islamic terrorism” is justification enough to impose indiscriminate violence against Muslims. 

Under any one of Donald Trumps tweets you will find hoards of Indians venerating him and congratulating him for his policies against Muslims or celebrating his friendship with Modi. 

And the wave of anti-Chinese bigotry, perpetrated by racist whites in response to the coronavirus, has swept up India in such a frenzy that even Indian North-easterners are not safe from attacks and harassment due to having oriental features. 

There is such a innate desire for Hindu-nationalists to make sure that they are on the same side of every issue as white supremacists as both of them see their own community as being inherently better than the rest and therefore united in their contempt for the rest.

But the one key difference between the two groups is all of this ethno-nationalist bravado projected by the Indian government and its Hindu-nationalist supporters falls to the wayside when Donald Trump threatens retaliation against India for putting its own self interest before that of the white supremacists.

It’s almost as if they have accepted their status as being above the Chinese, the Muslims, etc but subconsciously they have accepted the rule of the white man over them. 

It’s not a surprise that over the course of his tenure, as India tries to contort and bend to appease him, Donald Trump treats India with almost a sense of restrained contempt.

“If they were to disallow the drug from being exported to the US there maybe be retaliation, off course there would be retaliation” - On Hydrochloroquine

“Tariff King"" - On India’s local industries 

While the barrage of pettiness and hate, that is reserved for countries like Bangladesh, Malaysia, Turkey and others in India’s more immediate neighborhood, is released the moment any of them dare to say something slightly critical of India, somehow this strong and aggressive Hindu-nationalist government almost always just cowers down to the US and complies accordingly to all their threats and requests. And it’s not as if they do it begrudgingly, their supporters continue to revere and look at the White House as a friend and well wisher.",Coronavirus

"Need for a change of school culture and the hype around class 10th and 12th board exams I am currently a Ph.D. in Biology student at a university in the United States of America. I completed my class 10th in 2006, and my class 12th in 2008. I scored 78.3% and 72% in the aforementioned board exams, respectively. During my school years, I was never a meritorious student. I was rather among the bottom 40-50% of students from my class section academically. However, I worked really hard for my class 10th board exam and was deeply affected by the final percentage I scored. I did pretty well in the mock exams that I used to give at the private tuition center I took to help my academic performance and scored much more than many of friends majority of whom ended up scoring more than 85% in the final board examination.

&#x200B;

Till my class 10th, I studied at a prestigious public school in Delhi. As per the school's rule, a student could only be offered Science, if he/she scored more than 80% in English, Science, and Mathematics combined. My score was 77.7%, and therefore, was offered humanities and commerce. The rule didn't make sense as I scored 94% in Science, and my mathematics scores were always among the top 5-15% of the high scoring students in my section.  Therefore, I changed schools to study Science, and today I am earning a top-most degree in a field in which my school thought I was not a good fit.

&#x200B;

I suffered from depression and lack of confidence before my class 10th. I used to be good at cricket, but I suffered in that as well. My school carried a culture where if you are not good academically, then you are hopeless in other extra-curricular activities as well. I wanted to do academically well in school (prior to my class 10th), but the lack of confidence made it really difficult to come out of the shell and raise myself to glory (yes, being a good student did seem like a glory). I was so terrified that I would be scared to even open my textbooks.

&#x200B;

Not being able to get Science made things worse. I lost even more hope, and this worsened my mental health for my class 12th board exam. I remember praying to score at least more than 60% a night before the results. But, today if I could talk to my younger self, my recommendation would be to not lose hope and enjoy doing what you like. However, I still not sure if the environment that I lived would help. In my school days, I was compelled to feel like an outlaw for being among the bottom 40-50% of students from my class section.

&#x200B;

Recently, an article came out on Hindu, about a mother congratulating her son for scoring 60% in class 10th. She says that she had seen her son struggle to the point of giving up, and therefore, was proud of the final scores he got. In my time, my parents were also in full support of me. So was my father, who had always been strict. My father would never come to the parents-teachers meeting, as I was not up to the standards he expected of me. But, after my class 10th, he was very supportive and backed me at every point possible. Getting this sort of support from this person was huge for me then. He tried his level best to make a case to my school principal as to why I deserve to be a science student for the last two years of schooling. But, I remember walking down the school corridor with my parents trying to make a last attempt to convince my school principal, I met my Geography teacher. She congratulated me sarcastically and ridiculed me (in front of my parents) of how bad of a student I was before. It has been 13 years since that gesture, but the instance is still registered in my memory from word to word.

&#x200B;

Therefore, this makes me wonder, whether how much of a support system would your parents be if you have such teachers and cultures inculcated in schools. At that time, my parent's support didn't help me much. In fact, it made me feel even more horrible for being responsible for letting them go through such tough situations. Manier times. especially I like to believe in my case, low scores in class 10th are due to a stroke of sheer bad luck. But, the impact is grave for a naive 16-year-old.

&#x200B;

The point I am trying to make is that in addition to having a good support system from one's parents, the school's culture of dealing with young students needs to change. Teachers have a big responsibility of training future entrepreneurs, engineers, researchers etc, and therefore need to pay proper regard to a students self-esteem and self-confidence. What might just seem to be a simple comment (and here I don't include the personal issues that teacher might sometime have) the repercussions on the student's mental health might be huge.

&#x200B;

Ironically, I got to know about this below-given news article from the same geography teacher's Facebook post. She was cheering this wonderful mother for her attempt to lift the pressure off the head of her son' young mind. I first felt like commenting directly about the hypocrisy she has shown to me at the least. But, I think I should probably try to let this memory go of my head and move on.

**#Brexit Update**

This isn’t the first time that a Brexit story is here, and it’s certainly not going to be the last. The Brexit referendum is the European news media’s Donald Trump - they’re going to milk the story for all it’s worth for years to come. The country is attempting a preemptive strike against the economic downturn that all the prophecies have predicted now that it is moving out of EU. Accordingly, the UK finance minister has [announced](http://in.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-osborne-idINKCN0ZJ0VN) plans to cut corporate tax rates from 20% to 15%. For some context, most developed countries average a corporate tax rate of 25%, India taxes at 35%. As the UK’s currency fell to 31-year lows in the foreign exchange markets, the Bank of England (UK’s central bank) [eased](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/05/bank-of-england-releases-150bn-pounds-risks-financial-stability) regulations on banks which freed up £150 billion that banks can lend to people and businesses. How does any of this relate to India? UK’s Business Secretary Sajid Javid (who sports a forehead that rivals that of Sonakshi Sinha’s) is [going](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/brexit-india-uk-to-hold-trade-talks/article8823969.ece) on a world tour of nations including India to hold discussions about a possible trade treaty. Seriously, google him right now. His head is more forehead than face. 

**LPT: Don’t Be Hungry In Kerala**

Incredible India is all good, but have you tasted the food here? Clearly, India is a fat man’s paradise. If you leave out Kerala, that is. The state just [imposed](http://food.ndtv.com/food-drinks/fat-tax-introduced-in-kerala-14-5-to-be-levied-on-fast-food-chains-like-mcdonalds-1429427) a 14.5% tax on food that makes you fatter, like burgers, pizzas, sandwiches, donuts etc. While subsidies are often used to encourage consumption of certain things, on the flip side, taxes are often used to discourage consumption of certain things. And Kerala’s government just wants to discourage fat people from being fat. The move is expected to bring in additional revenue of ₹10 crore to the state while mostly affecting fast food chains like McDonalds, Subway, Pizza Hut etc. The idea of a ‘fat tax’ is nothing new - it’s been implemented in countries like Denmark and Hungary, a country that sounds a lot like hungry. Coincidence? Definitely, yeah.

**Banks: Desperate Times, Desperate Measures**

Months after the banks started drowning in a pool of bad loans, the water level has come up enough to inspire some desperate deals. The nation’s second largest lender, ICICI had loaned ₹3,000 crore to Essar Steel, the Ruia-family owned company. But Essar has fallen on pretty hard times and can’t pay the loans back. So the banks got together and started searching for someone who can buy a majority stake in Essar, takeover the management and turn the company around. But it’s all fun and games until reality sets in - which is that nobody wants to even touch Essar Steel with a ten-foot pole. Last week, realizing that a solution was unlikely, ICICI [sold](http://www.livemint.com/Industry/8CVTPujGZTeE2W7iBUr45M/ICICI-Bank-sells-Essar-Steel-loan-exposure-to-Edelweiss-ARC.html) those loans worth about ₹1,600 crore to Edelweiss. The Jaypee Group, known perhaps for its cement business, found itself in similar condition where it had borrowed just a little more than it could handle. Fortunately, somebody did touch that company with a ten-foot pole. The company [sold](http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/buzzing-stocks/jp-associates-ultratech5-38rs-16189-cr-cement-deal_6982041.html) a lot of cement manufacturing plants to UltraTech Cement for ₹16,189 crore that it can potentially use to repay loans. To consolidate in times of trouble, State Bank of India is merging with its associate banks from Travancore, Mysore and others. But along with employees who fear being fired after the merger, a lot of businesses that are customers of the banks being acquired are [protesting](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/money-and-banking/now-customers-too-voice-concern-over-sbi-associate-banks-merger/article8807858.ece) the merger. Why? Well, how would you like it if your local grocery shopkeeper who knows you by name suddenly sold out to Big Bazaar?

**Loans From Flipkart**

The list of top 3 disasters in India goes like this: 1) the Bhopal Gas Tragedy, 2) Sholay-remake *Ram Gopal Verma Ki Aag* and 3) Flipkart’s Big Billion Day. The online retailer’s annual big sales event that comes every year started in 2014 and fetched the company ₹650 crore. But it was marred by failure in shipping which resulted in thousands of frustrated customers, and the company has been trying to rebuild the Big Billion Day brand ever since. The second Big Billion Day happened last year, raked in ₹2,000 crore for the company and sailed through relatively easily. This time, however, Flipkart feels shaky on being able to deliver without a glitch. It’s [making](http://thetechportal.com/2016/07/05/flipkart-brings-back-big-billion-day-major-changes/) plans to have a one huge Big Billion Day in the first week of October, followed by similar smaller events to spread the orders around. At a time when banks are becoming more cautious about lending to certain sectors of the economy, Flipkart is also planning to play matchmaker between banks and borrowers by offering pre-approved loans so you can buy now, pay later. The company is in talks with banks to arrange the loans which will be paid back by Flipkart in case people just decide to run with their Flipkart-bought flat screens and laptops.

"I just hate it when indian parents compare their children to so called ( Sharma ji ke bete) One hour ago, my family relative and his son visited my house. Their son was leaving India for pursue MBA! 
After they left, my mother started comparing me to her. She always does that, but today I felt extreme anger and frustration and started to think about few things. I admit I am 21 and have some intellectual issues. I am slow and can't learn things. I never do simple tasks properly. I can't organise or take care of myself. Due to such things I isolate myself more and more to a point I don't sleep for 2 days and stay in my room talking to myself and crying!

My grandpa was an imbecile and same goes for my grandma. My father died in 2003 in an accident! He barely got educated and we were lower middle class.

I inherited their INTELLIGENCE, LOOKS and SKILLS. They need to understand some people are just born losers and don't have any skills or talent.  Dumbness and stupidity runs here in our family.

"Some village chanting ancient language, request. I remember years ago reading about a village in perhaps the South-west of India that is known for an ancient chant.


That is to say the village holds phonetic instructions on how to sing a ritual chant in a long forgotten and dead language. In turn, every year they hold a little festival in the jungle and sing the chant as it's been instructed.

"Disappointing startup environment here in India As the title suggests, although there are some really good (supposedly) government initiatives on incubating infant startups but I haven't once come across a discussion thread related to startups in this subreddit. So I was wondering if you've a startup or did and it failed for some reason or the other, how was the experience? What lessons did you learn from it? Do you've plans for another one? What were some bureaucratic hurdles you have faced and how are you supposed to tackle them?

A fact that caught me by surprise was that the IT sector contributes 7.7% to the GNP which definitely correlates to the fact that the tech environment in the country isn't as impotent as suggested by various reports. Agreed that a significant portion of the software engineers are in need of a major reskilling but look at the bigger picture. India is a country of 1.3Bn people and out of it, for a small section of the populace who are into IT, to contribute close to 8% of the \~3Tn economy is damn huge! 

Considering this, it's hard to believe that, not even one of those millions strong IT workforce failed to come up with a noble and most importantly a sustainable business of his/her own. Anyway, that's just my opinion from looking at certain statistics and although numbers rarely lie but sometimes fail to portray a bigger picture of an underlying issue.

I'm looking to having an open discussion here and if it works out maybe I could try out a scheduled discussion thread on startups, to discuss everything from ideas to official procedures, etc. So tell me more about your startup(s) and help me understand the startup scenario better in this country.",Scheduled

"Jio Giga Fiber - Speed issues Hey guys !

So I have been using the Jio Giga Fiber for more than a year. 

My basic use is streaming (Netflix, Prime, Hotstar etc.) and downloading via torrents and some debrid sites (alldebrid/real debrid/premiumize.me etc). 

Till about 2-3 weeks back, I was getting consistent speeds of 90 mbps+ on almost all sites, with no throttling whatsoever. 

About 2 weeks back, I noticed that speeds on torrents and debrid sites has fallen to 15-20 mbps. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Changed DNS (cycled between Google, Cloudfare and Jio) to no use

\- Bought subs to different debrid sites, and the speeds are consistent (about 3 MBps) on all sites (and torrents)

\- Speedtest to Indian servers on [Speedtest.net](https://Speedtest.net) shows 100 mbps connection, same with Netflix (local CDNs I guess)

\- Speedtest to foreign servers (Singapore, HK etc) shows speeds of 10-20 mbps, with high pings

&amp;#x200B;

I also have an Airtel broadband connection - 40 mbps. I tried the same links with Airtel, and they max out the connection within seconds, so most likely the issue is with Jio. 

&amp;#x200B;

Did a tracert to some of the debrid sites for both Jio and Airtel. Airtel showed 6 hops, Jio 12 hops. 

&amp;#x200B;

I called Jio's CC and they basically said as long as ANY server shows 100 mbps speeds, they cannot do anything and they do not have a way to escalate it further. 

&amp;#x200B;

Checked with a friend who stays about 4-5 kms away, in a different society and uses Jio. He is facing the same issue.

"Broke up 30! What next??? Hi Everyone,

I browse through reddit quite a bit and love the answers and support that comes especially under relationships/life.So here goes my story.

A little about myself. I'm 30 yr old Indian woman working in IT and earning well. I am the only kid and my mother raised me as a single parent after my dad left us.She has raised me to be independent and has given me freedom unlike other Indian families.

I had my share of relations when I was young and I was single for a considerable amount of time in mid 20's and I made good use of it. I started traveling and over years have come to love it. Travel opened doors for me in blogging and photography and my friends say I am decent at both. Being single also taught me value of friendships and I'm fortunate to have made some solid bonds over the years.

I met my bf (32 yrs) two years ago and with time we realized we do want to spend our lives together. As we started talking about future I realized that my bf is very keen to move to his hometown and take over his family business/ agriculture (he mentioned it casually once a yr ago. I had no idea he was serious about it).  I refused to agree for this as it is hard for me to relocate to a place which has zero opportunities for career. I hate the idea of staying at home or being dependent for finances. For the reasons above and also that I would be giving up all my friends,leaving my mom,work, travel everything for one person seemed like a bad deal.

We tried to come up with solutions but none of them made of us happy and hence agreed for mutual breakup. This breakup has left bitter feelings in me about everything. I want to stop feeling negative about my ex (somewhere I feel he could have stayed considering he has been staying in the city for 20+ yrs) and stop feeling sad for myself. I am scared that I might end up alone given the age taboo/caste etc in India and quite not sure how to deal with all the negativity in my head.Any suggestions are welcome!

Thanks,

Ablahnaari!

"I’m fed up with the aviation industry in India. Up until the start of this year I used to fly only on Jet, unless circumstances dictated otherwise. 
I rarely travelled on Indigo, Spice or GoAir. 
Fuck man I miss jet and more importantly I’m pissed at this shithole of an industry. The low cost model has almost conclusively destroyed the scope for any other form of air travel. There is Vistara but it hardly services the destinations that indigo and spice do, and not as frequently either. 
I flew on spice yesterday and it’s safe to say that it ranks high on my worst air travel experiences, and this includes having to sit at Mumbai airport because my KF flight was delayed twice due to technical difficulties. 
The seats were stiff is wood, and there was near zero space for legroom and a really shitty seat pitch. Cabin crew? Cold and unfriendly. 
Don’t even mention boarding. Whenever I fly from Chennai, check in at the indigo counter feels like I’m trying to board an unreserved compartment in a railway. Too many people too less counters, and an “only baggage drop” sign that’s basically a giant public fuck you to anybody who did a web check in. Indigo consistently ranks as the worst flying experience in India you could opt for. 
All I ask for is an airline that has a good legroom, a comfortable seat and decent food. Not to mention a boarding process that is hassle free. Why is it the we can’t have a decently premium airline like in Europe, America or even Asia? They all have low cost options(Ryan, Air Asia etc) but they all have premium airlines as well(Delta, KLM, Singapore etc). India has fuck all. I feel that due to the large middle class it caters to, the aviation industry has generalised and ended up eliminating the needs of a considerable class of flyers that have a sizeable disposable income. 
Then there’s also “why should I pay more when coach lands at the same time as first, aka my dad” like just fuck that attitude sometimes. People who travel for business and take same day/ two day flights would benefit from comfort so much. We shouldn’t have to be treated as degenerate travellers just cause we wanted to save a bit.",Non-Political

I think the same for the US that doesn't currently pay as much attention to soccer or cricket.  I think the hegemony of basketball, baseball and football need to be challenged and I wonder if it is time for the hegemony of cricket in India to be challenged. 

Can't force people to like things but providing lucrative alternatives my inspire the next generations to pursue other opportunities.  One thing about the US system is that opportunities are available for educational attainment at the college level through sports and not just through professional contracts.

"Will India (and our highly questionable work culture) benefit from a 4 days working \ 3 days weekly off schedule? This experiment has been adopted intermittently in many parts of the world across many companies - recently it found huge success in Japan at Microsoft:

"The confession of a pseudosecular October 31st, 1984. We heard about it from the senior students that Indira Gandhi was assassinated by her guards. The teacher told us after a couple of periods that we all had to go home. We were happy that we would not have to attend any more classes. Then he gave the reason. As he said that the Prime Minister of India was no more, most of the students pointed towards the only Sikh boy in the class and said, ""*Sir Sir, iske logon ne mara hai*"" (Sir Sir, this guy's people killed her). The thin little Sikh boy shrank in trepidation. All his friends were accusing him. We were children. We were really small children then, hardly 12 or 13 years old but we knew who belonged to which community, who was a Sikh and who was not. We knew who was a Hindu and who was a Muslim. I still remember what followed Indira Gandhi's assassination. It was bad but it was said that it was the punishment for killing Indira Gandhi and so it was okay. If it was okay for the elders, it was okay with me. 

Fast forward to 1988 -

""Can anyone tell me what is the national religion of our country?"", asked Mrs Gulati.

""Hinduism, Madam"", replied the class, almost in unison. I also said the same after scratching my head.

The withdrawn guy sitting in the last bench perhaps did not say anything and so Mrs. Gulati asked, ""Khurshid, what is the national religion of India?""

Hesitantly, Khurshid stood up, blinked his bespectacled eyes and said, ""Madam, Hinduism?""

""India is a secular country. There is no national or official religion"", said Mrs Gulati.

Class X Section A fell silent. We had no idea what was secular. It was a new word in our very limited English vocabulary. After the class ended, there was a buzz in the air. Who is secular? What is secular? When did India become secular? Are Hindus also secular? Now, when I look back to the days of 1988, I wonder why even the Christian, Sikh and Muslim students had no problem saying that the national religion of India was Hinduism. But the reasons were in front of my eyes. I just overlooked them. It did not occur to me that we chanted a Sanskrit sloka every day in the assembly. We celebrated Saraswati Puja in the school.  We were taught Ramayana and Mahabharata in the class. We studied Sanskrit instead of Urdu which was more widely spoken in India or any regional language which was more useful. Mrs Gulati's assertion that India was a secular country was just a flash in the pan. We heard the term, found it to be quite confusing and quickly forgot it. 

My personal understanding was that India was a Hindu country no matter if people wanted to call it secular. Secular was a fancy word educated people used. India was a Hindu country where others also lived. They were also Indians but they were the other Indians much like the platypus that was also a mammal but not exactly. The novel idea of secularism did not sink into my psyche for most of my age. The stereotypes did not let it happen. The Christian was either a priest with a big cross hanging from his neck or an alcoholic rolling on the beaches of Goa. The Sikh was the virtuous but not so smart alcohol-glugging, Bhangra-dancing semi-Hindu who said ""*Chak de phatte*"" with or without a reason. The Muslim was either the terrorist or the smuggler with a beard and a skull cap, who ate beef. No matter how many Sikhs, Christians and Muslims I came across in my younger days, the stereotype reigned supreme. It did not occur to me that there were more smugglers in India who were not Muslim. It did not dawn upon me that my father did not have to be a Sikh to be an alcoholic. It did not occur to me that LTTE fighters did not need to be Muslims to pioneer suicide bombing. 

My mother wore a new saree to go to the *mandap*. The loudspeakers blared vulgar Bollywood songs while children played and women queued up to pay homage to Devi Durga. My head throbbed with migraine. But I was not unhappy. Durga Puja comes once in a year. What is the harm if people have some fun. But I did not tell myself what was the harm if the loud *azaan* from the nearby mosque wake me up. ""These bloody Muslims! Can't they do their prayers without the loudspeakers? Secularism does not mean you wake up people before the dawn every day."". It is not like Durga Puja that noise pollution increases only for four days. I did not think that it was not just for four days that noise pollution increased. Kali Puja, Diwali, Laxmi Puja, Jaddhatri Puja, Dol (Holi), Janmasthami, Saraswati Puja, Shani Puja, Shiva Ratri, Vishwakarma Puja and every conceivable Puja resonated at the same decibel level and gave me a migraine. But India is a secular country and so people have the right to celebrate their festivals. My definition of secularism was a polymorphic virus. It changed its attributes and purpose. When the Babri mosque was demolished, I did not feel any pain or remorse. On the contrary, I sort of justified it to me by thinking that Babar was indeed a tyrant. It did not matter to me why Babar's being a tyrant should justify the demolition of a mosque more than 400 years after his death. I did not think about how I could not morally oppose the despicable act of thousands of hooligans and vandals. 

But as the years passed by, I became less and less of a typical uninformed and unaware Indian. I understood that secularism was not what was told to us. Secularism was not refraining from hurting others' religious sentiments. Secularism was the principle of separation between the state and the religious bodies. India was not a secular country. The state relentlessly and systematically pushed and propagated the religious sentiments of one community and it was my community. It took years but I realized that I was not secular. It takes time to change the stance. Sometimes it takes an event or an incident to change the stance.

""Go back to India. People will kill you here"", said the Chacha in Bengali. 

""Why? What happened?"", I asked.

""Hindus are killing Muslims in your country"", said Chacha, adding, ""Don't tell me later that I did not warn you. Go away tonight."".

My flight from Dhaka to Calcutta was still a week away. But I managed to get tickets and left Bangladesh that very evening without visiting my grandfather's ancestral village. It was the second night of the Gujarat pogrom. On the short flight, I cursed the Hindus of Gujarat for not letting me visit my ancestral village, the sudden fear of death I had to face, for running away like a fugitive for no crime of mine. For the first time, I felt a repugnance towards ""my people"". My people? How could those *Trishul* brandishing, *Jai Sri Ram* chanting vermins on a rampage be my people? What was common between me and those vectors of the disease of communal hatred? Wasn't that Chacha who warned me of the impending trouble ""my people"" instead? Yes, he was my people even though his nationality was different and his religion was different. A person cannot be my people just because his religion or his caste or his nationality are the same as mine.

By the time 2014 general election came, I was a proud secular. I hated the system that kept the Muslims backward by giving them a few subsidies and recognizing only the Mullahs as the representative of the community as much as I hated the burgeoning majoritarianism of the Hindus. Secularism had to be redefined. It can no longer be sucking up to the fundamentalist elements of society. It can no longer be catering to the whims of the religious filth of the country. But it was already too late. Indians were giving up all pretensions of being secular. The term ""secular"" was becoming a cussword. 

Today when I see the hooligans in Kanwar-yatra being showered with rose petals from helicopters by police officers, when I see food-fascism by banning beef, when I see Muslims being lynched for mere suspicion of possessing beef, when I see Muslims thrashed to death for no reasons, when I see lynchers being garlanded by Harvard educated ministers, when I see the dead body of an alleged lyncher draped in tri-colour, I feel that this country needs to be truly secular. That is the only way this country can survive. 

It was our collective negligence and deliberate misinterpretation of the word ""secularism"" that today the word has become dirty and we are a proto-religious regressive fascist country, instead of a secular socialist progressive democracy.  Our children, the future generation will curse us, spit on us for what we have done to our motherland. It is now our duty to bring this nation back from the brinks of ruination.",Politics

"Old Players I was remembering in this WC 19. In this world Cup, England become Champion first time ever since England is one who give birth to this game and they never won any World Cup Trophies. 

As every Indian Fan is sad about India get lose and Eliminated in Semi Final against New Zealand. 

But in this world cup I was Remembering some old players and imagining what If they were part of Current Team. 

##OLD MS DHONI. 

As everyone beloved Dhoni who maybe didn't bat at level fan expected but his contribution in planning making, experience and managing play big factor for India Qualify for Semi Final. 

But at some moments I was missing that Old 2011-14 Finisher Dhoni and 2000 Aggressive Dhoni and one of the moment was India match with England. When Dhoni come to Bat team needed Runs with run rate of almost 10 but surprisingly he leave First ball he faced. And even in Aadil Rashid over in which It was Expected that Dhoni will free his arms only get 5 runs in that Over. And he even stopped Pandya from hitting shorts who was making quick runs before Dhoni Come to play and they were not even trying to play any big shorts. 

That moment I was Imagining if It was Dhoni from 2011-14, even he plays some slow game but he definitely starts play big shorts in last 5-6 overs and match would be little closer. Or If It was 2000 Dhoni who is purely aggressive and hard hitter, combination of aggression of Pandya and 2000 Dhoni would definitely bring match close and possibly even ensure India Victory. 

##Rahul Dravid. 

Seriously we never got any alternate of ""Wall"" yet in current Team. We even got alternate of Sachin, we got better bowling attack, better Opening Pair, but we never got Alternate of Dravid. **When we need Opener, Dravid is there. we need finisher,  Dravid is there. We need any player who can stabilize innings, Dravid is there, when 4th day is in trouble, Dravid is there.** Complete package of Batsman was Dravid. 

In India Vs New Zealand Semi Final, India lost top 3 batsman just under score of 10 and 6 wickets just under score of 100. But Thanks to Jadeja and Dhoni who atleast prevent Shameful lose of India. 

But I was Imagining what If Dravid was playing this match. Seriously this guy is most Sensible, Reliable and trustable Batsman India ever got. If he was in this match then Dravid potentially could stabilize innings when Team was losing wickets and keep one side secure. 

Dravid is One I am missing most in Current Team India and It is sad to see we cannot replace him. ����������",Sports

 It has almost no government land holding but land is pooled from farmers and given developed plots. 85% of the land is in hands of  Chandra babus community .  Proponents say we will have our own Hyderabad and Bengaluru in 15 - 20 years and the city will be the economic lifeline .

"I am forwarding an interesting story about world economy. How valid is it? I leave it to you. Another whatsapp forward Amazing logic indeed. This is a crazy world! Interesting article written by an Indian Economist

Japanese save a lot. They do not spend much. Also, Japan exports far more than it imports. Has an annual trade surplus of over 100 billion. Yet Japanese economy is considered weak, even collapsing.

Americans spend, save little. Also US imports more than it exports.
Has an annual trade deficit of over $400 billion. Yet, the American economy is considered strong and trusted to get stronger.

But where from do Americans get money to spend? They borrow from Japan, China and even India.
Virtually others save for the US to spend. Global savings are mostly invested in US, in dollars.

India itself keeps its foreign currency assets of over $50 billion in US securities. China has sunk over $160 billion in US securities.
Japan's stakes in US securities is in trillions.

Result:
The US has taken over $5 trillion from the world. So, as the world
saves for the US - It's The Americans who spend freely. Today, to keep the US consumption going, that is for the US economy to work, other
countries have to remit $180 billion every quarter, which is $2
billion a day, to the US!

A Chinese economist asked a neat question. Who has invested more, US in China, or China in US? The US has invested in China less than half of what China has invested in US.

The same is the case with India. It have invested in US over $50
billion. But the US has invested less than $20 billion in India.

Why the world is after US?

The secret lies in the American spending, that they hardly save. In fact they use their credit cards to spend their future income. That the US spends is what makes it attractive to export to the US. So US imports more than what it exports year after year.

The result:

The world is dependent on US consumption for its growth. By its deepening culture of consumption, the US has habituated the world to
feed on US consumption. But as the US needs money to finance its consumption, the world provides the money.

It's like a shopkeeper providing the money to a customer so that the customer keeps buying from the shop. If the customer will not buy, the shop won't have business, unless the shopkeeper funds him. The US is like the lucky customer. And the world is like the helpless shopkeeper
financier.

Who is America's biggest shopkeeper financier? Japan of course. Yet it's Japan which is regarded as weak. Modern economists complain that
Japanese do not spend, so they do not grow. To force the Japanese to spend, the Japanese government exerted itself, reduced the savings
rates, even charged the savers. Even then the Japanese did not spend (habits don't change, even with taxes, do they?). Their traditional postal savings alone is over $1.2 trillion. Thus, savings, far from being the strength of Japan, has become its pain.

Hence, what is the lesson?

That is, a nation cannot grow unless the people spend, not save. Not just spend, but borrow and spend.
Dr. Jagdish Bhagwati, the famous Indian-born economist in the US, told Manmohan Singh that Indians wastefully save. Ask them to spend, on imported cars and, seriously, even on cosmetics! This will put India on a growth curve. This is one of the reason for MNC's coming down to India, seeing the consumer spending.

'Saving is sin, and spending is virtue.'
But before you follow this Neo Economics, get some fools to save so that you can borrow from them and spend !!!

"Contrasting logic behind CAA/NPR/NRC protest and Support. So this one time I was waiting for metro to arrive at the platform. This guard was talking to a college kid. He said ""Saale bahar se aake yaha do manjila ghar bana liye hain .. ab sabit karo .. show karna padega isiliye inki fati padi hai (for protestors)."" .. so I could not resist and intervene, asked him how would you prove your citizenship? he said I have adhaar PAN card etc. .. When I told him, this wouldn't work you would have to furnish the birth certificate of not only your’s, but your father’s, and every member of family .. he said I know some Vidhayak ji and went to this Bhokal attitude. I also asked him if he actually believes that landless labours in village and many people in rural areas would have any kind of paper to support their citizenship ?? and how much of corruption, scam would take place … He still kept on denying by presenting his Bhokal of knowing this Vidhayak and “sab nikalwa lunga”.

So the second logic I am presenting is, If PRO NPR/CAA/NRC guys argue that this law is for giving citizenship and not taking away, why do they so vehemently oppose **reservations**?!?!? Because it provides job to the needy and does not takes anyone’s job .. ask any BJP supporter out there and he’ll tell you how much he hates this reservation thing .. and yet he takes this contrasting stand when it comes to NRC/NPR/CAA.",CAA-NRC-NPR

"I made a embarrassing mistake while driving today and I hate myself for it. It was in the morning, a two lane road, there was a car going slow infront of me and there was traffic jam on our lane ahead, I decided to over take but realised too late that I wouldn't be able to make it back to my lane in time so , I was praying that the slow car would let me rejoin the lane, he didn't allow (he didn't do anything wrong), I was stuck on the other lane and just then few moments later there were cars coming on the other lane, and I was blocking them. I could see that the driver in the slow car was angry at me and was saying something, I tried to apologise by showing lifting my hand, don't know if he could see it since it was raining, I was trying to reverse to allow the other cars to pass but then the car behind started honking as well, I felt horrible. But then thank god the the cars started moving on the lane I was supposed to be and the car behind me allowed me to rejoin.  Must have been on the wrong lane for 1 to 2 minutes

I can't stop thinking about it, I feel really horrible. Don't feel like driving anymore. Dont feel like doing anything.",Non-Political

"Suggestions needed for a good mental health improving center.  

Hi all,

I need some advices/ suggestions.

My mom is having an issue with her mental health - following some traumatic experience from her childhood. Not violent but she is not able to forget them and she is reliving those moments on a daily basis. Imagine going through hellish events every day for last 45+ years!.

It messes her life so badly. she recognizes it sometimes and will ask us to take her to any psychiatrist and psychologists, but she will change her mind soon after that. We tried different medications and counsellings but nothing worked for long. Until recently we all managed to live our life without much trouble, but from last two years things are getting verse, doing strange things which i cannot explain here and started talking to almost everyone some imaginative stories but soon forgets about that. For someone outside she is perfectly normal and they are getting confused.

We are looking for some mental health improving centers,  or someplaces where she can stay for a bit - maybe a month or two - and get help, but not the normal mental hospitals please. We don't want her to be in a place with any violent patients. Even if it pains us all to take this decision, doctors advised us to take this step, so we want her to have the best care available. Preferably in Kerala.

"Needed career advice Hi all I needed some career advice from folks here

So I have done my MBA from a relatively newer IIM (17-19 Batch) with majors in finance and marketing I got placed in leading bank as a relationship manager which was the third company on campus.I always wanted either a marketing or consultant profile but our placement committee had informed us that not many good consulting or marketing firms would visit the campus and hence we should not miss out on any opportunity and hence i did not take any chance and got placed. However after i got placed several good companies both in marketing and consulting did visit our campus,but due to the one person one job policy of the college i could not sit in any of them. Now i am stuck with a sales profile which neither has good package or a great location.Its not that I hate sales but it's just that I don't want to be stuck in sales profile for life which I would be at my current job.So i am thinking of quitting the job and am actively applying for both consultant and marketing roles however it is difficult getting shortlisted as i am a fresher and on top of that most companies do not prefer some one who has left his job early to join them as i got to know in the interview( one of the few place where i got shortlisted) which i gave.I would be highly grateful if you folks here can provide some guidance for me.",Non-Political

"Need help about a land dispute. (Please spare some time to read) I have a very old house, that was built in the 1950s. The neighbours built theirs much later, and they did some trespassing in the name of expansion. As my mother lived there alone, she tried her best to fight, but they built the building while obstructing some of our land.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, we are building a new, bigger house on our land. We are using every inch of our land. This means the neighbours' windows would be rendered useless as they'll be completely covered. The same people now came to us and requested to leave some margin while we're building. We don't want to leave any of our land.

&amp;#x200B;

So the other party is resorting to verbal abuses &amp; threats. We think they're just trying to invoke a reaction from us, so that they can somehow delay our construction work. We have all the papers of our land and our house, so we are legally in the right. This means they'll not take a legal action and thus I guess they want us to make a mistake (e.g. a physical attack). We want to avoid a legal action as we have had a pathetic experience with the judiciary. But I am just worried they don't do something illegal.

"Anyone aware about the dynamics of worklife amd workplace politics, casteist politics of the under mentioned job(s)? So fundamentally, I am in my third year of engineering at the moment and I have decided( although not wholeheartedly) that I will go for the government exams primarily because I want 1. stability,  2. recognition 3. Work life balance and 4. so that I can work o my hobbies viz ekectric guitar, photography and travelling

The government exams which I think tick the boxes for me is IAS, solely ( Though I will sacrifice my hobbies for that obviously as the responsibility would be much greater in magnitude). The backups which I think would work well are

1. UPSC CSE( IRS , specifically because it is all in all a desk job in my estimation, also is a great backup if I attemp the CSE again the subsequent year)
2. UPSC IFoS, for obvious reasons
3. SSC CGL( I have heard ministry of external affairs department has a few desk jobs. Also, ASO)
4. RBI Grade B, I heard that bank exams are mostly riddled with casteist policies such as late promotions and the like

What do you suggest? I have an aptitude for the social science subjects in general and psychology, philosophy in particular. In addition to that, I like to think that I am fairly decent in analytical reasoning and the rest of aptitude reasoning tests and even if I wasnt I could well develop and sharpen them as I still have two more years",Photography
"To Redditors of Kolkata It's not the buildings, the roads, the bridges & other concrete that make a city what it is, but the people inhabiting it. Hence, my dearest peers, knowing this city to be their home, lend me your ears.

These are dark times that we're going through. Violence. Oppression. Racism. You name it and it's what we experience, ad nauseam. Change is needed. We need it — we demand it; and this being the season of ballot boxes & EVMs, we yearn to vote to that end. 'Tis here, I beg to differ and ask: is it really a considerable choice when we're given to choose our predators, between lions, tigers and wolves? Yes, one of them is way worse than the others & needs to be gone for everyone's good; but is empowering the other murderers any better?

For as long as I remember, our lives have been spent as slaves & serfs to these powers: the fools, bigots & goons, called politicians we elect into leaders, the banks, capitalists & industrialists we sell ourselves to and to each other, caught in their barbaric game of tag, in which we're all 'it' in the end. I want to change all of that; don't you?

They say, everything big, starts small. Hence, in a world of 7.6 billion, would it be too wrong to start with our city of 14 million, prided so much for its openness, liberalism & intellegentia? Kolkata is OUR CITY: OUR COMMONS, OUR HOME, enclosed by bigots & greedy gluttons to have created a graveyard for our dreams and for life, especially for the thousands who pour into it everyday, hoping to obtain the collectively acknowledged fictional oxygen, called money, required of us all to exist. This is no longer a city, but a corporate heath, bearing concrete in place of vegetation.

I yearn of you, hence, let's not set aside our differences on who we wish to elect, which fiction we wish to pray to and so on, but evolve our minds to move beyond such gibberish and actually work to make this city sustainable, homely, liveable, post partisanism, post market, post capitalist and really smart, not just a dumb city with proprietary wifi, that the oligarchs deem smart. Let us build, on this pyre of yesterdays' failures, a new city that truly would shower joy on all.

Considering today's problems, my wish is to take back the city into our collective hands, as our commons, manage it so, and make it thrive, not grow exponentially. Of course, when I say take back, I don't ask for a violent revolution of the ploretariat, but establishment of mutual-aid-networks & P2P Commoning practices, with each of our houses, condos, etc. being its reliable nodes. It is impossible to build such a space using current structures, such as the market (a network where people paywall goods & services to exploit each other & accumulate capital) or the state, with its systemic biases of race, religion, etc., the NGO circus standing on Corporate Social Responsibility Grants, acting as band-aids distributed by those that machine gun us, and other top-down, vertical (hierarchical) institutions. Therefore let's start here, as the Kolkata Commons Collective, a mutual-aid-network, where we organize ourselves horizontally, as equals, and work hard to produce, maintain and common the commons for us all to enjoy.

In case you think my beliefs to be Utopian and my ideas too lofty, the same was & still is thought of the knowledge commons: Wikipedia, the numerous thriving Wikis, Free & Open Source Software, especially Linux, which powers apart from the desktops of a few of us, the entire internet, all supercomputers, most phones (Android, Sailfish, Tizen), Open Source Hardware such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, RISC V, the Wikispeed car, FOSMC bike, 3D Printers, Open Designs, Creative Commons works, Theatre Commons grouups, Cities like Seoul, Barcelona, Brussels, etc., the hackerspaces & real makerspaces (anarchist, non-profit, commons oriented ones, unlike the corporate, for-profit open washes of science museums & technical schools) coming up around the world, etc., and many more. The big question is, whether we continue our banal, servile, practically cannibalistic ways, being skeptical of our capabilities, or pitch in to prove the market-worshiping, orthodox, skeptics wrong, to liberate ourselves and eveyone else?

[Here's a nice introduction to the Commons](https://youtu.be/nsRFdBBOyzU?t=155).

In case you wonder what are these commons I so talk about, feel free to check this [6-minutes' short](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_pRS9167vk) or [24-minutes' long](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cKrcQ30518) explanations.

After that of course, let us please network & work! Here are some of my proposals — a list to which you're more than welcome to add, via comments maybe.

Proposals:—

* Localizing our physical, economic circuits to reduce the ecological footprint & make the city resilient to calamities, both natural & artificial. The media may be glorifying Orissa on its disaster management, since Fani hit, but let's remember that huge sectors of the state are still dead, without electricity, water, etc. since being dependent on a centralized power grid system, they've no recourse but wait for the long electrical and other circuits to be connected again become functional again.
* So noting the above, creating, improving & sharing our own version of [Open Source Ecology](http://opensourceecology.org/)'s [Global Village Construction Set](https://www.opensourceecology.org/gvcs/gvcs-machine-index/), and establishing a network of [Hackerspaces](https://hackerspaces.org/) to start manufacturing [Glocally](http://commonstransition.org/what-is-p2p-an-introduction/) (doing the light things globally and the heavy things locally), to aid us.
* Running a web of [SOLEs (Self Organized Learning Environments)](https://www.theschoolinthecloud.org/) to aid our education.
* Creating a distributed internet based on meshnet technology, using the [ESP8266](http://esp8266.net/) and similar Open Source Wireless microchips, protocols like [LoRaWAN](https://lora-alliance.org/about-lorawan) like systems, etc., to free our dependence on centralized, paid, private connection providers  we use to access the WWW and communicate. So think distributed web with [IPFS](http://ipfs.io/) & [dat](https://datproject.org/) protocols, along with garlic routed, P2P VoIP, accessible & managed as a common, without any central authority or monetary barriers.
* Manufacturing & distribution of basic phones similar to the [WiPhone](http://a.wiphone.io/), to inhabitants who require it, and much, much later, a fully Open Source, [RISC V](https://riscv.org/) based smartphone running [Android ROM](https://source.android.com/)s or [GNU/Linux distros](https://itsfoss.com/open-source-alternatives-android/) with touch friendly UIs.
* Establishing a real, public transport system using car-sharing algorithms (Real Sharing and not Uber/Ola/Lyft/.../'s share washed micro-lending economy) to share the leftover seating & storage spaces on our existing Cars, converting our petrol & diesel drinkers to sustainable, local sources, such as electric, via renewables like solar, wind, hydro, etc., collecting, scavenging & hacking the abandonned vehicles, lying on randomly on roads, especially around Police Stations to aid these ventures, producing, distributing & evolving the [WikiSpeed](http://wikispeed.org/), [OSCAR](http://www.theoscarproject.org/), [OpenMotors](https://www.openmotors.co/)' [Tabby](https://www.openmotors.co/tabbyevo/), [FOSMC](https://www.fictiv.com/blog/fosmc), & other platforms, and connecting them as a Transport Commons for everyone to enjoy.
* Running networks of [submersiles](https://www.openrov.com/), [solar powered](https://solarimpulse.com/), [lightweight](http://ligeti-stratos.com/index.html) [aircraft](http://makerplane.org/) & [low altitude satellite systems](https://libre.space/), to physically reach greater distances without having to go through state regulations and corporate pay walling.
* Establishing distributed power-grids, using solar, wind and other available, sustainable technology, to escape our dependence on the Power Corps.
* Movement to Open Source platforms, as opposed to proprietary, private ones to remove our dependence on Corps. For instance, moving from MS Windows, Apple Mac OS X, etc. to GNU/Linux distros, FreeBSD forks, etc.
* Nurturing Open Source Communities, to voluntarily labour to help develop the global Open Source pool and other Commons
* Creating a [network](https://farm.bot/) of Vertical Farms, Aeroponic Gardens, Aquaponic Greenhouses, and so on to [produce](http://farmhack.org/tools) Food Commons for us all, networking into a post-market, moneyless ecosystem using the [Open Food Network](https://openfoodnetwork.org/).
* Creating a network of sustainable [water](http://www.freewat.eu/) cycles to provide potable, [fresh water commons](http://openwaterfoundation.org/).
* Providing universal healthcare as a commons, producing [Open Source medicines](http://www.opensourcepharma.net/) & [medical equipment](https://hackaday.com/2018/01/30/making-the-case-for-open-source-medical-devices/), in our mesh of [bio-hackerspaces](https://biohack.me/), [while also](http://openbci.com/) [extending our human bodies](https://openprosthetics.org/)' capabilities through transhumanist practices and sustaining a thriving grinding (biohacking) culture in the city.
* Hacking our prodigal buildings to make them [more comfortable, effective & efficient](https://www.openbuildinginstitute.org/), connecting everything with DiY Open Source IoT systems.
* Nurturing a thriving pro-science, DiY, hacker/maker culture in our city along with aiding education in STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts & Mathematics) and the humanities in their advanced forms ... the list goes on.
* And finally, scaling to the suburbs and villages of West Bengal, and even other cities in other states, connecting Kolkata to the global commons movement, and making ourselves visible on the global map, to help liberate the world.",Science/Technology

[AOC's 70% Marginal Tax Rate](https://nowthisnews.com/videos/politics/alexandria-ocasio-cortezs-70-marginal-tax-rate-isnt-that-radical)

When we were born as a republic and our Constitution was being drafted, one of the tallest leaders of the land could foresee the problem we ail with even today. BR Ambedkar warned us about a divide and that divide was not just of caste but of rich and poor. The recent Oxfam Report on Inequality in India is a testament to that. Somewhere along the line we have failed to bridge that divide.

We have progressed, indubitably but failed to progress collectively. Poverty and hunger still ails the weakest among us. I remember watching one video of Raghav Bahl where he mentioned how India, as a mixed economy have actually got the worst of both worlds. Ours is not a **capitalist economy** and even with Indira's 42nd amendment, it isn't a **socialist economy** either.

I am not a Rahul fanboy, I supported Modi and voted for BJP but I concur with Rahul's tweet when he announces MIG and says 'we cannot build a new India while millions of our brothers & sisters suffer the scourge of poverty.'

While all this is happening in India, in the west, USA, the Democrats are making a comeback, they have recently won back the House with their diverse bunch of Reps and are putting a leash on their meglomaniac President. The hotly debated topic and the eyesore for Fox News being? AOC's 70% Marginal Tax Rate on which she campaigned and won and will probably take it forward.

All these three events are happening at the same time and I do not see why we are not having this debate in India. Our divide is only growing and we cannot collectively grow until we take care of the poor and weakened ones. Here is an interesting statistic!

I do understand when you say that Ambani (or other ultra rich people) have notional wealth because it lies in stocks. This is a very capitalistic thought and factually correct but at the same time, incomplete. Ambani's wealth lies in RIL's stocks but, **STOCKS PAY DIVIDENDS**! Ambani, according to [this report](https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/mukesh-ambanis-dividend-income-from-reliance-industries-trumps-his-salary), **made Rs 14,553 crore in dividend through his stake in the company over the last 10 years** and  **Rs 1,804 crore in 2018 alone** and that with **a salary of Rs 15 crore annually**.

A rough calculation on Google's currency converter would tell you that **he can finance like two more $100 million weddings with the payout of 2018 ALONE**! So don't talk to me about the concept of notional wealth and how if he starts liquidate, RIL stocks would crash, a common and idiotic argument.

So yeah, we cannot build a new India while millions of our brothers and sisters suffer the scourge of poverty and MIG is sure as hell seems a nice idea (not talking about execution right now) and taxing the ultra rich like AOC says cannot be ruled out in India as well. This is India, we have a probe on Mars while we rank 103 of 119 countries in Global Hunger Index, the divide is real.

I am writing down all this because there **needs to be a debate** on this in India as well. The tax plan may just as well be a way to finance UBI or MIG in India but let's talk policy and make a buzz about this.

Lastly, here's a nice tweet from AOC on her idea of income inequality which I absolutely love. [Somewhere between “teachers shouldn’t have to sell their own blood to make rent” & “billionaires with helipads and full-time workers on food stamps shouldn’t exist in the same society”](https://twitter.com/aoc/status/1085293594603339776?lang=en)",Business/Finance

## Highlights

* **Background:** On June 28, 2019, the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) invited bids from reputed turnkey solution providers for the implementation of a centralised Automated Facial Recognition System (AFRS).
* **Need for established safeguards:** The proposal to introduce facial recognition into society currently comes with a variety of concerns that need to be addressed first. We write a legal notice to the NCRB  with also a covering letter and a copy of the notice to Home Minister, Shri. Amit Shah and Home Secretary, Shri. Rajiv Gauba, highlighting the features and scope of the AFRS and its unfathomable detriment it could bring about to Indians if implemented.

## Know your enemy

Its important to understand the characteristics the Request for Proposals requires the systems to possess, in order to understand how problematic it will be. Our legal notice highlights features which will be covered here in brief to provide basic context.

1. *Function:* The AFRS is intended to be a repository of all crime and criminal related facial data and should be able to identify or verify a person from a variety of inputs ranging from images to videos.
2. *Integration:* The system should be able to be integrated with various other databases such as ICJS, CCTNS, IVFRT, state police integration software in existence or any others. The integration does not stop there, it requires the system to be compatible with other biometric solutions such as Iris and AFIS but doesn't specify what these databases are. Might we have yet another Aadhaar worry to add to our frown lines?
3. *Identification:* As per requirements of the RFP, the system should not only be able to match images from a variety of databases, it should also be equipped to capture images from CCTV footage, public or private video feeds. As concerning as this sounds, there's more. It should also have the ability to tag images uploaded from newspapers, raids, sketches etc. with identifiers based on sex, age, scars, tattoos, consider landmarks, features and contours in identifying individuals and also accommodate for images with plastic surgery and make up for accuracy in identification.
4. *Technical requirements:* The aspects that stuck out in the RFP largely related to the need for the system to be compatible with bio-metric solutions such as Iris and Fingerprint identification systems. It also requires there that there be security in storage, user access and authentication
5. *Security requirements:* The bidder is largely responsible for additional measures in maintaining the integrity, confidentiality and availability of data that will be stored, apart from the established ISO standard prescribed in the RFP.

## Here's why we aren't quite ready for sci-fi

We take a closer look at these *not so frightening* features and identify concerns with the entire technology itself.

* *Absence of legality:* The requirement of facial recognition systems does not stem from a statutory basis nor is it a result of the executive power of the Government. Clearly it lacks any sort of legal backing. This is in addition to the violation of privacy it will so flagrantly undermine as it fails to fulfil any of the elements laid down by Puttaswamy v. Union of India (2017 (10) SCALE 1) in permitting a violation of privacy.
* *Manifest arbitrariness:* Beginning to picture the massive invasion of privacy the AFRS will potentially have? Especially with its all seeing eye looking at not only databases  and databases of images but also strategically located CCTV footage, images of newspaper clippings, raids, sketches etc., all most likely without your knowledge. This kind of en-masse surveillance is bound to bring about a high degree of damage. Studies by MIT and Georgetown and trials conducted the London Metropolitan Police acknowledge that pervasive biases that exist currently within our societies are likely to be mimicked by the algorithms within these systems. Mis-identification and discriminatory profiling is the result we're looking at if these systems are implements. Apparently, the already existing discriminatory practices perpetuated by human beings is no longer enough, we must look to AI to continue our dirty work.
* *Absence of safeguards and accountability:* In light of the above, there is currently no legal restrictions or limitations to this technology to ensure its proportional use or afford protection to those it interacts with. Add facial recognition to the on going debate on CCTVs and we have ourselves a full fledged mix of India and China no longer being restricted to the Indo-Chinese cuisine.

Considering the trajectory India appears to be on with mass surveillance and technological perpetuating of discrimination, a scarier version of the Orwellian dystopia seems to be right up our alley. We urge the NCRB to take a step back and recall the bidding process for the Automated Facial Recognition System until adequate safeguards that address these various concerns are put into place. This request is also with a disclaimer that failure to do so may cause us to seek remedy in accordance with the law.

Looking for places to make a trip during independence day week in North India So I am meeting some of my cousins after a long time this indepence day week and I'm planning on going on a trip with them. But the thing is they're a little bit choosy about places. They want to visit some place in North India. And they have already been to kashmir and sikkim. They also don't want metro city areas like Delhi or nearby places like Agra since we want the trip to last for at least 4 days with some scenic beauty. Is there any place like that in North India to visit during independence day week? What are the chances of those places getting rainfall around that time? A senior member of family is also going to accompany us so I don't want to do hiking.,AskIndia

"Reddit India Recap of 2018 Welcome to the first ever installment of a year in review of this subreddit where we look at some of the best and most influential events and posts of this year. 

2018 has been quite a rollercoaster of a year for this subreddit as well as the country! With one of the highest growth rates ever of this subreddit. We grew from just above 100K subscribers to now more than the 1.6L magic number of subscribers. 

The year saw landmarks Supreme Court judgements in India, most importantly the striking of Section 377 of the IPC criminalizing gay sex. We have had many amazing posts this year which go from the entire subreddit grouping together to help people in Kerala with the largest donation drive ever on this subreddit with verified donations over ₹7,00,000 to paying college fees of a user who couldn't afford to. 

Here are some highlights in **no particular order** which made up this year of r/india:

"Suddenly, ‘one nation, one policy’ sentiment is overtaking other models -Interview with YV Reddy, IAS, former RBI Governor and 14th Finance Commission Chairman You have said in your book that there is a feeling in some quarters that cooperative federalism is being replaced with coercive federalism. What is the basis for this comment?

>Some developments have taken place after the 14th Finance Commission’s (FC) recommendations. Cesses and surcharge have increased significantly, even after GST. The States felt that they were being short-changed by the way the Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) were restructured, increasing the share that the State government has to put in and then the way the GST is being administered. The general debate earlier was about the Bihar model competing with the Gujarat model and different States’ models of development competing with each other.

>Now, suddenly the “one nation, one policy” sentiment is overtaking the other models. And the Planning Commission, which was a forum for States, is also not there now.

>Due to this institutional vacuum, Ministries are directly dealing with CSS. So, the spirit of discussion and dialogue is being replaced by diktats by various Ministries. Some say that there is no dialogue, which is untypical of cooperative federalism.

You’ve said that States are now forced to share more from their own resources in CSS. After your own 14th FC recommendations, the impression was that the Centre was devolving more to the States as it went up from 32% to 42%.

>As my co-author G.R. Reddy will explain, the comparison is not between 32% and 42%; what was 39% became 42%, because of the way the computations differed. This increase was more than offset by the other actions on cesses and surcharges and CSS. So there has been virtually no advantage for the States

>G.R. Reddy: The 14th FC considered the entire revenue account. Unlike the previous FCs, it considered even the Plan revenue account. As a result, some of the Plan transfers were subsumed under tax devolution.

>The difference between 14th FC and others is that the former did away with sector specific grants that amount to 4-5% of the total devolution. If you take these two together, the actual devolution would have been 39% earlier and that became 42%. Even this 3% increase is not very visible because it has been more than neutralised by the Centre. The reality is that it has increased the matching contribution of the States in CSS and done away with 6000 model schools started in 2011; half way through, in 2015-16, it took a decision to terminate the entire scheme of model schools.

>The entire burden of running schools and meeting expenditure – both capital and operational expenditure, has now fallen on the States.

>They then restructured 66 CSS into 22 umbrella schemes. So there is no change in the number of CSS schemes. All components have remained the same.

Why didn’t States raise the issue?

>We have done so before the 15Th FC… and communicated to the Centre that what they had done was not correct.

>Immediately after the 14th FC recommendations were accepted, the Hon Prime Minister wrote to us saying ‘now that the States are flush with funds…’, We wrote back saying there is absolutely no increase in the flow of funds to the States, but only a change in the composition of transfers in favour of untied transfers. Now what has happened is there has been a qualitative change in the transfers to States – we are getting more money through untied transfers.

>The total transfers as a percentage of gross revenues to the States from the Centre has remained at the same level – 49%.

Aren’t untied transfers desirable? It frees States to use funds for whatever purpose they deem fit…

>Whatever additional money to have come through untied transfers is now tied up towards meeting the additional commitment.

>In the revised pattern of CSS, you have to put in more money.

>You have made a commitment, you can’t ‘uncommit’. But they have changed the pattern. Whatever untied funds you have got, you put in those schemes.

>For example, in 2014, Telangana’s contribution to the CSS was around ₹2,000 crore. In 2015-16, because of the change in funding patterns, it has gone up to ₹3,500 crore. So there is additional commitment on the part of the States.

>There is further commitment for States, because of termination of some CSS – the model schools scheme is an example. Another is BRGF – backward regions grant fund - for Telangana State, 9 of the then 10 districts were under the BRGF. They substantially reduced allocations under women and child welfare also.

>There is a view that there are just too many CSS – money is not efficiently used

>The other concern with CSS is that the money is too thinly spread across schemes. For example, if you take education or health, States are spending close to 80%. The Centre is supplementing the States up to only 20%, which does not make much difference. That too comes with conditionalities, submission of uses, visits of Central teams, delays in release of funds. As a result of these procedures, we are unable to fully utilise the Centre’s allocations. I don’t think any State has used the funds from Centre entirely.

So the solution is to offer funds and allow States a free hand?

>The Commission under Dr. Reddy recommended the same – that the number of CSS should be restricted to some nationally identified priorities.

>Dr. Y.V. Reddy: Basic issue is that Finance Commission is one mechanism which essentially is meant for sharing of taxes and that is based on a formula. 80-90% of transfers to States has always been on tax devolution. In tax devolution, there are no conditions, how much weight you give for population, which census’ population and other consideration namely as fiscal capacity. The only question there is what weight you give. If you give weight equally for efficiency and equity, they cancel out, in some sense.

You mentioned institutional vacuum. Do you think NITI Aayog has not been able to step up to the plate?

>There were some deficiencies in the way the Planning Commission functioned. There was an impression given to the States that they had to go to the Commission as a supplicant but not for discussion. That was its weakness which had to be corrected. In the correction process, that bad habit was got rid of but there was no new system. There is no forum now. Each Ministry has become an authority unto itself and is able to dictate terms to the States.

Is it deliberate that the Aayog does not have power or did it evolve thus?

>That is a question mark. Whether it was by design or by default, the result is that the individual Ministries are indicating to the States, which means there is no coherent and comprehensive view of the States in the process.

There is a view that some of the terms of reference of the 15th FC may not stand the test of constitutional validity. What’s your view?

>There are 3-4 issues. It is true that it generated unprecedented reaction. Never before for an FC have a number of CMs got together and protested. Also, some scholars questioned the constitutional validity of some Terms of Reference – for example, whether there is need for revenue deficit.

>The constitution provides for it and each FC needs to decide on this. Third, the 15th FC has been asked to review the 14th FC. It is a continuing process. Above all, the Commission has been asked to make recommendations keeping in view some performance indicators and that States should conform to certain policy parameters, which reflected the existing policy of the Centre.

>The way the FC is structured, it is not supposed to be an instrument of the central government’s priorities of the day. So it has been questioned on several grounds.

>Most of the considerations mentioned in the ToR are not necessarily binding on the FC. The Commission can choose to or choose not to take these into account. But it needs courage and vision for the Commission to do so – we are hoping that will be there.

What’s your view on the controversy over the base date of population census in the 15th FC?

>The whole question is whether it is a correct thing or not. It is difficult to defend outdated population as the basis. Because the FC is supposed to take into account the needs of the State for the period. How can 1971 population determine the needs of the State in 2021? It was undertaken on the grounds that States should not be penalised. But what about States that have taken action on family planning after 1971? They don’t get anything. It should be a continuing incentive, right?

>This time, they prescribed 2011 population. That is also not valid. The FC recommendations are from 2020. So you should have estimated population of the States for the period 2020-2025. Ideally, there should be no stipulation of a date for population and should be left to the FC but if at all, one should have the population relevant for the period.

Isn’t GST a good example of cooperative fiscal federalism?

>It is an extraordinary institution and is commendable. It did not come into existence overnight. It started as an informal committee in the Finance Ministry and has evolved. In the implementation, there has been dissatisfaction expressed. The fact that the Centre has a veto increases its influence. But that is part of the game. Concerns may be there in the way it is working. But as an institutional set up, it is extraordinarily good. It is a good example of collaboration and cooperation in an institution between the Union and the States.

Can this be replicated in other areas?

>Exactly. This is on the revenue side. On the expenditure side, fiscal transfers outside the FC, it can be brought under some inter-State council. That was the recommendation of the 14th FC.

>The GST Council may not be replicated but is a good approach to build on. On the expenditure side, it is a different type of collaboration, compared to the revenue side.

Is that a recommendation that the 15th FC can give?

>Yes. The transfers to the States from the Centre can take FC and non-FC routes. The 14th FC gave recommendations on how to structure the non-FC transfers. It’s only in the ambit of advice.

>There are three approaches: virtually abolish the Commission by making a constitutional amendment and say this will be the percentage; the second is to have a continuous FC, a GST Council type of mechanism but the FC gets subsumed in this; the third is to have the FC and a design of new institutional arrangements which will be more technical, more political and more consensus-based, as recommended by the 14th FC.

>All this is provoked partly because of the GST Council which has been positive and partly because of the institutional vacuum — both these are pushing us to find new institutional mechanisms.

Pleasantly surprised at the functioning of the GST Council. It comprises people with varying vote bank compulsions.

>The consensus has been the result of number of years of effort. Consultative process has been going on for the last 10-15 years. States also are convinced that it is a win-win situation, for the sake of tax harmonisation across the country, they felt it was better. And there was also the feeling that GST is a better form of tax, leading to better compliance. It builds up a value chain. Initially, there was some apprehension on part of manufacturing States that they may lose out this being a destination tax. So we have put in place a 2 year statutory mechanism that they will be compensated for a period of 5 years. The states have yielded lot more space than the Centre. For States, VAT constituted about 60% of their old tax revenue. They have conceded 50% of their fiscal space to the Centre, whereas the space conceded by the Centre is only 30%. They still get customs duty, income tax etc. In the working, there is still a trust deficit because the voting pattern is fully loaded in favour of the Centre, which has almost a veto power.

>Then, the way the GST is administered is also raising apprehensions in the minds of the people that they are not being treated fairly by the Centre. Like delays in apportionment of IGST, delays in payment of compensation cess, collecting more compensation cess than required. Best thing to do is to reduce compensation cess correspondingly that they are not doing. So there is surplus compensation cess lying with the Centre to be distributed after 5 years. It is for the Centre to set the record straight and remove this trust deficit.

On the special category status for Andhra Pradesh, what was the stand that you took in the 14th FC?

>Special category status is not under the jurisdiction of any FC. In my book, I have explained the Centre’s version of the relationship between 14th FC recommendation and the special category.

>If you want the simple truth, 14th FC did not make any recommendation on inclusion or exclusion of special category. The issue of according special category status and assurance by the PM was given months before the 14th FC could give recommendations.

>But the government has its own explanation as to why it interprets the recommendations of 14th FC with regard to special category status. I have given that in the book. It is for the reader to decide why and how these are related.

Cess is becoming a monster in the administrative system. With GST we assumed that cess won’t any longer be a part of the system. But with Kerala, we have a disaster cess. Isn’t the purpose of a reform lost with such acts?

>There is a calamity fund and the Centre is expected to come to the assistance of states when such things happen and there is always a burden sharing, you can’t anticipate this. Now the recourse to cess for such things is unusual.

Isnt this a step away from cooperative fiscal federalism? The Council is telling one state that funds needed for rebuilding after a disaster are to be generated from within that State...

>That is why some of them are dissenting calling it coercive federalism. These are ‘innovations’ that some States are uncomfortable with.

You have Kerala at the upper end of the social development scale and Uttarakhand at the lower end; T.N., Gujarat and Maharashtra at the higher end of the economic development index with Odisha and Bihar at the other. How is it possible for any central body, including the FC to reconcile these differences?

>That is exactly the issue with regard to any federation. In any federation there are competing considerations. You have to build trust amongst yourselves so therefore there is no fixed formula. That’s how you operate the system.

>What is needed is for the Centre to be able to bring together the States and treat these inequalities or calamities as a national problem in which both Union and States participate. Problem now is that whenever a State opposes the Centre it is accused of being anti-national. Being anti-union is not anti-national.

>There are 3 levels of debate – State interest, Union interest, national interest. To build a national consensus, the Union and States must be together. If the States get the feeling that the Union has abrogated to itself the sole authority of national interest, the States resent it. That is the essence of the matter.

How much is this because of a strong leader at the top?

>You should go back to Constituent Assembly debates. Dr Ambedkar when introducing the draft constitution, discusses the merits and demerits of parliamentary and presidential form of government and says why parliamentary system is important for India. He says that India is essentially undemocratic and therefore emphasises on continuous accountability. He says continuous accountability is more important than stability. That was the deliberate choice on this type of issue.

In 14th FC, you recommended forest cover as a determinant. In the five years that have lapsed, have you studied how that recommendation has helped India’s environment cause?

>No. But it’s an interesting area where we have to see the impact of the recommendation. But the logic is simple – forest cover. The state govt is contributing to environment at a cost to itself. It cannot use the resource but has to maintain it. So you have to provide for it. The basic principle is externalities. The state is contributing at its own cost – it does not gain anything. It incurs cost to maintain the forest.

"[AskIndia] Why do we have so much distrust of Businesses and Markets? Was listening to a talk from Kunal Shah (founder of Freecharge and Cred) and found quite a few insights about the attitude of Indians towards generating wealth through businesses.

A few things really stood out. For example -

1. India has a unique MRP system for products found nowhere else in the world. It gives us the illusion that we are charged fairly for our goods but it works very counter-intuitively against the poor.
Because the rich pay almost the same price as the poor. A richer neighbourhood should have richer prices than in a poorer neighbourhood.
The manufacturer has to price the MRP at a rate higher than he would in a competitive market because he needs to make sure he covers his cost or overruns due to dead or destroyed stock.

2. How we, as Indians, value money over time. We would not pay for quality which saves us time but we will gladly buy sub-quality goods if it saves us money.

3. We question and probe profit percentages of each private company but have no clue about the efficiency of government spending and yet we keep clamouring for more taxes.

4. Pre-1991, we were poor and ridden with Socialist policies which championed the poor and the farmers and we went bankrupt. But after 1991, when we allowed foreign money to come in, we saw a substantial rise in the standard of living and goods.
Yet, we are still calling restrictions on foreign capital in e-commerce and retail which is just perplexing.

5. We think the private companies are out to loot the people of India and we think Adani and Ambani are rich because of Modi but it is, in fact, the lack of competition and implementation of endless rules and licenses that allow Adani and Reliance to operate in any field with almost no competition.


I don't get it. Is this an education thing? Have we been taught capitalism incorrectly? The numbers are so clear yet we are still stuck in denial about having government involvement in the economy. So many people flock to capitalist economies from India yet why do we trust the government so much?

And before anyone says, yes I do think Healthcare, defense, law and order should be under government along with economic incentives for education and research but beyond that, you don't really need government.",AskIndia

"Communicating when internet is turned off There have been various reports that mobile networks are being turned off at sites of protest. It is important to stay connected and quickly share ideas and information during protests. Here are some off the grid apps that can be used when your provider turns off the internet.

"For those who still insist that CAA, NPR have no effect on Indians & those who are here legally So the premise that the CAA, NRC and such ways to profile the population of the country (under the pretext of checking illegal immigration) is fundamentally flawed. 

It is just a ruse. Slowly and gradually - the segregation , the discrimination will spread. Till it becomes all consuming 

A few days ago, this happened:

https://www.news18.com/news/india/hundreds-of-huts-of-illegal-bangladeshi-immigrants-razed-in-bengaluru-turns-out-all-are-indians-2465113.html

Based on a vague complaint by an MLA. But an action which resulted in the actual demolition of housing (admittedly, slums - but housing nevertheless)

So the problem wasn't slums (which would've been a noble cause) - but slums occupied by perceived ""foreigners"" 

As of today, another politician has raised suspicion that a bunch of construction workers were foreigners - because he saw them eating ""poha"":

https://www.news18.com/news/buzz/bjp-leader-who-thinks-eating-poha-makes-one-bangladeshi-has-united-all-foodies-against-him-2471355.html

Poha. Please understand.... ""P.O.H.A"".....

So - clearly - there is no actual basis for these actions & statements. But houses *have been* damaged and lives have been disrupted.

Now - a lot of the affected folks *did* have proof in the form of Aadhar cards, PAN Cards. 

So imagine the state of the folks - who don't have the (right\any at all) paperwork. Those folks shall be thrown into detention centres:

https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/assam-detention-centre-inside-indias-1st-detention-centre-for-illegal-immigrants-after-nrc-school-ho-2099626

But in a turn of events that not many are surprised by - the PM is straight up denying the very existence of such a detention centre:

https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/pm-modi-on-citizens-list-nrc-rumor-of-detention-center-raised-by-congress-and-urban-naxals-is-a-lie-2152700

The idea is - if such blatant lies & borderline fascism isn't stopped right away - it will keep growing and expanding and directly affecting more and more sections of the population.

One religious minority today, another tomorrow, backwards castes and tribes, sexual minorities and more.

Mind you - the ruling party threatened an entire state with blocked ration concessions - because Kerala objected to the implementation of NPR.

https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/bjp-leader-claims-kerala-won-t-get-ration-after-stopping-npr-yechury-says-we-ll-see-114872


For all the love & online appreciation we shower on those who have served in our armed forces, the same isn't extended to them in real life. Here is the case one such decorated Army veteran:

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-48523963

In what is quite possibly ***one of the highest profile situations*** to have arisen out of this entire fiasco, relatives of our former President have been excluded from the list of ""citizens"" in Assam - where the NRC was first implemented to near disastrous results:

https://www.news18.com/news/india/nrc-list-2019-former-president-fakhruddin-ali-ahmeds-family-among-2-million-in-assam-staring-at-uncertain-future-2291967.html


Now - either you are somehow still completely unaware of such events - or know about it but choose to turn a blind eye, willingly.

If it's the former - i hope my response ( and proof) makes you realize the events & brutalities that exist outside our admittedly privileged lives.

If it's the latter - well, i can't do much.

Edit: Thank you for gilding me, kind stranger.

I would like for all to bring up the cost of implementing NRC across the country - when discussing the same with folks who insist that the exercise has no religious or communal angle - and strictly a logistical viewpoint:

"Do people get socially / personally alienated because they're not interested / scared of pets? Over the past few months (and over the course of the last couple of years) I have noticed that an not having an overwhelming affection for dogs, cats and all assorted pets is a rather significant factor in maintaining relations with friends and family, dealbreakers when it comes to dating and possibly relations too. 

[ *""i'm a mother / father of 2 doggos""* ; *""if there's a doggo in your pic i'm dating you and stealing that good boi""* ; **the evergreen classic** *""doggos over humans any day...""* ; *""if my cat likes you, only then you have my approval...""* ; the deluge of appreciation tweets & posts on Instagram / Facebook; now the rise in posts in this very sub over the past week and many, many more...]

Dating apps have women and men displaying overwhelming affection for their pets. I've personally been unmatched and (digitally) broken contact with on a couple of occasions because I straight up admitted that i'm not too keen about pets (specifically dogs). 

[that i'm kinda scared of dogs in general due to a childhood mishap with a pet dog is a whole other issue altogether - growing up I've managed to control my fear/worry and while I don't exactly start screaming when in close proximity to a dog, I do look visibly panicked]

i'm not exaggerating when I say a potential marriage alliance was completely nipped in the bud because of the fact that she had a tattoo of her pet dog and I clearly admitted that i'm not a fan of having a pet / pets in the future. My entire existence as a human being and all my joys and sorrows, education, academics, work experience, sporting and personal achievements were instantly invalidated in a flash - because of this viewpoint.

while I clearly and obviously do not have an issue with folks having pets at their homes and the visible rise of pet friendly public spaces. cafes & restaurants - any attempts at trying to meet at non pet presence(d??) places is met with a lot of derision and straight up hostility. 

I understand that folks with pets treat them as nothing short of family members - but their decision to stay away from actual human beings; avoid and have a low opinion of those who are averse to pets - is rather confusing and if I may admit to it - a bit hurtful as well. I've missed out on a couple of social & personal relations because of this and I really do think it rankles.

**Childhood in my Hood, Spider-Man and INS DEGA**

As you can see, I am from Vizag. I was brought up and still live in the middle of an Industrial-Estate. My entire childhood revolved around [all sort of machines]( https://imgur.com/a/EdN3Xvj), machinery and welding sparks coming from the never ending fabrication works that went on in the hood. This sort of environment made me a naturally curious kid thanks to my dad and Uncle who both hold a Diploma in Mechanical Engineer for choosing the right neighbourhood. All my questions regarding these machines were nicely answered by my father and that in turn made me more interested in how things worked. This got a boost when I first met [*Spider-Man* and his amazing friends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0FJNBRP8P0). This show and other Sider-Man shows had a huge impact on me, so much so that I used to play with common house spiders in hopes that its bite would turn me into a Spider-Man. Thanks to Universe, venomous spiders are not that common in a typical Urban Indian household I guess, I’m still alive and well. Besides that stupidity, Spider-Man being a student of science and using science to solve problems or for fighting villains made me interested in sciences and I started to pay attention in classes and made me question and think about things in universe and nature. This helped me have good foundation in Maths and General Sciences. 

On the other hand, our neighbourhood is in the close vicinity of a Naval Airport, INS DEGA. This helped me develop a love for things that fly. Our Neighbourhood used to be perfectly aligned with the runway path of the airport, this gave me really up close view of the planes touching down and taking off of the airport. Being a Defense airport there were special aircrafts in addition to the commercial ones. Navy Week was and still is the best season for some flight watching. At the age of 11, this interest in flying things pushed me to apply the science I learnt in school to make an object that fly with the help of DC motors it failed, of course. But that failure has set the path which I would follow in my higher studies. My father introduced me to A.P.J. Abdul Kalam who has been a huge inspiration. I may not know the name of the degree but I decided to study the science of flight and how to build things that fly. That was the idea of a child. 

**Finding an admission for Undergrad, IITM- Shaastra 07 & 08, Job Hunt & Masters in UK**

I was good theoretically but competitive exams are not my thing. I knew, I wouldn’t succeed neither in JEE nor AIEEE so any dreams of doing Aerospace/Aeronautical Engineering were smashed, my parents are kind enough to not force me into that machinery and left me to my choice for EAMCET. I just have to get a Mechanical Engineering seat in Andhra University or GITAM. That’s good enough for me because, Mechanical engineering also covers the science of flight and these two are the best engineering schools of my city and I don’t have to leave town if got an admit. 

So I found myself in GITAM, it has been a fun ride there. I always loved hands on jobs since I am a kid. I love to build something or do something with my hands. In second year of undergrad I attended Shaastra’ 07 at IIT MADRAS and it changed my outlook on engineering as a whole. I was awed by the students who built and gave a demo of the [VTOL flight built by them, Team YU-FLY?]( https://imgur.com/a/jj7DiUk) It was the coolest thing I saw. It was when I started taking an interest in research and technological developments in my field and in general. Target was set to Shaastra 08, me and my childhood friends made a contraption built by our own hands using a lot of Jugaad and tools found from the hood. Have a look here [GIF 1]( https://gfycat.com/KnobbyCompetentBear), [GIF 2]( https://gfycat.com/ImperturbableDefenselessIberianmidwifetoad). That was the demo video we sent in with the abstract. We are the Mighty mavericks but we got of Lots of weak links in the plan and it worked only partially. This set the stage for my participation in a series of technical events that I would attend over the last two years of my Undergrad. 

My communication skills were really bad by the end of Undergrad and this meant I wasn’t doing good in the Campus Interviews. I only wanted to join a core company and I couldn’t find any. I did the 5 day assessment for technical engineer post in IAF but didn’t make that list too. Couldn’t get a good rank in GATE. But found myself an admission at a really good Mechanical Engineering School in UK. Education Loan was the only way I could afford this and my parents had to put our house on the line to get a loan. EDWISE has given me immigration support free of cost as I secured my own admission. Went to UK and finished my degree, visited London twice and returned home. That’s it. I did not make much contact with the life in UK, its land and its culture. I was limited by time and money. But with the help of High-speed internet, I did learn a lot about world, science and technology, history and was introduced to reddit, student guilds, game of thrones and a whole lot of popular culture through university life. This helped with my English and subsequently my communication skills.

**Shock after returning home**

After finishing the degree, I returned home only to find that the degree I just received is not valid in India. Even a private engineering college didn’t want to hire me as a lecturer because my degree is not considered a Master’s Degree. That was a huge blow to me. I had to look for opportunities abroad again. Thanks to my thesis supervisor in UK, a well-known name in his field, gave me a good recommendation letter which helped me secure a full scholarship to do doctoral research in Australia. I was so happy and my parents were really proud of me.

**My way Down Under and How life changed there: RA Job, Research and Cooking**

I never thought I’d end up in Australia of all places. I went there with no expectations and the first few months have been the most difficult months. Then I made friends at student housing, who pushed me to apply for RA position and that changed a lot of things. I got the position and during my term I would be promoted to a senior RA and would organize the best parties and events over the next couple of years. This gave me a huge exposure to Aussie, International students and cultures from around the world. I had to be outgoing for the job so I became an outgoing person. [My love for cooking, adventure, camping and off road driving]( https://imgur.com/a/w6k2kIk) helped me go to some of the remote parts of Australia and make some amazing friends along the way. People around me at uni and housing were mostly younger than me, were not judgemental at all and I could do what I want without fear of judgement. I was earning good money while having the best time of my life and cleared my education loan in no time. [Perfect song to describe my time down under](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpjvJdomfM) 

My research on the other hand was not going as expected. I am a hands-on person and I always enjoyed experimental work rather than simulations or numerical work. My research problem has been changed by supervisor from being heavily based on experiments to one that was half cooked right from the beginning which consisted mostly of Numerical work and only some namesake validation by experimental work. On top of that one of supervisor who is supposed to help me with Numerical work has moved to another university in another country all together and I was left with a supervisor who is Experimental guy guiding me on numerical work. From there it was a downward spiral and I ended up losing interest in the research I was doing. I produced two papers which in my opinion are not really great. 

On a parallel, I was doing really well as a RA, was cooking and trying some amazing recipes to whole lot of people from around the world and at one point [I cooked Indian food entirely made from scratch for the entire student village of 300 students](https://imgur.com/a/NqswIa9). Since I was a kid, I loved cooking and it was a life-long dream to own a restaurant someday and this idea was there in the back of my head all the time. And when it came to point where I can no longer continue my research work due to various reasons and I had to make a decision to change my line of work. It wasn’t easy, I had to consider so many things into account and had to find the confidence that I can cook commercially. 

**First Job in a Commercial Kitchen and How I found myself in a Road trip**

So I went searching for a job in a commercial Kitchen. After a lot of failed attempts, I went door to door along a popular coffee strip giving out [my new culinary resume](https://imgur.com/a/xVMIt9s) which I had to make up using the things I did so far. I got a call back from a Chef who loved my resume, my passion for the craft of cooking and gave me a job in his kitchen. Being the only computer literate among the staff I got to know the ropes of making stock lists, recipe cards, the numbers behind making a menu and running a commercial kitchen basically /r/kitchenconfidential. This gave me the confidence I needed. 

I rented a big motorcycle above 700CC which I always wanted to drive and just left for a drive. I covered 1400 KM in next two days along the southwest corner of Australia. This journey gave me the opportunity be with myself, think about myself and helped me come to a decision on so many things I wanted to do in life. The trip was really dangerous, I was driving 130-120 KMPH because I only rented the bike for two days and wanted to make the most out of it, I cannot lose sight of the road ahead because if I hit a kangaroo or things crossing the roads I’d crash at high speed and before I know it I’d be dead as Australia being so huge it would take hours for someone to notice me or get me to help. This fear for life made me so vigilant, self-aware and made me concentrate on the road like I never did before and that too hours on end. I was a different person at the end of this trip. I am not even exaggerating on this one. I felt like I conquered all my fears in life.

It was clear to me; I just had to do what makes me happy. I quit my research, quit the job in the kitchen and was finally on my way back home with the most daunting task ahead,  telling my parents about it, convincing them to help me start a Food Truck and to believe in my dream. After all is said and done, they still don’t get why I am doing this but decided to support my cause. 

**My Friend**

I could not do this alone; I needed a partner to do this with. The first person I got in mind was my lifelong friend. We went to same school since kindergarten and grew up together in the same neighbourhood and in a way we see thing uniquely in our own ways. He was not a brilliant student in class but he was the best when it comes to real world, he is creative, he can see things which no one else can in places nobody else even looks. He is brave and always helped me with my phobia for dogs; he has been a huge support in my life. I spoke to him regarding this and he immediately wanted to join me. He quit his job in Mumbai and came back to our city. He has his share of troubles at home, more than me and for that I really admire him for believing in my dream and to make this decision to join me on this journey.  

**Straight Outta Vizag**
	
I named our little venture Straight Outta Vizag because I truly believe this city has shaped my life so much, in a way it defines me and for that I love my city like how Peter Parker loves his city, New York. Although we are not the webbed vigilante we too try to do some good in our city. For our first socio-event, thanks to my sister and Good Universe, a NGO, [we organised an awareness campaign on women’s health in our neighbourhood](https://imgur.com/a/uKaRy2d) and it was a grand success. 

We started operations with this [Menu](https://imgur.com/a/WIlbGXU) and was getting a  good response. Then, Kerala floods happened so we decided to donate our earnings during this run towards the Kerala flood relief activities as you can see from our post history.

**Cold hands of the City governing bodies**

No matter how good our intentions are, we are not welcomed in the city. Before going on road, we went to various government offices like, Food safety and standards, Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation- GVMC and its Public Health wing, City Police and Fire Department to get permission according to this [Notification by Hyderabad City Police](http://www.ctp.gov.in/PressNote/NotificationFoodCourtVehiclePermission.pdf), I found online. It appears so that, none of the people I met have no idea if such a regulation existed in my City, Vizag. No one official has given us direction with this regard. No one has responded to us properly, most of the people claim that no one has come to them like us, asking permission to put up a food truck and that they won’t allow it, mostly because they haven’t done that before. But there are lot of food trucks running in the city. 

[I submitted a letter to the Commissioner, GVMC]( https://imgur.com/a/F0jGspG) in May but got no response even after all these months so we started operations with only a FSSAI license in hand. Where ever we go Police or the GVMC personnel has asked us to remove the truck. Why are other trucks allowed then? Later I learned that other food truck people formed into Unions area-wise and are running things according to their made up rules within the area like a “dhandha”. Why do I have to join a union of a particular place or all the places if I intend to set-up my truck?

**More Social Activism**

During the month of August 2018, we had rains for a couple of days and our street got flooded due to improper storm drains. We have had this issue for ages and our colony people have approached the municipality but nothing was done. In lieu of this, we brought it to the notice of [GVMC commissioner through an open letter](https://imgur.com/a/F0jGspG) on our facebook and twitter profiles, which talks not just about our problems in the hood but also other problems that I have seen in my city. This time we got a response but I did not mention my problems with the permits because it didn’t seem right to plug the same with problems in the hood and my city. 

GVMC responded promptly and started the restoration of storm drain works in September and finished the work during the second week of November. Due to these works happening we had to put a comma to our operations and resumed our work during third week of November. 

**What happened after we are back on road…**

This time we wanted to try a healthy breakfast menu and we set up shop on the way between VUDA Park and YSR statue Roundabout on the beach road. We were asked to vacate the place by an Assistant City Planning officer from GVMC Zone II. The next day we moved to parking in front of YMCA on beach road and two days later, this time, a sanitation inspector warns us not to put up the truck and it will be seized if we do so again. So we removed the truck and went to meet the GVMC Zone-II commissioner, Mr. Palli Nallanayya. Here’s how our interaction went by: 

Me n My friend walk into commissioner’s room who appeared to be in a staff meeting. 

Me – ‘trying to hand him the letter we already submitted to GVMC’-- utters the words: “Sir, memu food truck okati start chesam mee...” “Sir, we are starting a food truck…”
He cut me off there and with a growing frown on his face he just utters the word “ivvamu”... “Alantivi ivvamu ma zone Lo” “Stop it there, we will not give you a permit. We don’t do this sort of thing in our Zone.”

Looking at his body language and the way he didn’t even bother to hear what we have to say made me sick and we left the room. 

Because of these obstacles we are now without a proper location for our truck. Many have suggested me ways to get a contact in GVMC who knows “how to get things done” But I do not want to go that route because it is not the right way to do it and as stupid as I am I will fight for what is right and we are planning to meet the commissioner regarding this and File a RTI with GVMC and City Police regarding what they know about already existing food trucks. Meanwhile, we found some gigs with adventure agencies and started arranging food for trekking and camping events in our beautiful and untapped eastern ghats.  We also cater to small parties, family gatherings, speciality events, college get-togethers and many more. We met some amazing people along the way, particularly youngsters who seem to respect and admire what we are trying to do which in turn gave us energy to continue on our journey. We intend to bring cooking and the joy of making food closer to our patrons and give them a well-rounded dining experience wherever they choose to eat.  

Our city has so much to offer in terms of tourism. Our tourism potential is not fully tapped into and we want to promote our city tourism which will help create jobs in the local communities. I cordially invite any and all off you folks that love a good beach or a view from a hill, come visit our city, Vizag. If you choose to hire us we can take you around and accompany you with good food and present you with some amazing views that are unique to our city and it’s geography. As the songs goes... [Say hey, good lookin' - what ya got cookin'? How's about cookin' somethin' up with me?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjCoKslQOEs)


I’m sharing this with the reddit community because it is a unique platform compared to other social networking sites and the people, stories from reddit have inspired me a lot and helped me develop as person. And by sharing this I would like inform the community about us and hope that our story may inspire someone else in realizing their own dreams. Also, to reach out to a lot of people who barely know about our City in terms of a travel destination and to reach out artists, content creators, travel bloggers and to collaborate with anyone who is interested in enjoying good food and nature. Do have a look at us, know about us and if possible inform your friends about us. See you on the road. Meanwhile here’s [some pics of our truck, menus we did and of places you can visit in and around Vizag.](https://imgur.com/a/lAHV5Xj)

"RESTAURANT UPDATE-HOW TO SURVIVE & WIN AFTER LOCK-DOWN ENDS?  

As per the article in [Businesstoday.in](https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/coronavirus-impact-50-restaurants-to-shutdown-if-lockdown-extends-till-may/story/399903.html) which is regarding the restaurant survival during the lock-down period in India it is said that:

**50% restaurants to shut if lockdown extends; Zomato, Swiggy business down 10% :** Only 5-6 restaurant chains have enough cash reserves to sustain more than a month, the sector will need government's help if there's no improvement after May.

Well, their is always a brighter side of the story! and this lockdown period can well utilized for all the research and development for the new market. Yes! you read it correct, it is going to be a fresh and new market, for you and your current restaurant too. So what does a new comer in the market does? What pre-launch preparation he does ? What he wants to boast about before and after the launch? 

Lemme tell you if you want to survive in this new market once this Covid-19 lockdown in India is over, you have to work upon one and only ONE thing and it is your RE-BRANDING & MARKETING! Yes, people must NOT forget your name from the market! and people must know what you are going to offer after the market is open. Obviously you are going to bank upon takeaway orders initially for few weeks or can be a month or two! Now when you know about this right now, then you can always cut short your staffing according to the needs of a take-away joint. Service guys can be asked to work on stipends for a month or can be motivated for the salary in coming month in part payments. Good ones will stay with you! Don't worry. 

DO NOT worry about staffing for next few months at-least, because their will be plenty of manpower available, filtered out from those restaurants who did not survived the impact. A great possibility of salary negotiation too. 

Work upon the ZERO waste menu. Do some research, ZERO waste menu is something where the only food waste is the stuff which once cannot digest or is toxic/not recommended to eat. For planned ZERO waste menu you may contact here and you might get some professional help if needed. 

Get a nice air purifier and alkaline water purifier if possible. Why? well apart from the health benefits, this thing is going to help you a lot in your re-launch event, how? We gonna talk in points mentioned below in a while. Their are hotel grades version for kitchen and guest area as cheap as 40k . 

Try to arrange your in-house delivery guy, so that you can save upon the commissions from Swiggy & Zomato, as their will be good number of delivery orders, saving upon the commission can save you your one month electricity bill for sure! Will tell you the ways to promote your own contact .

NOW: All is set you have done all of the above mentioned points, asked your landlord to waive off your rent and luckily he agreed! :) 

Its 10 days left now before lockdown gets over, what next? 

BOOST YOUR INTERNET / INSTAGRAM / YOUTUBE / FACEBOOK WITH ALL THE ENERGY YOU GOT! 

Now its time to hit hard with a well planned hospitality grade digital marketing campaign which is going to make your customers and as well as the potentially new customers about the things you have got for them once the market is open.

Its time to showcase your new ZERO waste menu with cool offers, you are going to shout about the healthy environment your outlet is going to offer to your staff as well as the people who walk in, you are going to boast about the alkaline way of cooking meals, you are going to boast about all the reasons you have for your existing customers as well as new customers to visit. 

A WELL PLANNED DIGITAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN TAILORED FOR HOTEL AND RESTAURANT NEEDS IS AN ONLY WAY WHICH CAN HELP YOU GET OUT OF THIS MESS AND HELP YOU SURVIVE THE CRASH.  

WHEN HIRING ANY DIGITAL MEDIA EXPERT, ASK THEM ABOUT THEIR KNOWLEDGE IN THE FIELD OF HOTEL/RESTAURANT OR F&B SECTOR. Why? Because if they know the 01s of F&B industry then they will be able to target your clients, menu promotions, promotions of your other food services easily. You just need to tell them WHAT YOU WANT. Rest you can leave all upon them, the deals, promo etc too, remember the points mentioned above, and don't worry! Situation is all fine, what is required ? a bit of creativity and vision.

"Jio blocking Reddit in Assam It's not just Reddit, certain sites (not porn sites, I assure you) are showing connectivity issues. Even if they connect, the speeds are too slow to even load a page within 2 mins making browsing a nightmare. Connection to VPN services are failing. Certain videos in YouTube suddenly stop playing leading to an endless buffer. It seems like the caching of YouTube in my local servers is being interrupted midway.

Sometimes these issues suddenly subside for about an hour and again come back. But the trend of these outages seems to be intentional rather than a network fault.

Is this a DNS thing? I don't think so. I've been using Google DNS since forever and I've just checked.

Everything else is just massively interruptive. Connecting sometimes and some other times, not. But the Reddit block is constant and absolute.

&amp;#x200B;

**Edit:** VPN is working now on optimal speeds. Still can't access Reddit without VPN.

**Edit 2:** YouTube is also working perfectly now. What is happening? I just made this post and everything seems to be going back to normal. Now, just Reddit is left to be unblocked and I'll have no complaints.

Now I've been doing this for more than 8 years and I'm educated in art and multimedia design, and classically trained in print advertising. I'm also a graphic designer. So I know what I'm doing and I know what I'm talking about, as do the other volunteers. 

Now, India. Whenever we get an upload from India it's almost always a case of the following:

1. The work is terrible. Over use of vignette, blur, exposure, saturation. 
2. It's a ridiculous portrait. For example, some guy sitting on the roof of a Ferrari. 
3. It's almost always men of various ages working on images of themselves. Really over-acted poses and stares. Just, shit really, no matter how it's analysed. 
4. Despite the fact that it's a helping forum with clear instructions to post AND ask your questions, Indian work is NEVER posted up with any questions. It's just posted and left like, *""Look at my awesome work!""*

Now I'm not biased or racist or generalising and if you think I am, I couldn't give a shit. This is based on 8 years of experience and the simple, statistical reality of almost all posts that come in to our site from India. No other country's people act this way on our site. Every one else mostly posts reasonably good work of general artistic topics and asks for help on some level. Not Indians. It's always vain, childish trash that none of us volunteers can even begin to understand, and when we offer feedback (which is usually not positive but always polite) we meet incredible resistance. Like how dare we critique work and offer suggestions to work that is posted to our free art critiquing website? It's not a gallery. It's a help and critique site made very clear by all the comments and critique publicly displayed, **as well as** the rules stated upon posting. 

Even if you look at our collective ban list right now. 248 people banned in 8 years. 233 of them registered as being from India. 

So what's up with this, India? How do I better understand what's going on here? How do I help you to help yourselves? Why is your art and photography so self-centred, vain, and forgive me, just plain terrible, and why won't you listen to **free**, professional advice on a free, professional advice website that **you came to**?",Photography

"[Serious] Doctors of India, why do we still have something like B.A.M.S My friend recently matched with a girl on tinder who is studying B.A.M.S ie. **Bachelor of Ayurvedic Medicine and Surgery .**

I know that ayurveda is a thing but I see doctors in maharashtra opening clinics with a B.A.M.S degree. Why?

My friend told me that during their date, she said that how ayurveda can be helpful and cheap and everyone should go to an ayurvedic doctor before going to those ""expensive"" doctors.

Even in the link provided, it is said that its a pseudo science and the graduates don't know basic clinical skills.

There are more than 300 colleges in India which provide this degree.

One more question - Is there any money in this? My friend liked her and he wants to have another date with her but is sceptical of her future profession. Will she be able to earn money after getting the degree because I can't think of any hospital who would hire here.

"Amidst the continuing assault on privacy within the country, here's one more scam from which you can't escape. (NPR data) The next round of recording biometric and family­tree details of Indian citizens under the National Population Register (NPR) will be conducted in September 2020, a government notification said. The exercise is different from the decennial Census and is not linked to the National Register of Citizens (NRC).

The objective of the NPR is to create a comprehensive identity database of every usual resident in the country. The database would contain demographic as well as biometric particulars. 

The exercise was conducted earlier in two phases in 2010 and 2015, a senior government official said. For the purpose of the NPR, a usual resident is defined as a person who has resided in a local area for six months or more or a person  
who intends to reside in that area for the next six months or more.

Earlier, the roll out of NPR had slowed down due to overlapping with that of Aadhaar. “In pursuance of subrule(4) of rule 3 of the Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003, the Central government hereby decides to prepare and update the Population Register...... And the field work for house­to­house enumeration throughout the country except Assam for collection of information relating to all persons who are usually residing within the jurisdiction of local registrar shall be undertaken between the 1st day of April 2020 to 30th September 2020,” said a notification issued by Vivek Joshi, Registrar General of Citizen Registration and Census Commissioner.

**It is mandatory for every usual resident of India to register in the NPR.**

[https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/centre-to-ready-npr-for-pan-india-nrc/article28808817.ece](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/centre-to-ready-npr-for-pan-india-nrc/article28808817.ece)

Here's couple of arguments that one may present in favour of such an exercise:

1. It iS a DuTy aS CiTiZeNs of InDiA!!  
Counter: Then why is there an Aadhaar already in place.
2. It WiLL help wEeD oUt thE ILlegaL ImMiGraNts:  
Counter: Are you saying that NRC is a failure?
3. iT wAs Al$0 coNdUCted in 2010, duRinG UPA's RuLe!  
Counter: Bhai tab Aadhaar nahi tha.

Leaving the fun aside, why is this duplication of works being legitimised by the government? Why have an Aadhaar, NRC and NPR all together when any one of the three can perfectly suffice. Even if there are minute differences in the three, why doesn't some ""intelligent"" guy just roll all these up into one?

As far as I'm concerned, Aadhaar and NPR sound the same to me. Just imagine the magnitude of funds involved in any one and then multiply it by 3. That's what it will cost to implement all the three country-wide. This government is really hungry to know all about you- where you go, where do you live, what do you do, whom do you support, who are you in a relationship with...

Talking about redundancy, I'll give you one very specific example. I'm from Gandhinagar, Gujarat. I have witnessed the ""Gujarat Model"" in work. They have a fookin' ""Children's University"" there, which is supposedly ""teaching"" expecting mothers how to deal with pregnancy. I have never seen anyone exit or enter the premises, which sprawls over almost 3 to 4 football fields. THIS, when you have a nation-wide scheme of ASHA workers and Anganwadi doing the same bloody job and even more.

This ""Children's University"" is a classic example of diverting funds into literally defunct areas, making bloody artificial quotations for artificial demands and then hogging that hard-earned public money.

They say the roads of Gujarat are smooth AF don't they? Well no one told you that the same road are rebuilt literally every 6 months with poor materials so they there's a need to remake them again in another 6-8 months. Imagine the amount of money involved in each tender! And these roads are smooth only for the outer regions. The road right in front of my house wasn't rebuilt for almost 5 years and it deteriorated like hell.

"I am from Shaheen Bagh and I hope the protest here ends. I remember the day of violence at Jamia university. I had just come from office and one of my friend who was in the rally that had tried marching towards parliament and as soon as it had reached Mathura Road, a major road in Delhi, the rally faced an unexpected amount of force from police, a violent lathi-charge. He said, people ran in all directions and cops chased them all over. Next thing he sees is buses burning, police firing gun on protestors. 

All I said to him is, "" I wish people didn't protest because this will not yield anything"", he didn't believe me so, I switched on my TV and showed him the narrative that was spun on the incident by media. He was shocked. Next day Shaheen Bagh protest started and rest is history. But never once did I think from day one that BJP will talk or courts will intervene. And never believed that this was a good idea as Shaheen Bagh road is major thoroughfare between Noida , Delhi, Faridabad and Gurgaon and hence it will only make more haters because I know most people don't really care what the Indian Muslim thinks. 

It has all come true, and today as more than ever, I wish this protest ended. 

I was brought up in India and never did I consider this country to be more than a Hindu nation, with Muslims living in their ""aukaat"". I grew up watching Mahabharata, Ramayana and om namah shivay on government owned national television, visited government offices with temples and other unlimited signs of Hinduism in government that established that. As you grew older, met kids who had never met a Muslim and knew zilch about Islam but could tell you 100s of stereotypes about Muslims as facts. Countless incidents made an imprint on you and you learnt to keep your head down and just live in your ghetto. But now my ghetto, which is chose for security over facilities is gone. 

But the thing is, I had learnt to live with that. But this protest makes me feel unsafe. I feel noticed. I don't want that. Till this protest , nobody knew what was Shaheen Bagh, I liked that. Now I feel exposed and worried that I might have crossed my ""aukaat"" and will soon feel the punishment for it. So please my friends at the protest, please stop it.



PS: just my rant, thought, don't downvote because you don't agree, kindly comment or else move on.

Edit : I also do not want the protest to end. You have to understand that as a Muslim in India, I am used to keeping my head down and going on with life. But this, this is totally new. This is a revolt of a sort, which totally makes lots of people among us nervous, we get these thoughts and I just articulated it here. Thank you all for the support and understanding.",Scheduled

### 1) SARS-­CoV-­2 

* A paper published in a recent issue of the peer­reviewed, open­access journal ‘Emerging Microbes and Infections’ has cautioned that SARS­-CoV-­2, the virus causing the COVID-­19 outbreak, is being shed through multiple routes, so testing through oral swabs alone might not be sufficient
* A paper by Wei Zhang, et al, all from the CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, says investigations on patients in a local hospital infected with the virus revealed the presence of SARS-CoV-­2 in anal swabs and blood as well. What’s more, more anal swabs than oral swabs tested positive at a later stage of infection. Since COVID­19 is believed to be a disease of the respiratory tract, usually only oral swabs are used for diagnosis, and discharge is based on the oral swabs testing negative. The anal positives suggested, they argued, shedding through the oral ­fecal route, and therefore transmission is possible as well. The researchers also showed that a serology test (testing blood for antibodies) can improve detection positive rate, and thus should be used in the future.
* As part of the research, samples ­ including oral swabs, anal swabs and blood were collected by Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital. Two investigations were performed the paper describes ­ In the first investigation, samples were taken from 39 patients, 7 of whom were in a ‘severe condition’. In the second investigation, samples were lifted from 139 patients, whose clinical records were not available.
* When counting all swab positives together, we found most of the positives came from oral swab (8/10, 80%) on day 0. However, this trend appears to change on day 5. We found more (6/8, 75%) anal swab positive than oral swab positive (4/8, 50%)
* The data suggested a shift from more oral positives during the early period to more anal positives during the later period
* The current strategy for the detection of viral RNA in oral swabs used for 2019­nCoV diagnosis is not perfect. The virus may be present in anal swabs or blood of patients when oral swabs detection negative
* This observation implies that a patient cannot be discharged purely based on oral swabs testing negative, and the researchers go on to make a recommendation to do serological tests to confirm the status

#### About Coronaviruses

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.

#### What is COVID-19?

COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.

#### About SARS

The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are related to each other genetically, but they are different. SARS is more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19. There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since 2003.

### 2) G20 Meeting in Saudi Arabia

* Recently, the ministers and central bankers from the world’s largest economies participated in the G20 meeting held in Riyadh (Saudi Arabia).
* It was presided by Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is the first Arab nation to hold the G20 presidency.
* The 2020 G20 Presidency will focus discussions, forums, working groups and Ministerial Meetings under the theme of “Realizing Opportunities of the 21st Century for All”.

#### Key Points

* Global Economy:
   * The global economic growth remains slow and downside risks due to the geopolitical and remaining trade tensions, and policy uncertainty.
   * Though the economic growth is expected to increase in 2020 and 2021 due to loose monetary policy and an easing of trade tensions.
* IMF’ Views at the Meeting:
   * It projects a “V-shaped, rapid recovery” for the global economy, but it warns about the uncertainty around the spread of the coronavirus (COVID 19).
   * The IMF also warned about other risks including rising debt levels in some countries as well as climate change.
* Demand for Global Taxation System:
   * It discussed ways to achieve consensus on a global taxation system for the digital era by the end of 2020.
   * It aims to allow governments to tax digital companies where they do business, rather than where they are registered for tax purposes.
   * India has also demanded closer collaboration between international revenue agencies to investigate the tax affairs of offenders who cross borders for escaping tax investigation.

#### G-20

* About
   * The G20 is an informal group of 19 countries and the European Union, with representatives of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
   * The G20 membership comprises a mix of the world’s largest advanced and emerging economies, representing about two-thirds of the world’s population, 85% of global gross domestic product, 80% of global investment and over 75% of global trade.
* Headquarter
   * The G20 operates as a forum and not as an organization. Therefore, it does not have any permanent secretariat or management and administrative structure.
* Origin
   * 1997-1999 Asian Financial Crisis: This was a ministerial-level forum that emerged after G7 invited both developed and developing economies. The finance ministers and central bank governors began meeting in 1999.
   * Amid the 2008 Financial Crisis, the world saw the need for a new consensus-building at the highest political level. It was decided that the G20 leaders would begin meeting once annually.
* Members
   * The members of the G20 are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the European Union.
   * One nation holds the Chair every year, known as the 'G20 Presidency'. Argentina chaired the G20 summit of 2018 and Japan for 2019.
* V-Shaped Recovery
   * A V-shaped recovery is characterized by a sharp economic decline followed by a quick and sustained recovery.
   * The recession of 1953 is an example of a V-shaped recovery.
   * A V-shaped recovery is different from an L-shaped recovery, in which the economy stays in a slump for a prolonged period.

### 3) International Judicial Conference 2020

The International Judicial Conference 2020 was held from 21st-23rd February 2020 in New Delhi.

* The Conference was organized by the Supreme Court of India.
* The theme of the Conference was ‘Judiciary and the Changing World’.
* Important Topics of discussion at the conference included :
   * Gender Justice,
   * Contemporary Perspectives on Protection of Constitutional Values,
   * Dynamic Interpretations of the Constitution in a Changing World,
   * Harmonization of Environment Protection vis-à-vis Sustainable Development and
   * Protection of Right to Privacy in the Internet Age.

#### Highlights from the Conference

* Sustainable Development: The Indian judiciary was appreciated for its balance between development and environment, and continued guidance in it.
   * E.g. Judgement on Sardar Sarovar Project
* Increased Accessibility: The Supreme Court was hailed for the “extraordinary effort” to make its judgments more accessible to the common man by making them available in nine vernacular languages, keeping in mind the nation’s linguistic diversity.
* Gender Justice: The recent directives for granting equal status to women in the Army, guidelines for preventing sexual harassment at the workplace, etc. were appreciated.
* Global Reference: The Chief Justice of India said that the Supreme Court’s judgments are cited by courts of other countries and have served as a “beacon of hope” to independent and developing nations.
   * A 2001 verdict of the South African court cited the Indian case of Narain Das Jain v Agra Nagar Mahapalika decided by the Supreme Court in 1991 to benchmark the compensation to be provided while acquiring land.
* Use of ICT: The need for technology was highlighted to deliver speedy justice.
* The Government is making an effort to connect every court of the country to the E-court Integrated Mission Mode Project. The establishment of the National Judicial Data Grid will make court procedures easier.
* Future Challenges: It was highlighted that issues like data protection and cybercrimes pose new challenges for the judiciary.

#### E-court Integrated Mission Mode Project

* The E-Courts Project was conceptualized based on the ""National Policy and Action Plan for Implementation of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in the Indian Judiciary - 2005"" submitted by the e-Committee of the Supreme Court of India (set up in 2004).
* The main objectives of the e-Court Project are as follows:
   * To provide efficient & time-bound citizen-centric service delivery.
   * To develop, install & implement decision support systems in courts.
   * To automate the processes to provide transparency of Information access to its stakeholders.
   * To enhance judicial productivity both qualitatively & quantitatively, to make the justice delivery system affordable, accessible, cost-effective & transparent.
* The e-Courts National portal (ecourts.gov.in) was launched in 2013. This provides Case Status, daily Case-list, Cases Filed and Cases Registered through the Case information System (CIS) Software.
* The National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG) is a part of the e-Courts Integrated Mission Mode Project. It was launched in 2015. The aim is to track judicial performance across different courts in the country.
   * The NJDG is working as a National data warehouse for case data including the orders/judgments for Courts across the country.
   * NJDG works as a monitoring tool to identify, manage & reduce pendency of cases.
   * It also helps to provide timely inputs for making policy decisions to reduce delay and arrears in the system, facilitate better monitoring of court performance and systemic bottlenecks, and, thus, facilitate better resource management.
   * NJDG has specifically helped India improve its ranking in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Report.

### 4) Craspedotropis Gretathunbergae

A group of scientists has recently discovered a new species of land snail in Brunei.

* The new species reside in tropical rainforests and are sensitive to drought and extreme temperatures (which have become more frequent due to climate change).
* Hence as an honor to Swedish Climate Change activist Greta Thunberg, who has been making efforts to raise awareness about climate change, the new snail species was named Craspedotropis Gretathunbergae.
* Recently, a tiny species of beetle was also named after her as Nelloptodes Greta.
* In 2018, a new species of beetle (Grouvellinus Leonardodicaprioi) was named after the actor Leonardo DiCaprio (an American actor, producer, and environmentalist).

### 6) Joint Commands

Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) office is working on a tentative timeline for the establishment of joint commands among the three defense services Army, Navy and Air Force beginning with an Air Defence Command.

#### Joint Commands

* It is a unified command in which the resources of all the services are unified under a single commander looking at a geographical theatre.
* Meaning, a single military commander, as per the requirements, will have the resources of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force to manage a security threat.
* Functions of joint command:
   * The commander of a joint command will have the freedom to train and equip his command.
   * He will have the logistics of all the services at his beckoning.
   * However, the three services will retain their independent identities as well.
* Joint command at present:
   * There are two tri-services commands at the moment.
   * The joint command at the moment, the Andaman and Nicobar Command (ANC), is a theatre command, which is headed by the chiefs of the three services in rotation. It was created in 2001 after a Group of Ministers had given a report on national security following the Kargil War.
   * The Strategic Forces Command was established in 2006 and is a functional tri-services command.
* What is the structure right now?
   * There are 17 commands, divided among the three services.
   * The Army and the Air Force have seven commands each, while the Navy has three commands.
   * These commands report to their respective services and are headed by three-star officers.
   * Though these commands are in the same regions, they are no located together.
* Need for joint commands?
   * The leader of unified command has control over more varied resources, compared to the heads of the commands under the services now. And the officer commanding will have access to the Air Force’s fighter jets and can use them if needed. Through such integration and jointness, the three forces will be able to avoid duplication of resources. The resources available under each service will be available to other services too. The services will get to know one another better, strengthening cohesion in the defense establishment.
* Do the militaries of other countries have such commands?
   * Several major militaries are divided into integrated theatre commands. China’s People’s Liberation Army has five theatre commands: Eastern, Western, Northern, Southern and Central. Its Western Theatre Command is responsible for India. The US Armed Forces have 11 unified commands, of which seven are geographic and four functional commands. Its geographic commands are Africa, Central, European, Indo-Pacific, Northern, Southern, and Space. Cyber, Special Operations, Transportation and Strategic are its functional commands.

### 7) World’s largest cavefish discovered in Meghalaya

A team of experts from the UK, Switzerland, and India have discovered the world’s largest species of cavefish in Meghalaya’s Jaintia Hills.

#### About

* The cavefish, similar in anatomy to an endangered mahseer species, is around one and a half feet in length and was found inside a remote cave in Jaintia Hills.
* The fish has no eyes and is white due to a lack of melanin pigmentation.
* As they live in a nutrient-limited environment most of these species are small.

### 8) Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR)

* The State Government of Arunachal Pradesh intends to build a highway through the 862 sq km Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR) in East Kameng district.
* The Government had in the past built a highway through the Namdapha National Park.

#### Key Points

* The project is named the East-West Industrial Corridor which is a proposed elevated corridor at the tiger reserve, to be constructed at an estimated cost of Rs.2,550 crore.
* The highway aims to connect Bhairabhunda in West Kameng district and Myanmar in Changlang district along Arunachal Pradesh’s border with Assam.
* The argument over an elevated corridor at the PTR was that it can ensure the free movement of wild animals.
* The state government felt the project would enhance connectivity and develop the state’s foothill areas into economic and industrial zones.

#### Issue Area

* Trees may have to be felled and pillars erected from the ground. Petrol, diesel and other materials will be transported, leading to loss of natural habitat.
* This corridor will be a threat to the adjoining Nameri Tiger Reserve in Assam too.

#### What should the Govt. do?

* The Government, while building such a mega project, should consult renowned conservation organizations in the area and also bring all stakeholders who will be impacted by the project on to the negotiating table.

#### Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR)

* It lies in the foothills of the Eastern Himalaya in the East Kameng district of Arunachal Pradesh.
* It falls within the Eastern Himalaya Biodiversity Hotspot.
* Pakke is also the only Hornbill sanctuary in India.
* The vegetation is predominantly tropical semi-evergreen forest.
* What makes PTR special are the brilliant efforts of the Forest Department and local communities like that of the Nyishi Tribe who inhabit the area around the park to protect the wildlife here.

### 9) Amendments in Arms Act, 1959 and Arms Rules, 2016 notified

* Shooting is an important Olympic sport in India. The Indian shooters have excelled in international competitions.

If a shooter is renowned in one event, he can keep maximum eight (previously it was four), if a shooter is renowned in two events he can keep maximum ten (previously it was seven) and if a shooter is renowned in more than two events, he can keep maximum twelve (previously it was seven) firearms under exempted category. The junior target shooter/ aspiring shooter is now allowed to possess two weapons (previously one) of any category in which the person is a junior target shooter/aspiring shooter. This provision shall facilitate shooters in practicing with various types of firearms. Apart from the above exemptions, the shooters are entitled to possess two firearms as normal citizens under provisions of the Arms Act, 1959.
* Similarly, by amending the provision under Rule 40 of the Arms Rules, 2016 the quantity of ammunition that can be purchased by the shooters during the year for the practice has also been increased considerably. As per the new provisions, for .22 LR rifle/pistol 5000 instead of 1000, for another type of Pistol/Revolver 2000 instead of 600 and for shotgun calibers 5000 instead 500 can be purchased by the shooters.
* Apart from this, the Ministry of Home Affairs has also made other necessary amendments in the Arms Rules, 2016 by amending the Arms Act, 1959, vide the Arms (Amendment) Act, 2019.

I know the pay is way better and nothing can match it in India. The working culture and the hours will probably be better too. Even the living conditions and fun and travel and what not.

I am not talking about outright better than US. But is there any hope of ""making it"" by staying right here, in India? Being at the top of you game making may be around 30-40% of what they make there? Build some financial cushion and attain some luxury, somewhere near to the guys over there?

"Went to an Indian Hindu temple in my quest for spiritual learning. Had a very bad experience with 2 people there. Is this part of Indian culture? As a white man, I respect that naturally I will attract attention when in a facility that's predominantly visited by Indians.

I was approached by two people at different times, with the exact same nosy attitude and fired off a series of interrogative questions within the first 3 minutes. I asked them if they can point me towards any spiritual teachings, but instead of answering my question, they shot off one question after the after. 

\- Where are you from?

\- Where do you live?

\- What work do you do?

\- What is your salary?

\- Are you married? Why not?

\- What do your parents do?

I didn't want to be rude, given I am a guest in a facility and I had no idea who these guys were. The second one started ordering me around, like ""sit there"", ""put your hands like this"", ""don't look there, look here"" etc. I gained no spiritual insight - just an encounter with a control freak and some very bad mannered people.

Z921 in their rant on another thread here:
> You need to have a hobby other than photography

Who are you to decide what hobby is worth my time? Sounds like you are the kind of person to micro-manage your employees and be on people's shoulders like vedhal is to vikramadithya. Also sounds like you are/will be the kind of parent who does not like what their child is doing and would like him/her to study engineering.

> DumbwitPatra:
> What is your expectation from an employer? How can I, as an employer, assess you and be sure you're unlike the others? Jobs ARE available. But the people aren't knowledgeable enough. Even engineering passouts with 80-85% can't crack simple dynamic programming questions. I hire based on a coding test I give on hackerrank. And out of 400+ CS engineers from tier 1 collegee, only 15 or 20 students (per college) could get three questions right in 3.5 hours. Because we want coders who have strong basics, we hire only there's people. If you're one among them, you'll get a job. If you aren't, you need to have visible proof that you have put in efforts to specialize in a particular field. The guy who is leading the AI team in my company is from BBA background. He learnt AI and math from the internet, built some applications and had content that would show his efforts. If you do have something like that, take your idea to a hackathon. You'll have your idea recognized even if you don't win and will get a job. However, I'm not sure if i understood your question right. What are you expecting from your employer and what change do you want to see in the way hiring is done?

Quantitative Aptitude exams. The messages you are sending to your prospective employees are:

* You only care about speed and memorizing power and nothing else about the developer because all your talk of github profiles and other hobbies does not come into play until you see my resume yourself which is usually after all the written rounds.
* For all the talk of being the risk takers in the industry, you don't want to trust your prospective employee so you pass up on a potentially good employee who may not have the best aptitude test taking skills.

What you expect to happen:

* You assume good aptitude problem skills imply good problem solving skills.
* You assume people won't game the aptitude round and learn just enough to pass that round.
* You assume that all the brilliant programmers solve the problems in no time and you are left with a roster of excellent developers.

What usually happens:

* People game the system and just study how to solve the test problems.
* Actually good developers may not have the time to study aptitude problems because, surprise! they are busy learning actual programming. Many good developers get filtered out in the first round due to the lack of knowledge in aptitude.

> I hire based on a coding test I give on hackerrank. And out of 400+ CS engineers from tier 1 collegee, only 15 or 20 students (per college) could get three questions right in 3.5 hours. Because we want coders who have strong basics, we hire only there's people.

15 or 20 students per college seems like the right amount of students who are actually passionate about their field. When the stakes are high, Skills go down a few notches. It's the observer effect. As soon as people find out they are being assessed or being watched they don't perform as well.

> What are you expecting from your employer?

* If you want Tom Cruise as your boyfriend, you need to be Cameron Diaz. If you want brilliant developers, you must be a innovating company who offers their weight in salary and/or Resume Value. If I am a good developer, then it is possible I know my worth. I am not going to put up with you for $400 a month or less.

* Stop taking credit for my work. I once heard that my friend got a pat in the back for making the company $12000. He never got a bonus or saw $1 of that money.

* I want you to stop whining and start treating employees like human beings. Pay them a proper wage and give them interesting problems to solve. Automate the boring stuff. Don't ask me to do the documentation manually. Haven't you heard of tools that do the documentation from comments in code?

* Once I am hired. I want a manager who actually understands what I am saying and not some prison warden who intimidates devs to get things done before a very early deadline that they came up with without consulting the devs. This is a sure way to make devs secretly hate you while burning out.

* I want reasonable work-life balance. I am passionate about programming, but I am a human being too.

* More investment into employee training or undergraduate education in the government. I know IT companies lobby a lot, so I expect them to actually put effort to improve the syllabus of colleges to suit what they want in terms of technical knowledge by diverting some money towards education.

Yes but I am not the one whining about not finding good developers. It is the employers looking for good developers but are not willing to pay them a living wage.

> People working as game testers for ₹10000 per month

There is your problem. Why are you not willing to pay more?

I am not personally looking for a job. I have one. It is good but I notice the bad side of IT occasionally. Namely the ""this will do"" attitude from people who expect a lot for less. It's about managing your expectations as an employer when you are asking your employees to manager their expectations of their salary.

"Have a few questions regarding CAA  1. What is the total number of immigrants/refugees that will come under the purview of CAA? The only information I could dig up was the comment by Union Minister G Kishan Reddy who said the exact data for determining the number of eligible refugees for citizenship under the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) was yet to be prepared. CAA protestors and supporters seem to have very different numbers for this.  
2. Given that the cutoff date for CAA is 31.12.2014 - what kind of proof a persecuted person is expected to provide for proving his entry into India before said date? Also, what are provisions for refugees belonging to mentioned religions in CAA but entering India after the cut-off date?  
3. CAA is said to cover only persecution on basis of religion and not persecution on grounds of race, gender, membership of a political or social group, language, ethnicity, etc. But what is the yardstick for classifying or ascertaining this?  
4. NRIC and CAA are two sides of the same coin and as such cannot be viewed separately. Who is a 'doubtful citizen' under Sub-rule (4) of Rule 4 of the 2003 Rules, which says that ""during the verification process of the Population Register (or NPR), a step before the NRIC is prepared, an individual or a family would be marked as ""doubtful"" citizen or have ""doubtful citizenship"". It is neither defined in the 2003 Rules nor in the Citizenship Act of 1955. There is no clarity as to how local authorities will identify and decide on who is a doubtful citizen.  
5. Given that the NRC exclusion rate in Assam was approximately 6%, are we looking at exclusion of at least 7.86 crores of people? Will CAA act as a safety net for said people who belong to Hindu, Sikh, Jain, Buddhist, Christian & Parsi communities?- a narrative that is being focussed by CAA protesters. What happens to people from communities (Muslims & others) who are excluded from NRIC and do not fall under CAA - Do they end up going before Foreigners Tribunals as in the case of NRC exclusion in Assam?  
6. What is the total number of illegal Bangladeshi immigrants in Assam and what percentage of those will be eligible under CAA? The only info I got is Sriprakash Jaiswal, Union Minister of State for Home Affairs, made a statement in Parliament on 14 July 2004 put the total number of illegal Bangladeshi immigrants in India at 20 million with the Majority being in West Bengal & Assam.",CAA-NRC-NPR

"Indian mentality. This is something that I wanted to get off my chest. India got its independence in 1947 but even now indirectly we are under the rule of westerners.

Let me start with education

Our curriculum is such that , innovation and creativity is killed, we are trained and educated in such a way that we can work under the huge MNC's operated by westerners. Individuality is killed and people are corrupted by the sheep mentality. Higher education is a big joke in this country, those who pursue masters and post docs are those who couldn't land a job(most cases). We still have the slave mindset within us , we want to work for someone, doesn't matter if you like the job but we will work to get paid.The syllabus was designed by the british and we are still following it.

Moving on, we have our economy,

India and Pakistan are the cheapest countries to live in this world, not africa,not venezuela but India. What this essentially means is that if you go to any other country with the same wealth you possess in India, you will become [poorer .](https://poorer.No)  No wonder Americans use Indians for cheap labour. Even after being the cheapest country to live in , we have so many living below poverty line which speaks a lot about wealth distribution in our country. All those who come up with stats regarding GDP, please lookup GDP per person because that's what essentially matters.

We call ourselves a secular country, but ram mandir dispute constantly made headlines. Let me be honest, I dont care about who wins regarding this, but was this really a priority, can't this wait until we have progressed in other important areas?, our healthcare is in such bad condition, the state of the BPL people are pathetic but they want to construct this temple now anyways? Im not asking them to build hospitals in the place instead of the temple, that's foolishness and makes no sense, why can't they spend on healthcare and education first and afterwards think about this temple.

The defense budget is 3.18 lakh crore ,great our army is powerful and is the second largest but what the government fails to realize is that the biggest war is happening inside India. We spend so much preparing for war with other countries that we fail to fight our internal problems. Why can't the budget for healthcare and education be increased by reducing the budget for defense. Now some might argue that countries like USA too spend large o defense but the difference is that they are already developed, they don't have much problems from within whereas we are still a third world country.

All those media hype surrounding how India is a rising superpower is complete bogus, they want us to believe we are making progress so that can make good use of our pathetic situation. The real rising superpower is china, just look at their technological advancements.  

Moving on, we have sports 

The most popular sport in India is cricket. Now let me remind you that cricket was introduced by the british to us and we still play the game widely while they have moved on other sports. cricket is the number one sport only in 2 countries , India and pakistan both which were ruled by british. We are indirectly still slaves, we play the same sport they gave us even after 100 years. 

Having a population of about 1.4billion, our representation in olympics wont even equal countries which have population less than 10 million. Thats how pathetic is the condition of sports in India.

People just dont care, dont watch and don't play other sports, we simply aren't told to do so and so we refrain from playing others, only if this mentality changes will we progress in other sports, we can't just blame the government for not funding, if people aren't watching how will they fund. 

Moving on, we have women safety

Women safety is a big joke in India, Indian culture teaches us to respect women but why is the situation so pathetic.

Clearly this is because of lack of education and lack of sex education.

We wrote kamasutra, but now talking about sex is taboo. Indian schools treat sex as a foreign topic and most schools just outright skips this topic. When you say sex is taboo, it increases the curiosity in the mind of people, people crave most what they don't get/understand and like adding oil to fire we have all bollywood movies objectifying women which corrupts the weak minded and thus they give in to their sexual feelings.  

Sex education is important to understand and control one's feelings. 

I created a Fake facebook id, with a woman's picture as the profile picture and I got 879 friend requests within a day, most of them being indians, and I got 100 pm's asking me for nude pics. This level of desperation will ultimately lead to them becoming rapists and [molesters. No](https://molesters.No)   wonder women dislike Indian men.

And finally I want to end with bollywood

Most of the actors are light skinned and have features similar to europeans.Almost half of the actresses are NRI who eith er lived in england or USA.

This clearly shows that we still subconsciously are being slaves, we consider light skinned more superior, we feel they deserve more respect and this mentality should be changed if we really want progress in our society.",Sports

"Major Crisis in KA Government The JDS - Congress coalition government in KA is in a major crisis. At least 10 Congress and 3 JDS MLAs have resigned in supposed protest against their respective parties. More resignations are expected.

The crisis is grave because several of those who resigned are senior leaders, ideologues not just opportunists.

None of these have joined BJP and have explicitly mentioned that their decision was not related to BJP.

The background context is that last election had no clear mandate. BJP won the largest number of seats but not enough to form a government. JDS and Congress formed a post-poll coalition and formed the government. But they were so incompatible that they could not even fight the LS elections united. Result BJP won landslide in LS polls.

Anyways this is a shocking development and points seriously to the extent of dysfunction in both Congress and JDS and their associates.

Veterans like Ramalinga Reddy (Congress) and Vishwanath (JDS) walking out is earth shattering in these parts of the world.

"How bad would gifting a smartphone to a teenager be? Hey guys!

I am in a bit of a dilemma and could really use some help from here. My 16 year old cousin passed his 10th class ICSE board exams with flying colors and I asked him what would he like as a gift for his brilliant performance. He asked me for a smartphone (RealMe 3 Pro to be precise. Damn kid XD) . Now I'm in a fix!

I think getting his own personal smartphone at this age is not going to be a good idea. He is a good kid, sincere, motivated and hardworking, and seeing him deteriorate in his 11th and 12th would be really painful. I have seen him around smartphones and trust me, he's a leech! Despite not having his own smartphone, he would be glued to my aunt's or my uncle's (his parents) phones during his 8th and 9th standard. So much that he would remain standing beside the socket while the phone gets charged and he plays his games. There was strictness from his parents during 10th standard and it worked since till 10th, kids are still kids, but I don't think the same can be enforced now. Besides, my aunt-uncle are simple, laid-back pahadi folks who would probably give up after 2-3 explanations/arguments from his side. They wouldn't bug him much. They are not the super educated, urban parents with whom their kids share everything and the parents discuss safe sex/menstruation with them. (Out of context examples??)

I think if his parents remain strict and restrict his usage and specially avoid giving it to him at nights, it would be still okay but such restrictions are hard to do any good to the parent-kid relationship(which is not much in this case) and also, kids are smart at sneaking ;) I used to take my dad's Nokia brick (not even a smartphone LoL) all the time after he fell asleep to chat with my friends when I was in 11th. I am not saying all kids are the same but I hope you get my point.

I understand it all boils down to how sincere the kid is and I am also sure there are many who don't get that distracted and use their phones responsibly. Its just that I don't wanna see my little brother waste his time. Phones are SUPER distracting.

So, what do I do? Any parents here who could monitor their kid's usage and can vouch that phone aren't that bad IF proper supervision is there? Any big brothers/sisters' experiences who gifted their young siblings phones and regretted it? People who got phones after 10th and can give some insight who badly/responsibly they used it? (I didn't get one after 10th. I bought one after entering college after collecting reward money for some months from various relatives for good 12th marks LoL)

PS : Fun conversation from sometime in this January that I remembered. My husband asked him, ""So you also play PUBG like other kids these days?"" ""Na, I don't"" Husband, "" Thats good! Aajkal to sab deewaane hai. (Everyone's crazy these days for it"" ""Yeah, but mummy ke phone me chalta nahi, kaise khelu? (Doesn't work in mom's phone. What do I do?"". Husband amused.",AskIndia

"Unpopular Opinion: Get a DTH if you are a sports fan in India Let me start by saying that Hotstar and SonyLiv have really bad quality, specially for live streaming.

Literally any pirated 1080p stream will be better than Hotstar.

Now, people here really hate DTH connections and for good reasons, however those reasons don't apply for sports channels. You won't get ads in football, and you'll get ads in Cricket on Hotstar too. Further, the new TRAI regulations made packs costlier for those who want many channels, but really cheap for those who only buy it for few channels. You can just get rid of any base pack you're given, and need to pay a monthly fee of 153 rupees for Network Charges, and 23 rupees for Star Sports 1 HD and 23 rupees for Sony Ten 1 HD, paying less than 200 rupees per month in total.

"In view of current state of economy, wasn't idea of Basic Monthly Income, an worthwhile experiment ? To people who oppose govt giving sops to people, here is my argument.

Since economy works with buy-sell of products and services, current slowdown can be attributed to 

A. Cash crunch in hands of citizens. (I mean income, not currency notes)

B. Oversupply of pricey products.

C. Lowered consumer sentiment.

Etc etc... You must have got my point by now...


Since GST and demonetization, money from parallel market is invested (cough! Real estate! Cough! Gold!) And any bulk sale of these asset will raise suspicion.

Thus it's slowdown.

And since people are waiting for things to be rosy again, they are willing to wait for luxuries.

Now comes BMI. 

IF govt decides to push money to poor households...

Purchasing power of poor will multiply manyfolds.

And assuming, they will go buying...

Economy might revert back to health.

Basis for my understanding: was talking to a prof of commerce. Was talking about  current slowdown. When he pointed towards 2008 depression and MNREGA. He explained about the bottom byuoncy which kept local economy in good health despite external flu. This enrichment of lower strata of society with cash flow kept demand high thus subverting depression and subsequent rejuvenation of economy when depression subsided in world economy.

Since MNREGA is still available, on this he told... Economy has now equilibrated with  effect of MNREGA. 

His view about recent spurt of economic activity in Kashmir was favourable.

"Goa is STARVING due to 100% lockdown, and I need you to know about us I cannot take this anymore! The retarded CM of Goa has imposed a full lockdown. This means that NO grocery shops are allowed to open. I might survive for a week by eating a single meal per day with a dangerously compromised immunity during this ongoing pandemic, but think of the numerous infants and elderly dependents who need supplements and special medications and form the most vulnerable sections prone to COVID-19.

**The state of Goa has also breached the centre's direct order by shutting down ALL food supplies and outlets in the state.**

Foreign nationals stuck in the state are already trying to get international media's attention to this crisis , but we need more voices!

The nail in the coffin for me was seeing [THIS](https://twitter.com/ArvindKejriwal/status/1243078456671236098) tweet by Delhi's CM. He's allowed 24X7 operation of all grocery stores in his jurisdiction which felt like a gut-punch as a Goan. We haven't had fresh supply in nearly five days!

Please do not trust any news outlet or journalists claiming that Goa has things under control. Goan government's policy is literally murdering its own people to tackle COVID-19.

If Corona doesn't get us, starvation surely will. If you can, at the very least, tweet, tag, or shame the Goan administration. It's a total nightmare!  


**EDITS:**

Someone just filed a petition against Goa's government: 

[Advocate Rohit Bras de Sa files letter petition before HC on account of scarcity of essential commodities & lack of machanism to provide basic food supply to vulnerable wage workers, says people of Goa are struggling to find even basic goods to sustain themselves in curfew days](https://twitter.com/prudentgoa/status/1243101931666468869)

If you want to lend your support on Twitter, retweet the following tweet en mass. It's from Zoe, a foreign national, who's been trying to get international media's attention on the issue: 

[Brits & foreigners stranded in Goa, India. The state has closed all shops for past three days.

"An interesting take on Indian elections by Shekhar Gupta at Centre for Policy Research on 'How India Voted' This is going to be a long read but one of the best post-election analysis that I've seen. I have transcribed, paraphrased, and highlighted what Gupta said [here](https://youtu.be/mL5quXQzLkY?t=4925).

Today Congress and the rest can complain about resources but in 2014 Congress was in power and Modi was an outsider and yet he won. To analyse this, we need to forget our voting preferences and admit that Modi’s rise is not a fraud on India. Modi’s is a phenomenon and has had a better story and a better product to sell for almost a decade. 

Since it suited everybody around Congress, they said BJP lost 2004 due to 'India Shining'. Cut down those number : **BJP just got 9 seats less than Congress. BJP lost due to Gujarat 2002 where BJP's previous allies (Mamata, CBN) were no longer willing to ally with them since BJP refused to fire Modi**

**Another myth was spread after 2009 when the incumbent came back with a larger majority than the previous one. Who do you then give credit to? If you credit it to MMS, it’s an outrage in the Congress party.** So you have to find an excuse and credit it to Mrs.Gandhi and whatever she had done. So you say loan waivers and MNREGA. 

In urban areas, where least poor 30% people live Congress party’s strike rate in 2009 was 68%. In the areas where 70% of Indias poorest live, Congress party’s strike rate was 30 something percent. This data was available, and the party was not willing to see the reasons that **India had seen 7 years of breathless growth and because the intellectual establishment and political darbaar of the Congress party was not willing to accept that, they undermined UPA2**,and pushed it back - people got so angry who got used to growth people brought in Modi from Gujarat because he’ll bring you something. 

**In this election campaign, the most striking thing was Modi getting away with saying that nothing happened in this country before 2014** - that history of this country begins in 2014. That is not true. **The previous 10 years had a lot of growth, built a lot of infrastructure - many things happened**. Look at the way global economic downturn was handled by India, it was a great economic success story. Look at how Satyam was handled. But the amazing thing was, in so many days of campaigning I never heard anyone from the Congress party say anything about what their govt did under UPA2. 

**This is the autoimmune disease of the Congress party. This Congress party wants to blame Modi, media - they’re watching the wrong channels. That fact is the only achievements the Congress party was willing to talk about was not even of Rajiv Gandhi but of Indira Gandhi when 80% of the voters are born after Indira Gandhi had passed away.** So don’t blame others. Look inside - the voter is transactional. The transaction for the voters is NREGA money, the gas cylinder, or it can also be the pride/security of the country and how good is the leader. 


**This idea of keeping India secular has been outsourced to it’s 15% muslims. The muslims are fed up because nobody does anything for them but you keep dragging them everywhere as if it’s their responsibility.** *You have to save secularism, I have the Yadavs with me, so and so will bring the Dalits.* Dalits are not with her anymore. She has has 10 seats, Akhilesh has 5 seats. That tells you that Mayawati is finished because Akhilesh has been able to transfer his Muslim votes to her, but she hasn’t been able to transfer her Dalit votes to him. The Dalit votes are now changing.

This time as I drove around the country I would just get ordinary people and ask who are you voting for and why and record it. I have 60 of these recordings. All 60 are voting for Modi. From north KA, south KA, Bengal, UP, Bihar, MP, Rajasthan, Haryana. You can blame media, money, whatever but **if in Haryana if BJP can get 68% vote, and Haryana’s premier Jatt party INLD only gets 1.8% that tells you, that you are looking at something new.** Somebody just had a much better product. So respect the verdict, but for that first you have to first accept that there was a much better product on offer. 

People have been defeated despite money. Look at CBN, he wasn’t short of money in Andhra. **You can have a great organisation but you need to have workers who have the commitment.** Look at what YS Reddy has built in AP. It’s an organisation that can fight BJP anyway. Look at Mamata in WB - if it weren’t for BJP would have gotten 35 seats. 

**The voter in this country does not trust Congress schemes. Anything that happened in the past, very little got to the voter. This time LPG, the house, and toilets. I was looking for evidence to the contrary but we were not finding it. We were finding gas cylinders - we would even peek inside the houses and found gas cylinders. You build a house govt gave you 1.5 lac, you build a toilet and govt gave you 15k. The govt didn’t build anything for you - they used Direct Benefit Transfer. The used the JAM trinity. Jandhan - Aadhar - Mudra loans. Initially I thought Mudra loans were all rubbish and they were all fake. But I have videos of a Dalit saying that I got 50K mudra loans to build a chai shop and I pay 1300 per month back and if I don’t the branch manager comes. Check the data - 4.81 cr have gotten Mudra loans and 2.1 cr loans has been dispensed.**

**I have to say, we journalists and commentariat chose not to see it. Even when we see it, we compulsively tried to deny it. *“Oh they’ve got gas cylinders - but they cant afford the next one”.* But the fact is they got one. *“Oh the next one is full price”* - that is a lie - the next one is not full price. Next one you pay the full price and you get your subsidy back in the Jandhan bank account. But once you have the connection - you’re empowered. Once you have the toilet, *“Oh but water is not there”* - but the water will come. The fact is these people had never seen delivery of anything. And even if they got anything they did not see anything they could get without having to bribe including in most cases the NREGA wages.** So this is a big change. This is a big governance exercise - you may like it or not like it. But smart people will learn from it. KCR did, Babu did it and now Jagan will do it. Non-smart people will complain about. 

It’s wrong to say this is only Hindutva. Hindutva has helped Modi consolidate upper caste. I have never seen any caste vote bank so cohesive. Because they also see him as this guy having protected “merit” . Ensure that these other “faltus” don’t walk into this territory. He has taken away all the other OBC’s simply because caste based parties became family run parties. Because SP &amp; RJD family run Yadav parties - Yadav stayed there, other OBC’s fled. Similarly for Dalits - jatavs became powerful, the rest have fled. 

In a lot of rallies, Rahul spoke out “Chowkidar char hai” - a lot of people spoke out went back saying “Ye angrez Aadmi hai, jo apna desi Aadmi hai aur khudse banke aaya hai use chor bol rahe hai” . There was this video going around where Priyanka was talking about Rahul being black belt, diving,pilot etc. This was being circulated by the other side! The ordinary people were saying they also wanted to dive, become a pilot. So they started asking what does Rahul do that he has so much money. This India hates elitism. Modi is now elite - he dresses well, he’s got style. People say he has earned it unlike you guys who came because your daddy gave it to you.",Politics

"In search for the family of the Indian migrants who are my ancestors I’m not sure if many people in India know about this part of history, but I’ll try to explain what I know as best as I can.

Back at the end of the 19th century, The Netherlands owned Dutch Guyana (now called Suriname), a small piece of land above Brazil that they traded with the English for the piece of land which they eventually created New York on (used to be New Amsterdam). They owned various plantations where slaves used to work. After they decided to abolish slavery, they needed new folks to work the land. 

From what I know, the Dutch struck a deal with the English to get Indian people to work in their colony. These people were told that they would come back rich after a few years of work so they could live like maharajas. A lot of people decided to take the chance, either because they were in a low caste or might have done something against the law in India. They were coming from either Calcutta (my mother’s ancestors) or Bihar (my father’s ancestors).

Does anybody know why they might have chosen to seek their faith in another country? What I know is that many Indians in Suriname decided to add “Singh” to their surname just because that sounds fancier or something. My grandfather tells that his father who came from India barely spoke about his life back there. Does anyone know more about this period and the people that left India? I’m very curious what my ancestors’ lives must have been back then. 

TLDR; great grand parents are from India. Moved to Surinam for work. Now living in the Netherlands. Would like to know more about India from before the move to Surinam.",AskIndia

"Are Indians just a cheap commodity to the world Whilst it's nice to see India represented nicely in the World stage, against the tidal wave of memes about us being Gang Rapists, Street shitters, curry eaters and tribalistic cavemen (I can go on and on big you get the picture)... I feel people look at Indians as a commodity instead of as people. This is a bit of a rant, but I'll elaborate.

For example, before the last Cricket world cup, reddit cricket was awash with a few Footballers and athletes from different sports taking selfies with Indian shirts saying ""I support Team India"".

/Cricket was awash with fawning Indian fans. Granted, I know most will be young fans, but something didn't sit right with me. Its clear that these stars dont even know what cricket is, let alone there is a WC going on.... It was clearly just a PR Strategy. 
The similar thing was done by alot of companies when it comes to Bollywood.

I just found it soooooo patronizing and condescending. They know Indians would eat that shit straight out of their hands. The know quality doesnt mean anything but quantity goes along way. India has a very fad based culture. So consumerism of merchandise is easy $$$ for International companies.

I dont blame the companies, its basic marketing. I just wish Indians would be self aware and appreciate that these people dont give a shit about Indians except our wallets and want us eating out of their hands. We make ourselves look desperate and pathetic.",Sports

"I need advice on how to go forward with this. In the 26 years of my life I've heard my father scream emptily threatening: ""I will commit suicide"" or ""I will give you a divorce"" so much at my mum, that today when he finally screamed the same old things at her, I said ""lets go to the police and court"" to which he said: ""no! why will we go to the court? lets just live separately instead"".
When I continued stressing about going to the court, he angrily stormed off the house with another of his old threats saying ""I will leave this house"". I followed him, just like I've been doing the last couple of times and he went and sat angrily in a park for the next 3 hours while I waited patiently outside, I did not speak a word with him thru this whole ordeal. after which he came back home and rejected having lunch my mum prepared and went off to the office.
that was 10 'o'clock in the morning. I had to skip office today because I was mentally paralysed and had to curl up in bed sleep the entire day.

My father, initially when I was a kid, was both physically and mentally abusive to us, though with time he quit abusing physically but his mental torture became worse. he forced my mum to shut the business she was running and economically strangled her when I was in 4th grade. He cut her ties off both with her family and friends circles and isolated her, He has said and continues to this day say horrendous things to and about her which are completely false and cause irreversible psychological damage to her (extremely low-self esteem, self pity and loathing) 

my childhood memories with him include (to quote a few):
Him taking us all to a lake in our city to jump into and commit suicide one late evening  
Him hitting me with a belt one day after coming home from office.
Him throwing plates with food around the house that my mum cooked and served him.
My mum either being extremely anxious or crying because of him.
His earth-shatteringly loud shouting.
Also recently in the last one year, after researching his behavioural patterns, I figured out that he has Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) the extreme of its kind.
that did help us a bit to understand him and tolerate him better thanks to all the articles and youtube videos available online. me and my mum sat down and discussed strategies and solutions to bear with his behavior without in anyway aggravating it. 
but at least once every month (at least!) he triggers my mum to a point where she just can't keep quiet anymore and then uses that opportunity to belittle her further and further and make her feel like a piece of trash.

I come from an Indian family and live in an extremely conservative society. My mum has, ever since her marriage, been conditioned to fear the society's judgement and insults that will come with divorce. Initially when I was just a baby and she wanted to quit her marriage, she approached her own father who asked her to shut her mouth and learn to deal with it.
she is absolutely terrified of divorce and cannot imagine a life like that and would much rather prefer living in this hell day-in and day-out because a known devil is better than an unknown devil.

I am a 'man' who has just entered his late 20's, but I don't feel man enough, I feel like a child and I find myself behaving like one too. All of my childhood has been extremely depressening with a lot of issues, I was sexually abused as a kid by a family member, bullied in school and failed most of my subjects. And whenever I'm around my father I'm mentally crippled by anxiety. I have stopped speaking with him for the past two years now even though we live in the same house, which he blames my mum every other day for apparently brainwashing us against him.

He gives my mum money that's less than enough to run the house comfortably, even though he earns pretty well, and then she has to beg him for more money, at which point he starts abusing her even more and throws the money at her condescendingly. 
Even though I am slowly becoming financially independent, there is still quite some time before I become absolutely independent, but that doesn't seem to help my case because I cant move out if my mum won't. and even if I did, I'd have to constantly live in the fear of him physically or mentally abusing her with more freedom than ever, with no one around to protect her.",AskIndia

Now coming back to my idea of photography and filmmaking business, it ain't any disruptive business but something I've loved. I have a small portfolio which ain't much impressive, not of any models in the photos but general landscape, street and travel. I don't intend to be the next fashion photographer either. So the idea is leave this work, get to the nearby city, start a photography firm with initially teaching the basics and advance of photography, not the costly ones but even college students which can afford. Side by side, also lectures from the well knowns in the field who might help me get some traction along with what I've been doing. I plan to get some amount of initial money from home for this. Pick up a few students, with some contacts, get some photography paid jobs. Get those students paid with some margin for me, get more contacts and  follow it up. The jobs I tend to initially get are concerts, photoshoots and even weddings. Photography instruments and cameras can be rented. A lot of things I feel I can do. 

But now the only fear is jumping out of my well paying hectic job at this age for something like this. How much harm will it do to my career if I fail out and if I want to go back to my work life again? How do I see the future when this field is jam packed with every photographer and film maker out there. I don't plan to bring anything different in photography but satisfied clients, good photographs and create a team which can deliver this with me. This all as happiness in what I will do and something belonging to me. 

I also thought of doing this after trying out for mba, as it might give me a cushion. Maybe help me out. But again confusing.

So how wild is this? I need some sane suggestions here, haven't asked my family or friends. 

I've not edited any part of this text, just raw, straight out of my confused mind. Please be gentle, already stressed and confused about all directions in career.

tl;dr: 27yo guy, hectic job, wants to leave for starting a photography business with not much experience and not a disruptive business but something just for happiness. Confused guy.",Photography

"How would a Comp. Sc. degree (Univ. of London) be valued in terms of hiring/ future grad programs abroad? I accidentally came across this yesterday

https://www.coursera.org/degrees/bachelor-of-science-computer-science-london

It seems to be a live-saver as I still get to apply for a course I'm interested in and fulfils a general 'bachelors' requirement (messed up 12th marks, so not even eligible for this course in India). I was almost sure the only choice I had was to repeat my exam and apply for a good college next year.

I still have some doubts, how would this be considered during job hiring? Would it carry the stigma, equivalent of a correspondence course in India?

But disregarding job outlook, would I face any issues if I intend to do my Masters abroad? I'm almost sure I want to do mine abroad in a reputed university, but I have also read how difficult it is to get accepted in one. I read somewhere only the likes of IIT/ tier-1 colleges get accepted in a reputed Masters program. Is there any truth to this?",AskIndia

"Non-hiring someone because of his/her family name is considered as cast discrimination ? Hi guys !

I was working for a French start-up in Bengaluru recently. One of my responsibility was to be a part of the recruitment team. 

Once, my boss refuses to hire someone because of his  family name/cast.

To tell you everything, he refuses to hire a ""Gowda"" because he wont fit in our team of low-cast villager people profile. 

(lets not discuss about hiring low-profile people from countryside because they are less complaining and more ""flexible"" to be polite)

Is that considered as cast discrimination by the law ?

What is your opinion about that ?

"Does anyone know how the PMNRF that we are all donating to (Prime Minister National Relief Fund) is utilised? In last year alone, PMNRF had a surpluse of 570.68 crores in 2018-19. As per the FAQs section, these funds can be utilised for medical assistance, floods, drought, terrorist violence and other unforeseen occurrences. Indians who are either affected by these calamities or who require financial aid for treatment of major diseases at Government/PMNRF empanelled hospitals can partially defray the expenses. Has anyone ever directly benefited by the scheme? Funny, FAQ Q18 reads as 'since a large number of requests are received seeking financial assistance for medical treatment, it is not possible to accommodate all requests due to limited resources.'
Limited resources? They had 570.68 crores in surplus from just one year? 
Also it is mentioned that the balance amount(which are significant surplus since 2011-12) is ""invested"" in various forms with scheduled banks and other agencies to ensure long term sustainability. So, about 75% of last year's funds are ""invested""?
We keep getting posts on r/india of doctors working with limited resources and have a lack of proper protective equipments. Why haven't been a lot of these funds transferred in times of crisis or better, for improvement of healthcare facilities? 
Does anyone know about how these funds are disbursed? Is there any answer to why such a huge amount is kept reserved? Has anyone ever directly received financial aids from this fund?

"The character Kabir Singh objectifies women, the movie doesn't. I think people miss this simple point. The characters in the movie behave the way they do because that is their character trait. The filmmaker is not giving you a message, he/she has no bussiness  giving a message or educating the audience. They simply tell a story with the characters they created. 

&amp;#x200B;

Stop criticizing the behavior of the characters in a movie. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the film Kabir Singh/Arjun Reddy, it is highly possible that the protagonist is not a hero. He is an anti-hero. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some famous anti-heros: Michael Corleone (Godfather), Walter White (Breaking Bad), Travis Bickle (Taxi Driver). 

These characters would never have been possible if the writers/directors thought about morality, social responsibilty of the protagonists in a movie. If Walter White (the drug kingpin from Breaking Bad) was supposed to give a good message to the audience, Breaking Bad would've been the shittiest show in history.

"What is the Indian govt strategy to end Coronavirus? I have been reading about it for so many days, but still so confused.

Questions:

\#1: A) Are they trying to cure all infected people of Coronavirus so there is no more ill person or B) they are trying to infect everyone at a slow rate so that no more person is left to infect?

\#2: If the answer to #1 is ""A"", is it even possible, considering it's increasing day by day?

\#3: If the answer to #1 is ""B"", why we introduced lockdown so soon. I think it would have made more sense to introduce lockdown when there were at least 25K patients all over India. Now we have to wait for more time to reach the peak, which means more days of lockdown.

\#4: If the answer is not either ""A"" or ""B"",  then C) what is our current strategy? D) How it will end the Coronavirus? E) Does it require same level of lockdown throughout the country?

\#5: Bonus Question: How are people still getting infected if everyone is locked at home?",Coronavirus

"A neophyte analysis between Russian Chernobyl and Indian Bhopal disasters: TIL a chemical leak from a pesticide plant in India killed and injured more people than Chernobyl In the intervening night of 02 - 03.12.1984, around 40 tons of methyl isocyanate gas (MIC) accidentally leaked into the air from a pesticide plant managed by Union Carbide Corporation (now owned by Dow Chemicals), engulfing surrounding slum areas and suffocating tens and thousands. “Children, women, old men dying and dead on the roads. Carcasses of dogs, cats, chickens, goats, buffaloes, cows, birds lay everywhere,” read a New York Times article published a week after the incident.

**The direct cause of the Bhopal gas leak is attributed to the presence of water in a tank containing liquid methyl isocyanate (MIC)**. Liquid MIC is a chemical intermediate meant for the production of pesticide Sevin. Now, this chemical is stored in underground tanks under cool temperature and optimum pressure. Large amount of water enters tank no.610 on the night of December 2, 1984. This tank contained atleast 40 tonnes of MIC, more than the safety rules permitted. A run-away reaction begins which is speeded up by contaminants (iron residues from corroding pipelines). The mixing generates major increase in temp/pressure forcing the venting of toxic fumes.

Like Chernobyl, the Bhopal disaster was a man-made nightmare, with scientific &amp; investigative reports pointing to negligence, government oversight, managerial defects and state-level maladministration.

**Chernobyl/Bhopal**
Neither did scientists and Soviet leaders at Chernobyl nor did Indian authorities and officials of the multinational corporation anticipate such levels of catastrophe. The worst thing, though, in both the cases, was the risk management. Poor crisis response aggravated the situation and inflicted damages that could have been averted or at least mitigated.

**Parallels between Chernobyl and Bhopal**

Both occurred in the 1980s with an eighteen-month gap between them.

Both accidents unfolded at mid-night during night-shift sessions.

Although both resulted in explosions (A nuclear reactor detonates in Europe while in South Asia, a large storage tank of chemicals blew out of its concrete chamber following an uncontrolled reaction with water), Chernobyl’s ‘immediate’ death toll was lower compared to Bhopal where thousands perished.

The two tragedies were blamed on ‘operator error’ and led to the arrest and prosecution of individuals.

The Chernobyl Atomic Energy Station and the Union Carbide India Limited (UCIL) pesticide plant were constructed in relatively backward regions. Soviet Ukraine was a largely agrarian economy. **Madhya Pradesh was one of the least developed areas in India at the time. The state launched incentive schemes to attract factories and companies. Rapid industrialization invited large group of people, workers and migrants looking for jobs; many settled close to the factory. **During 1983-1984, the local government approved sanctions to let residents stay in these localities.

HOT (Human, Organisational and Technological) analysis reveals that administrative and managerial weaknesses contributed significantly to both accidents. In the case of Chernobyl, experiments similar to the routine maintenance test which led to the nuclear meltdown had been carried out before. The technical factors that caused the toxic leak at Bhopal had been identified previously but never fixed. In 1981, three years before the debacle, seepage of phosgene gas (component of methyl isocyanate) killed one of three employees assigned to shut it down. It was understood the person took off his gas mask in a contaminated area. At least 4 more leaks were recorded until 1982. **Safety lapses and minor mishaps were common occurrences at the Union Carbide factory.**

Workers broke safety rules because of organisational pressures. The need to generate electricity and meet the demands at Chernobyl pushed employees to skip regulations. Commercial pressure dictated events at Bhopal as the company cut back on safety provisions and maintenance practices as profit margins plunged.

Fundamental design flaws existed in both the plants, such as the ‘jumper line’ in the pipework at Bhopal that led to the entry of water to the MIC storage tank, and the positive void coefficient at Chernobyl RBMK reactors which led to a positive power coefficient (sudden power surge) at low power outputs. 

Operators had access, and were allowed, to disable key safety equipment, contributing to the accidents. While there was considerable component failure at Bhopal (the failure of the pressure valve of tank no.610), there was no apparent component failure at all at Chernobyl. Around 26 November 1984 (a week before the catastrophe), a Union Carbide employee tried to move 42 tonnes of liquid MIC from one of the three storage tanks to the processing unit. Though nitrogen was sent in to enable the transfer, tank no. 610 failed to get pressurized. This was a sign of leak.

Both accidents were exacerbated by managerial failure, information dearth and system related errors. The refrigeration unit meant to keep liquid MIC cool under 10-15°C was **shut down**. The vent gas scrubber, installed to neutralise the poisonous gas in case of a leak, was put in **passive mode**. A pipe leading to the flare tower, capable of burning remaining gases going from the vent gas scrubber, was **disconnected.** The alarm siren was **switched off** immediately after starting it and only restarted once the leak became severe.

Poor perception of severity of risk compounded workers’ problems. In 1985, one year after the incident, many of the workers were interviewed. According to a Times report, almost all the workers said they knew methyl isocyanate (MIC) was dangerous and some said they knew it could be fatal, but a dozen workers said they underestimated its toxicity. No one said they knew it could kill many people quickly.

Both accidents resulted in extreme, life-threatening health problems. Victims of Chernobyl suffered from nuclear exposure of varying degree from mild maladies to ionising radiation. The effects on Bhopal gas victims were far-reaching and some, still unfolding - **blindness, cancer, birth defects, depleting fertility rates, respiratory disorders, intellectual disability, body deformities, environmental contaminants like lead, mercury in breast milk of nursing women, babies born with fused bones and holes in heart.** One survivor is quoted as saying, “Those who escaped with their lives are the unlucky ones – the lucky ones are those who died on that night.” 

The Bhopal factory lacked quality instrumentation. (The pressure indicator control and level indicator of the MIC tank and the temperature indicator alarm were faulty for a long time. The instructions in English were not comprehensible for the operators. The initial practice of employing degree holders and imparting 6-month training slowly caved-in. Some among the workers were high school graduates). The Chernobyl station, by contrast, was considered a fine specimen of the Soviet system’s flagship technology. The employees, who were highly-trained and well-paid by the country’s standards, felt confident that no major accident was possible and thus, did not hesitate to ignore instructions.

**The 1984 poisonous gas leak in central India, to this date, remains the world’s deadliest industrial disaster.** 3,787 deaths were confirmed by the state of Madhya Pradesh. In 2010, in a curative petition filed in the Supreme Court, the central government sought compensation for ‘5,295 deaths’. However, activists claim 25,000 people died so far as a direct result of the disaster and the continuous chemical trial left behind.

We will never know the true extent of Chernobyl’s damage and death toll. It's been 33 years and yet, the exact scale of human sacrifice and the number of displaced remains a secret and a much-debated topic. Around 600,000 liquidators (many among them affected) from around the Soviet Union were sent in to assist with the prolonged containment procedures. Between 1986 and 2000, a total of 350,000 people were displaced with the exponential extension of the exclusion zone. It is said that deaths range anywhere between 4,000 to 93,000 over the years. A Belarusian study estimates total cancer deaths at 115,000, in contrast to the World Health Organisation’s tally of 9,000. **The Soviet Union’s official death toll is listed as 31.**

"What are photography laws in India for public places? I just got into an argument with my friends who were under the impression that it is illegal to take photographs of a person without their permission even in a public place. I was dazed by their belief and their view of morality regarding that. Shortly after they withdrew from the conversation, refusing to talk further and leaving me frustrated.

 I could find only a little information concerning the matter on internet. And I have a lot of questions now. There doesn't seem to be any unified concrete law for photography. If there is one please let me know. 

An important article I found [here](http://blog.sujitshetty.com/2009/04/photographers-rights-in-india.html) has this information
>Passengers are now also permitted to take photographs from inside an aircraft while in flight or landing/take off at civil aerodromes. 

Which reminds me of the [arrest of 3 for taking picture of air hostesses](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/hindu-mahasabha-functionary-among-3-arrested-for-taking-pictures-of-air-hostesses-in-indigo-flight/)

Now I am not saying whether it was morally justified to take her photos when she clearly objected, but I am questioning whether it is illegal. So if I go to a public park and take a photo of a woman, does she have the power to put me into jail if I don't delete the photos on her request?

In the aforementioned case, the persons were charged under *IPC Section 354*(assault or criminal force to **woman** with intent to outrage her modesty) and under the *Sexual Harassment of* ***Women*** *at Workplace* (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act. 

This brings me to another question, is taking pictures of a woman without consent an act of sexual harassment? And what would have been the charges if the flight attendant was a man instead of a woman?

#####Precautions for prevention of Corona Virus
^Currently ^there ^is ^no ^vaccine ^available ^to ^protect ^against ^human ^corona ^virus ^but ^we ^can ^reduce ^the ^transmission ^of ^virus ^by ^taking ^following ^precautions:

1. Wash your hands frequently
2. Practice respiratory hygiene. Cover mouth and nose with a medical mask, tissue, or flexed elbow when coughing or sneezing. Wash hands afterwards and discard mask or tissue.
3. Maintain social distancing
4. Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth
5. If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical care early. Consult a doctor.
6. As a general precaution, practice general hygiene measures when visiting live animal markets, wet markets or animal product markets
7. Avoid consumption of raw or undercooked animal products
8. If you become sick while travelling, inform crew, seek medical attention early and share travel history.

#####How to Quarantine Yourself via [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/health/self-quarantine-coronavirus.html)
^If ^you’re ^returning ^from ^an ^area ^that’s ^had ^a ^coronavirus ^outbreak, ^or ^if ^you’ve ^been ^in ^close ^contact ^with ^someone ^who ^tests ^positive, ^you ^may ^be ^asked ^to ^isolate ^yourself ^at ^home ^for ^two ^weeks, ^the ^presumed ^incubation ^period ^for ^the ^coronavirus.

^It’s ^not ^easy ^to ^lock ^yourself ^away ^from ^your ^family ^and ^friends. ^These ^are ^the ^basics.

1. **ISOLATION**: If you are infected or have been exposed to the coronavirus, you must seclude yourself from your partner, your housemates, your children, your older aunt and even your pets. If you don’t have your own room, one should be designated for your exclusive use. No visitors unless it’s absolutely essential. Don’t take the bus, subway or even a taxi.

2. **MASKS**: If you must be around other people — in your home, or in a car, because you’re on your way to see a doctor (and only after you’ve called first) — wear a mask. Everyone else should, too.

3. **HYGIENE**: Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue to cough or sneeze, and discard it in a lined trash can. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. You can use sanitizer, but soap and water are preferred. Wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, if you haven’t just washed them.

4. **DISINFECTING**: Don’t share dishes, drinking glasses, eating utensils, towels or bedding. Wash these items after you use them. Use a household cleaner to wipe down countertops, tabletops, doorknobs, bathrooms fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets and bedside tables. That also goes for any surfaces that may be contaminated by bodily fluids.

5. **HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS**: When around the patient, wear a face mask, and add gloves if you’re touching anything that might carry the patient’s bodily fluids. Dispose of the mask and gloves immediately. The older members and those with chronic medical conditions should minimize contact with the secluded individual.

It's truly mind-blowing what OP has suggested.

Basically, this model has been there since 19th century and it was used to discipline kids and make them obedience.There has been no change ever since.Even though literacy rates of the west are higher,the quality of education has made many students drop out because it doesn't promote any creativity or critical thinking.The side effects of this are depression,ADHD and living unproductive life,of course.

What do you think of the solution they suggested?Do you want to add something to solution?

Ever since BJP has come to power, there has been systemic destruction of the nation's education system.  
Apart from few fancy Pradan Mantri Yojana's I honestly don't think BJP has done anything to improve the education system of the country. The latest attack of masked goons in JNU shows the condition of the Indian education system.   
Moreover, top BJP leader's have continuously attacked science and made unscientific statements in public trying to undermine rationality and scientific thinking.

> The BJP-led central governmenthas aggressively pursued the policies of commercialisation, centralisation and communalisation of education. It is accelerating the neo-liberal educational policies of the previous UPA government, aimed at deregulating the education sector and increasing the avenues of profit maximisation for the private capital. However, at the same time it is destroying the federal character of Indian education and is attempting to control the entire sector from the Centre, as part of the designs to push the Hindutva agenda. This is reflected in appointing RSS personnel in key administrative bodies, rewriting of history, abrupt and irrational changes in syllabi, propagation of pseudoscience, so on and so forth. The brunt of these attacks is falling upon the students from the socio-economically exploited and oppressed section.

"Need silver linings? NPCI responds to our representation. It is investigating the Truecaller ""Breach"" &amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/r1u801m8uye31.png

On 30.07.2019, media reports and various user complaints brought to light an issue that caused the automatic registration of unified payments interface (UPI) based IDs of Truecaller users without their knowledge and consent. We wrote to NPCI indicating concern and suggesting immediate and intermediate action ([**read more**](https://internetfreedom.in/true-caller-or-false-caller-we-ask-ncpi-to-answer-this-question/)).

NPCI wrote back to us in less than 48 hours agreeing with the contents of our representation. It also indicated two specific steps. *First* it had stopped on boarding new Truecaller users on the UPI Platform. *Second* the matter is under investigation and we will be informed after diligence is completed in all matters. We will keep urging for public disclosure that will have multiple benefits. It will help inform impacted users, improve processes in technology companies and further greater trust in the UPI ecosystem.

But also, let us step back for a moment. This is not only about Truecaller. It is about user consent more widely. The privacy, safety and security of users of the UPI interface. While for a complete remedy we need a data protection law (*which India does not have yet*) that is user centric *(*[***like the Indian Privacy Code***](https://saveourprivacy.in/principles)); we appreciate and commend the actions being taken by NPCI within its mandate and urge it do more.

Limited to the UPI ecosystem, in our representation we made three specific suggestions on the basis of inputs and tweets from Srikanth Lakshmanan (@logic), Anand Venkatanarayanan ([**@iam\_anandv**](https://twitter.com/iam_anandv)), Srinivas Kodali ([**@digitaldutta**](https://twitter.com/digitaldutta)) and Abhay Rana ([**@captn3m0**](https://twitter.com/captn3m0)). We continue to urge the NPCI to walk towards them and are hopeful that our wide community of supporters encourage them to do so as well.

"Why the Tablighi jamaat has less to blame and the Indian state more to blame for the spurt in coronavirus cases due to the congregation than you think The event took place from March 13th to 16th. As of March 13th, there was no information about coronavirus cases being detected from the congregration that took place earlier in Malaysia's Selangor. 

(Source: Google search for ""tablighi+jamaat+coronavirus"" for articles that appeared before March 13th [[link](https://www.google.com/search?q=coronavirus+tablighi+jamaat&tbs=cdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3A%2Ccd_max%3A3%2F16%2F2020)])

It was only by March 16th that information about the cases in Malaysia started pouring in and it was on March 16th that Delhi announced a ban on religious congregations. But by this time, these 3000 odd people had already been assembled in Delhi and come in contact with the international attendees, who presumably had brought the coronavirus. So, it was not criminal negligence or stupidity that made these people have this congregation but, simply, lack of information.

Which now brings me to the second point I want to make. After March 16th, the primary response of Indian state was to enforce the Delhi government's order by getting this congregation to dissipate, which given the information coming from Malaysia was absolutely the incorrect call. All of these people should have been tested for coronavirus and quarantined immediately. Instead, they were forced to return to wherever they came from and two weeks later we are spending our efforts tracing the tracks of all the people who had attended the congregation and all the tens of thousands of people they may have come in contact with during all this time after they left. The bureaucratic inertia of the Indian state took a relatively localized problem and made it much, much worse than it needed to be.",Coronavirus

"Economic Shit Storm Incoming brace for impact : What failure of corporate tax rate may imply. Before getting bombarded, let me say that it is what if scenario which is rather pessimistic but a possibility nonetheless, and I vehemently believe that we are facing growth recession if not outright recession as of now. 

1) Lack of new job creation, decrease in purchasing power, negligible increase in either headline inflation or core inflation, 2-3% gdp growth rate, if we calculate gdp using previous base year, has substantiated that we are or are heading to recession. Recession doesn't always mean negative gdp growth rate. 

2) Uncertain and draconian policy : Fast changing policies which have proved to be bereft of commitment by actual spending and pervading religious divide and ideology is eating away a part of budget.

3) Infrastructure projects underway, but for whome? Bullet train, statues and home creation, but none of them are infrastructure investment which will help economy at scale and will come out to bite few years later.

4) Migrating tendency : Large mobilisation by semi-elite and educated group due to ease of getting residential cards given that you are competent. It should increase by substantial amount after global economy slow down is over and again will bite back later due to the fact that with lack of skilled man power fewer companies will invest


Deflation & Lack of buffer and misguided policies

5) Corporation tax cut : Current situation is because of lack of purchasing power even among those who are employed and even a cursory glance at past will tell that India has never seen tickle down Impact so I don't expect increase in PP 1) It will fail to attract new investment 2) Goods may get cheaper which will lead to deflation.

6) Possible Deflation : With lack of buffer and policy failure, we will spiral down to deflation and products will get cheaper but people will start losing jobs at hitherto rate.

New minted currency as catalyst to breaking economic cycle and perhaps for even worse 

7) Bottleneck Inflation leading to stagflation : Demand will stay the same or may even increase while infrastructure will be severely lacking and to boost economy, we may see new minted currencies and it will lead to rising prices(inflation) but job loss will still stay the same 

8) Lack of foreign investment : Above should be enough to deter any large FDI flow.

"[Scheduled]The population debate: The depopulation phase of India and it's impact of the economy Here's a question:
We know through stats that around 2050-60, the population the country will fall down, and with an estimated 2-digit trillion economy, we will see the rise of the GDP per capita.

This is all WITH the current TFR (It is at a replacement rate). Now we change some data shall we? The goverment decides that from tomorrow, would apply mandatory childless policies. It's illegal to procreate and people would need to adopt children if they want to be, you know, parents. Amazing! Orphans would get new homes and they are really happy (Let us assume, they law is perfectly enforced).

The TFR would fall down below the replacement rate, ensuring population WILL fall down. However, there's this problem: We have a lot old people, and the thing is *they can't work*. Especially a country like India, where there is huge population and on top of that: *a huge old population*. How are we going to give them pensions? Government would *spend* more than *gain* more? An old poor population isn't a very good incentive for FDI either. How are we going to tackle the massive grey population we have?

"To everyone so loudly celebrating today, ask yourselves a few basic questions. 1. What strange idea of a unified nation are you celebrating when the decisions (some of which are yet to be formalized into effect) to alter an entire state's present and future were taken without its citizens' consent or even knowledge, amid a total blackout of communication services and lockdown on personal movement, so that the state's own people had no idea (and many might still not) what was going on until after the rest of the world? If this ever happens to you, I'd like to know how celebratory you feel.

2. What bold move are you celebrating when the only way this could have been done was in total secrecy and by silencing any voice of dissent from the state, by placing leaders under arbitrary house arrest? What courage does it take to silence and subjugate everyone and then make your move unimpeded?   

3. What historic step are you celebrating – the one that has set such a dangerous precedent for Constitutional principles and democracy, the one that has trampled all over human rights?

4. What is this #KashmirHamaraHai that you are shouting about? Is Kashmir just a piece of land to you, one to be annexed and forced into submission by trickery and without the consent or knowledge of the people who actually live on that land? Are you honestly just so excited about buying that retirement home in Sonamarg or Pahalgam that you've forgotten basic humanity?

5. What development opportunities are you so looking forward to – the arbitrary use of UAPA to arrest any protestor on charges of terrorism?

6. What firm message against terrorism are you celebrating - do you not see that this is smoke and mirrors to distract from the fact that the economy is doing so poorly?

7. Even if you genuinely believe that 370 and 35A need to go and that bifurcation is somehow going to be useful, is there any need to be so ridiculously insensitive to the absolute fear and panic within which all of this is unfolding, the fact that people have been unable to speak with their parents, unable to find out if they are even alive? You might argue the end justifies the means – that is, if you're even thinking about the means at all. But the next time something like this happens – and make no mistake, there will be a next time, and it won't always be in far-flung Assam or Kashmir that don't directly affect you or your family – think about how you reacted today.

Between Teen Talak, Chandrayan, nationwide floods, Article 370 and Economic crash most of you must not have noticed the National Medical Commission Bill (NMC) that was sneaked into the parliament and passed in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha recently. This bill that shakes the healthcare system of the country to the core (and not in a good way) was vehemently opposed by doctors all over India, by black bands, marches, burning copies of the bill and when all else failed, even strikes. Many even got arrested during the protests. Yet, it never even made it to the National news. And the bill passed with barely any opposition. So what is it, why doctors are protesting it and is it really that bad?

Let me save you a lot of time - YES! But that is my opinion. Please feel free to form your own opinion. I am attaching a copy of the bill so you can read it yourself if you want,

 [http://164.100.47.4/BillsTexts/LSBillTexts/Asintroduced/185\_2019\_LS\_Eng.pdf](http://164.100.47.4/BillsTexts/LSBillTexts/Asintroduced/185_2019_LS_Eng.pdf) 

Here are some of the points in the bill that I found very disturbing. 

# Legalization of quackery : 

First please understand that under the current system, students after clearing +2 medical undergo MBBS entrance exams through NEET. After clearing one of the most rigorous competitive exams in existence, they study under gruelling circumstances (in govt colleges and a handful of private colleges) for 4.5 years. The exams every year and after passing Final year MBBS, they have to do one more year of very hard training (internship). After that, they have to pass yet another exam called the NEET PG entrance exam to gain admission for MD/MS courses to become a specialist. Since the value of MBBS has greatly decreased, this has become a mainstream process for ost doctors across the country before practicing.

Also note that India has a massive shortage of doctors. According to **WHO, the doctor patient** ratio needs to be **1:1000.** Note that WHO specifies this for government Allopathic doctors. In India this ratio of government allopathic doctors is **1:10,189**. Which means that there is a massive **shortage** of doctors - amost **6 lakh** doctors in the country. This shortage is found in **both urban and rural areas** though the shortage in r**ural areas is more severe.** However, the urban areas are not doing that good either. This is especially when the entire rural population is also seeking healthcare in the urban areas due to **lack of basic facilities and infrastructure** in the rural areas. These deficiencies would not allow for much healthcare provision even if doctors were there.

Also, note that according to WHO standards, India **lacks 2 million nurses** as well. WHO has issued warnings to India regarding its dire state of healthcare and the crisis faced by the people. So the ""brilliant"" (massive sarcasm) solution is this NMC bill was Community Healthcare Providers. We already have a similar system of ANM's that kind of fit the description, so why is this a problem.

The problem lies in the **language of the bill** which is **very vague**.  It states that ""Any person connected to the allopathic heathcare system"" can provide ""primary and preventive healthcare"" ""for a limited period of time""  after a ""6 month training program"". They can work without supervision here. However, under secondary and tertiary hospitals, they will have to work under doctor's suprvision.

Look at the statements in quotes. What does **""any person connected to allopathic healthcare""** mean? Can an ambulance driver get this accredition? Can a ward boy get it? The bill makes no specification. It does not specify the minimum qualification needed for the course. (I could be wrong but I did not find any description). It does not state any experience required or previous job status - nothing.

next it talks about a **6-month training** program. Again, training for what? What courses will be included, What these people will be trained in. How they will be trained. Nothing is specified.

Next it talks about providing **primary healthcare**. From what I understand. Primary healthcare means the treatment one gets at the first point of contact with the healthcare system. Generally, In sane countries where stuff like people's health is important, this means a contact with GP - a general practitioner or physician that can provide basic treatment for basic things. But In a country like India where ""Superpeciality Hospitals"" are the first point of contact for people, the lines between primary and tertiary level healthcare are blurred. **The bill does not define what Primary and Preventive medicine mean**. It is not understood or implied because as I said, anything can be considered primary when given at first point of contact with healthcare. So what treatment can the Community healthcare providers provide? Can they write cardio medications? Can they write pediatric medications? Note that even MBBS students cannot write super specialty treatments or even a head CT to look for brain problems unless under supervision. Even PG students (3 more years after MBBS and internship which makes them a specialist) cannot fiddle with other departments' treatment. And for good reason - the medication and treatment is way more complicated than making a Chandrayan rocket. SO can these people write that? Can they perform operations, which MBBS students cannot do unsupervised? Even PG and beyond need supervision. 

Doctors are strictly regulated when it comes to ultrasound to prevent sex determination and female feticides. (I am not trying to open a debate about whether that is good or bad. Doctors, please focus on the issue at hand) What is the guarantee that these people will not just determine the sex? 

Again, these people are supposed to be practicing in rural areas. There is **no mechanism to make sure** that they will actually **practice in rural areas** and not just peddle pills in urban areas. 

Also, while doctors are bound to write generics and single-dose combinations, there are **zero regulations** in place for these Community Healthcare providers. (CHP) How is this in line with the intention to decrease unregulated indiscriminate use of drugs?

Also, how much time is ""limited period of time""? 3 months, 1 year, 10 years. 100 years? Nothing is specified. Even doctors have to renew their registration every 3 years.

Already people illegally practice allopathy and kill so many people and give them lifelong problems. The govt has claimed to ""stop all quackery"" with this bill. Well yeah, this is one way of doing it. Legalize quackery so there won't be any quacks left. Note that the reports of how well these CHP's do are mostly self-reported and up to now have been for things like uncomplicated delivery and diarrhea. If you talk to doctors they will tell you that in uncomplicated deliveries (which form a large chunk of the deliveries) you have to just catch the baby. The baby and the mother do all the hard work for you. In many cases of bleeding, a simple massage can help stop it. So that is not a very complicated thing to be entrusting to the community. However, comparing that to all primary healthcare is very wrong.

Now, note that doctors are **not opposed** to the idea of community health practitioners **in principle**. Like I said ANM's already exist. However, how the system is set up and managed is the issue. Something more sensible would be welcome. For example. 6-month training program for a nurse with more than 7 years work experience in an MCI approved medical college/hospital specifically to help prevent Acute Encephalitis Syndrome and provide aftercare once the kid has been discharged from the medical college. The appointment should be for 3 years pending renewal and the power to practise should be void outside the specified areas. Add to that some basic management like ORS for diarrhoea, basic hygiene education, women's health education, checking BP, temperature or changing dressings etc (which nurses already do in most hospitals). However, management should be according to doctor's prescription and on any changes immediate referral and contact with the doctor. I don't think many doctors would be opposed to that form of a system. However, this vague wildfire like scenario is extremely scary.

Regarding **no** **supervision** \- why would anyone want to work under supervision when they can work unregulated alone? This will take away nurses etc from the hospitals. As I already mentioned that there is a massive shortage of them, the conditions in hospitals will become even worse as more and more of the nurses (and other professionals or non-professionals) set out to practice legalized quackery. This system should be started after ensuring an increase in the existing personnel, not just redirecting them.

If you want **more rural practitioners**, research has shown that the best way is to **make the system more inclusive** of people born and brought up in rural areas. The medical profession in India is barely in the reach of urban lower middle-class families. Rural population cal only dream of becoming doctors, here in such an exclusive system. But more on that later.

Also, for the people who cite **WHO recommendation for CHP**? - Note that WHO stated this for **very poor countries** that cannot train doctors due to complete lack of funds or war etc. They also stated that this is **highly dependent on the kind of training** received by the workers and care should be taken to ensure proper training for the work. Many countries much much poorer than India have managed a much better healthcare system without the use of these things. In India ( the 7th largest economy set to be a ""5 trillion dollar economy"" (ahem, ahem), what sense does it make to adopt measures for very poor and war-torn countries when we can afford better systems. 

The only sense I can make of it is that it will allow the govt to artificially inflate the numbers on the paper and say that they doubled or trebled the number of ""allopathic"" healthcare providers without having lift a finger. The situation on the ground will not change and might even become worse.

&amp;#x200B;

# 2. The Bridge Course 

The notorious bridge course is back. This allows AYUSH practitioners to practice allopathy after a 6-month ""bridge course"". This is also ridiculous. Note that Ayurveda, Unani, Siddhi and Homeopathy are very different from allopathy. 6 months is not sufficient to learn the materials MBBS doctors find it hard to grasp in 5-8 years. It is hard and a lot of clinical time is required to gain the skills (yes even the meager skills of the doctors these days). That cannot happen in 6 months. This would be like asking a history PhD to build a nuclear reactor. History professor may have a PhD but it is not in physics. similarly, AYUSH is not the same as allopathy. Just as I would not want allopathy people practicing AYUSH. Now, I am not saying Ayurveda is not helpful or good. It is and should be allowed to flourish and thrive (don't get me started on homeopathy. I feel and this is my personal opinion, it is absolute garbage. But to each their own). However, I do believe that these practices should be kept separate and should not be allowed to mix.

AYUSH practitioners practicing allopathy, performing unauthorized surgeries and even running ICU's is a big reason for the poor healthcare, especially critical healthcare in the country.

While we should be investing in training Trauma surgeons, intensivists for better emergency management and taking of the massive work burden off of the specialists so they can focus on OPD's we are legalizing quackery. Training paramedics and issuing proper well-equipped ambulances would be a much better use of resources, help massively in cutting down the number of deaths and even stimulate the automobile industry. But no. 

If we really wanted to eliminate quackery, we would have one national database for registration of doctors. The doctor's name, place of work and registration number would be available for people to see. Anyone could type that in and check whether the doctor is an actual licensd practitioner or not. Would not be that hard. 

However, as was said in the Parliamentary discussion "" **The content of the bill is directly opposed to the stated intent of the bill"".**

# 3. The Very Misunderstood NEXT exam.

A lot of people think that NEXT exam is a good thing and will improve the clinical skills of doctors because that is what the Anti-Health Minister Harshvardhan Sinha stated. However, this is a pure recipe to **destroy all clinical skills** in medicine for good

Understad that currently every single yearly exam for MBBS (1st prof, 2nd prof, 3rd prof and 4th prof) is conducted by the university. The exams consist of theory regarding mostly the most common diseases found, practicals and clinical case discussion. Note that the object of the exam is to reject people unworthy of practicing medicine (I am obviously not including the donation and capitation seats and the completely useless medical colleges)

On the other hand, NEET PG entrance asks about questions that have very less clinical value and often about stuff that is rare and theoretical. The object is to rank students and select a handful out of thousands for future courses. Success is largely dependent on one's ability to take coaching and capacity to memorize MCQ's.

NEXT proposes to merge the two. These two exams are polar opposites of each other. One cannot satisfy both criteria. 

Now, if one says that NEXT will have clinical exams. Then that poses a massive problem for PG entrance. First, it is **nearly impossible to conduct clinical exams** at such a massive scale at the same time. Next, **clinical exams are subjective.** This subjectivity poses massive problems for **PG competition entrance** which should be objective, especially when there can be as many as 200 candidates at the difference of a fraction of a mark in the exam. Note that practical examiners are prone to **biases** and generally being one of the minorities, women, people from lower socioeconomic status, religion or someone not liking your face can cause you to fail because of their **discrimination**. Universities tend to protect agaist this to some degree. However, without any university to intervene, **scandals** in exams will become even more rampant than NEET. 

Note that this exam will be necessary to gain your degree. If an **MBBS student fails** this exam, they will be **equivalent to +2**. The bill makes no mention of how many attempts candidates get for this exam. By the looks of it, students can take this only once. Chances of failing are very high the first time especially when the exam is designed to reject the majority of the people. This will **destroy the careers of students for good**. This is devastating when you consider the amount of time and money spent by students for MBBS. Many students have taken **loans**. This makes no sense when **the difficulty of the exam has nothing to do with what actually it takes to become a good doctor.** Meanwhile, nurses, ward boys and AYush are having a gala time. Note the level of difficulty for MBBS doctors who actually study the required subjects and the ease with which non-MBBS people will have in order to practice the same management.

On the other hand, **if** one says that there will be **no clinical exam**, then this will **decimate the clinical skills of doctors completely**. Already MBBS students are found more in the coaching classes than with patients. Why would anyone go to clinics?

Moreover, note that the **final year MBBS has 6-7 subjects**. While **PG entrance has 19 subjects**. If one says that only final year MBBS subjects will come in the exam, then how does one justify admission into non-final year subjects (MBBS teaches stuff like microbiology in 2nd year. However, PG is gained in microbiology only after clearing PG entrance.) Also, an overall knowledge of all subjects is required to become a good doctor, Preclinical knowledge (non final year subjects) is as important as clinical. This was precisely why just 2 years ago the govt proposed ro make it compulsory to pass (gain at least 50 percentile) in the NEET PG entrance exam to even practice as an MBBS doctor. That kind of a reform would make more sense. ( I am not here to  debate how NEET is not Clean, focus doctors, focus). To take admission in an engineering college one must have studied maths in +2. One does not get admission based on class 9th marks of maths while they have studied History and arts in +2.  Then why is PG entrance allowing for this?

On the other hand, final year degree examination (similar to 10th exam or passing +2 which can be done in any subject) comprises of only final year subjects. So if one follows the PG entrance pattern, how does one justify making someone study ALL the subjects?

The cherry on the cake is that all this has been done **without standardizing the medical syllabus.** So different universities have variations in what they teach. This is what allows some universities to be awesome, like AIIMS and PGI or even the whole state of Tamil Nadu's awesome colleges. But it also allows some colleges to be absolute garbage. However, since the universities have their own exams, the students have to qualify them based on what they learned. If one wants to conduct one exam, it is imperative that the syllabus and the books be standardized. Else it will not be fair. It would be like studying the table of 2 and being asked about the constitution of India. It makes no sense. We have already seen how badly NEET has affected TN and its medical education system. That will be the story for the whole country

[Edit: Moreover, it seems like it eliminates internship. Understand that Medical students need to pass 4th prof to do internship. They do internship and then take NEET as an Exit test to qualify and practice. Internship is the most important thing in the entire career of a doctor to gain clinical skills and get an all-round knowledge of healthcare. That is one year in between the final year and the NEET entrance. However, the bill has combined those two exams one year apart into one and nothing has been mentioned in the bill as to what will happen to the internship.] 

This will promote **coaching culture.** Coaching is the **termite** that has hollowed out the medical system in India. IMO, this poison should be exterminated for good. However, this bill gives it more power. Already if one has not taken coaching in a metropolitan or sub metropolitan city, cannot afford coaching or is rejected by coaching institutes or cannot access them, they have **very low chances** of getting into MBBS or PG entrance (unless you ave backchannels through dalals. But most of them work through coaching institutes anyway). Now, these students **will not even be able to gain a degree**. They will not be able to practice even as MBBS doctors. All the while, CHP can practice medicine after a 6-month course! If your intent is to increase the doctor-patient ratio, how does this make any sense?

# 4. Reservation for the rich

ote that Medical colleges, both for MBBS and PG, have ""regulated and unregulated seats"". Regulated seats are where the fees is regulated by the government. They are affordable for even lower middle income groups. The unregulated seats charge amounts that only the very rich can afford, (no, even upper middle class cannot usually afford it) The Anti health minister claimed that the NMC bill will regulate 50% seats. Sounds great. But it isn't. When you look at the current system, the central government and the state governments together regulate 75-85% of the seats. This is a net **drop from 85% to 50% in the affordable regulated seats.** The increase in unregulated seats has been called reservation for the rich as **universities decrease the minimum marks required for admission to accommodate students that pay more at the expense of more deserving candidates.** Medical education is slowly becoming less and less accessible to the common man. Note that the **less the access of medical education to the common man, the less is the access of healthcare to the common man.**

This is obviously to put more money in the pockets of the politicians and their cronies that own so many medical colleges across the country.

# 5. National Medical Omission Bill

Note that until now, there is a **set method** of maintaining **medical colleges**. There are **strict requirements** to open a medical college, maintain one (keep one open), to increase the available seats for students, etc. It makes sense because medical colleges **treat people and train future doctors**. It is imperative they have proper requirements to do so. For eg, one cannot become a surgeon is there is not an operation theatre (or enough tables in the operating theatre for students to learn on). Until now, this regulation was done by the MCI or the medical council of India.

Yes, the same one. However, recently MCU has been **closing down many medical colleges** across the country , even government colleges, as **the government has not provided appropriate funds to maintain the infrastructure.** I am not even going to start with private medical colleges (not talking about the few awesome ones) While the govt likes to brag about ""creation"" of new seats in medical colleges, they conveniently forget the seats lost due to lack of upkeep of existing medical colleges. Just **last year** about 2000 seats were created and about 3000 seats were lost. There was a **net loss of about 1000 medical seats.** But instead of spending money on the colleges, the govt decided to eliminate the body that shut down incompetent medical colleges. 

Now the colleges **do not need to be inspected. Inspection is optional and can be done after 4 years of the opening of medical college** \- at the time the first medical batch passes. What is to stop you or me from opening a **Trump University** like medical college, charge lakhs of rupees per student per year and then close the college after 3 years and then open another one? Absolutely nothing. This will destroy the careers of thousands of students per year. This will destroy their homes and lives (remember how much money these colleges will charge). Students will pay the fees, join coaching, and study and due to no fault of them, they will be left with no degree. Just like with generics, for medical colleges, there will be **no pragmatic way to tell reliable and unreliable ones apart** (except for a few ones). This is l**egalized conmaship. (420si)** Not to mention the money laundering hubs these paces will become.

Note that the old MCI head was in trouble for taking money to allow some sub-par medical colleges to function. So the solution is to remove ALL regulation from ALL medical colleges. What a cognitive dissonance sir jee.

This truly is the National Medical Omission Bill.

# 6. No more AIIMS, PGI?

Well,techncally they will still exist. You must know that AIIMS, PGI, JIPMER like institutes enjoy a **fairly autonomous status** and the **government** is **not able to interfere** in their working by and large. Correct me if I am wrong, but NMC bill **removes this autonomous status.** This autonomous status plays a great part in making these colleges hubs of learning and research, incredible studies and **institutes of excellence.** This will be a massive blow to their functioning and will reflect in the quality of their care and research. I have no explanation as to why the govt would want to do this.

Another point is that these institutes have PG exams twice a year. However, under NEXT, that will be reduced to once a year. This will cause droppers to lose an entire year instead of months. 

# 7. Replacing MCI with worse.

So we have all heard about the corruption stories of MCI. No one is defending the MCI here. However, this bill does away with the MCI and replaces it with the national Medical commission. This will consist of all government appointees so they will be pretty much like Niti Ayog. What is amazing is that the **medical community gets nearly no representation** in the NMC. Ask yourselves about how much you know about the medical system and how it works (non-medicos obviously). That is exactly how much these people will know. And they are supposed to make decisions about medical education and healthcare. Imagine handing plutonium to a monkey. That would be safer.

Now, there has been many proposals to fix the MCI problem. I liked the one where MCI would be elected and the members would be on partial terms like Rajya Sabha. Their functions would be the same as the old MCI. To control the corruption, one could have ahd oversight by a National Health Comittee with represenation of govt and medical communty; Kind of how it works in Germany. This may not be the best solution but this is one of the scores of solution sthat were better than the NMC.

The state of economy that we see today will be the state of healthcare very soon because it will be managed by similar people.

&amp;#x200B;

# 8. Barely any State Representation

The NMC has a structure where states get rotational representattion. Which means a **state**, especially smaller stated that need more **representation** will get a chance to be on the committee **after as much as 12 years**! After slight dissent from the (non) opposition, this rotation was changed so that states could get representation a little sooner, However, even that is pretty vague. So obviouly state interests are not protected.

&amp;#x200B;

# 9. Too much power

The NMC has too much power. Even **MCI** inspected the colleges and provided guidelines over the medical syllabus, it **did not fix fees, decide new branches** unilaterally **or have complete control over exams**. NMC has all that and more. **The definition of the powers and purpose is so vague that it is meaningless.** They could do anything and it would be binding. 

Moreover,  **the decision of the center in all matters is final.**  so the center could issue a fatwah on anything in complete opposition of the opinion of the entire medical community, all the states, all professions involved (like this bill) and everyone will have to follow it no matter how senseless or harmful. This is total dictatorship and seeing the past few decisions regarding healthcare, will be devastating!

&amp;#x200B;

These are just some of the most important problems I saw at first glance. As I learn more about this. I will keep you posted. I thought everyone should know about these problems as each of these directly affects your healthcare. The politician will fly to USA at taxpayer money for their treatment. We will have to suffer the consequences. If you are outraged by this, please spread the word. Contact the media and ask them to cover this.

"[NP]Engineering Education In India: Hot Intake, Cold Results Under the new NDA government, there has been a rush to establish a glut of premier technical institutions. A proposal for six new IITs has been ratified, in addition to the nine new ones already established in 2008. The total number of candidates in the JEE (Mains) was 12.5 lakhs this year. The All India Council for Technical Education recognizes a whopping 6,378 institutions for undergraduate engineering study, with a humongous intake of 31.78 lakh. The All-India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE) report for the year 2013-14 pegs the proportion of undergraduate enrolment in engineering, technology and computer fields combined at 20.08%, second only to the combined field of Arts, Humanities and the Social Sciences.

However, does quantity mean quality? Does offering long-reaching career choices to students not old enough to vote or drink, and parents out of sync with the current market and research scenario fare well in the context of Indian higher education?

**Indicators of Concern**

*Employability*

The National Employability Report published by Aspiring Minds in 2015 presents worrying numbers that paint a sorry picture. It found a meagre 17.91% engineers employable in the software services sector, and an abysmal 3.67% in the software products sector. In non-IT roles, the statistics were as alarming, with only 6.5% and 5.55% engineers employable in design roles in electrical and mechanical engineering respectively. 

The report comments that most candidates lack basic programming and algorithmic knowledge, and in non-IT core roles, there is lack of a clear grasp of fundamentals, which is often the only thing required by recruiters. In fact, it says that 60% of engineers lag behind by not possessing specific domain knowledge. 

The go-to option for a burgeoning class of aspirers, engineering represents the “easy path”, and a focus on end results eclipses learning processes. Moreover, choices of specialization are made based on entrance examination ranks, before any taste of specialised curricula or actual field work in a particular subject. Such ill-informed decision-making is bound to generate an outpouring of reluctant engineers who are confused and ill-equipped in their respective areas. 

*Output*

The other important outcome of technical education is research and development. Contributing to advancing technology in terms of academic research and patents is an important development indicator, as R&D output has direct effects on economic prosperity and standard of living. 

The SCImago Journal & Country Rank rates publications and countries in terms of research output in different fields. Ranking countries by citations-per-document published, which indicates the average number of times a paper has been cited by other works, we find India ranked a middling 40th among 87 nations with at least 1000 engineering publications from 1996 to 2014. 

According to data collected by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) on selected indicators of innovation among labs and higher educational institutions in 2014, we find India comes 31st out of 48 ranked entities in terms of patents filed per GDP as a percentage (including a combined number for the EU, which comes above India). 

We see how India languishes in the middle in terms of both patents and it the citation counts of academic publications. What forces are afoot that drag India’s comparative performance into mediocrity despite the colossal undergraduate intake? Let’s crunch some numbers to get to the bottom of it.

**A Chain of Causes**

*Postgraduate Education*

Research output also measures the health of postgraduate and doctoral education in the countries, signalling the willingness of undergraduates to continue in the field of their choosing. A report published in 2013 by the South Asia Development Sector of the World Bank says that 94.56% of engineering students in India are undergraduates, with only 5.4% in Master’s programs, the lowest but for Brazil. 

At the same time, a 2014 report published by the Student Exchange and Visitor Program (SEVP) in the United States says that a huge majority (81%) of India-based graduate students are in STEM fields. 

This data points to a prevalent scenario in which limited information and social pressure compels undergraduates to pick engineering, but the higher education machinery fails to retain numbers at postgraduate levels, at least in India.  Students who can afford it fly abroad, especially to the US for search of better options in education and employment. 
The AISHE 2013-14 report also says that only 9% of its respondents who had enrolled in postgraduate courses went on to pursue a PhD in the field, which links us to the next issue. 

*Throttled Funds*

The dearth of doctoral students in engineering fields owes itself in no small part to inadequate compensation. Junior research fellows take home Rs. 25,000 per month, while senior PhD candidates get Rs. 28,000. Moreover, insufficient funds are allocated to science and engineering research, making the production of high quality matter more challenging. 
International Science and Engineering Indicators published by the National Science Foundation of the USA include the proportion of GDP expended on R&D, based on which India ranks 40th among 60 nations studied, with a lowly 0.81%
. 

*Teacher Numbers*

Above, we saw how small a percentage of students transition to postgraduate and doctoral studies in their fields, and by extension, the number of qualified teachers at college level falls down, denting the prospects of a proper education for subsequent generations of students, creating a vicious loop of negative feedback. 

Two other statistics and their comparisons in the above mentioned World Bank report signal a severe shortage of teaching resources in the engineering education arena.

Using general higher education statistics from MHRD reports in 2011, the report estimates the average faculty per institution at 19, and the student-to-faculty ratio at 24. The latter ratio depicts the even spreading of teaching resources, and a high value means lesser attention to every individual student’s learning objectives. To put the number into perspective, the AICTE recommends a ratio of 12 at undergraduate level, and 15 at graduate level. 

With better-paying avenues in regular jobs, most fresh graduates stay away from the lengthy and arduous path of academia and teaching.

**Conclusions**

The lack of postgraduates, doctoral researchers, and the best teachers prevents the blossoming of a rewarding academic atmosphere and thus makes departments accumulate reluctant and untrained teachers, by making them unattractive to the best talents.  This stunts exposure to good teaching and research for undergraduates, which in turn contributes to disillusionment, insufficient interest and technical knowledge, low employability rates, and a departure from technical fields of work and study post their first degree, feeding the crippling dearth of skills and results at higher levels.

**#Brexit Update**

This isn’t the first time that a Brexit story is here, and it’s certainly not going to be the last. The Brexit referendum is the European news media’s Donald Trump - they’re going to milk the story for all it’s worth for years to come. The country is attempting a preemptive strike against the economic downturn that all the prophecies have predicted now that it is moving out of EU. Accordingly, the UK finance minister has [announced](http://in.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-osborne-idINKCN0ZJ0VN) plans to cut corporate tax rates from 20% to 15%. For some context, most developed countries average a corporate tax rate of 25%, India taxes at 35%. As the UK’s currency fell to 31-year lows in the foreign exchange markets, the Bank of England (UK’s central bank) [eased](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/05/bank-of-england-releases-150bn-pounds-risks-financial-stability) regulations on banks which freed up £150 billion that banks can lend to people and businesses. How does any of this relate to India? UK’s Business Secretary Sajid Javid (who sports a forehead that rivals that of Sonakshi Sinha’s) is [going](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/brexit-india-uk-to-hold-trade-talks/article8823969.ece) on a world tour of nations including India to hold discussions about a possible trade treaty. Seriously, google him right now. His head is more forehead than face. 

**LPT: Don’t Be Hungry In Kerala**

Incredible India is all good, but have you tasted the food here? Clearly, India is a fat man’s paradise. If you leave out Kerala, that is. The state just [imposed](http://food.ndtv.com/food-drinks/fat-tax-introduced-in-kerala-14-5-to-be-levied-on-fast-food-chains-like-mcdonalds-1429427) a 14.5% tax on food that makes you fatter, like burgers, pizzas, sandwiches, donuts etc. While subsidies are often used to encourage consumption of certain things, on the flip side, taxes are often used to discourage consumption of certain things. And Kerala’s government just wants to discourage fat people from being fat. The move is expected to bring in additional revenue of ₹10 crore to the state while mostly affecting fast food chains like McDonalds, Subway, Pizza Hut etc. The idea of a ‘fat tax’ is nothing new - it’s been implemented in countries like Denmark and Hungary, a country that sounds a lot like hungry. Coincidence? Definitely, yeah.

**Banks: Desperate Times, Desperate Measures**

Months after the banks started drowning in a pool of bad loans, the water level has come up enough to inspire some desperate deals. The nation’s second largest lender, ICICI had loaned ₹3,000 crore to Essar Steel, the Ruia-family owned company. But Essar has fallen on pretty hard times and can’t pay the loans back. So the banks got together and started searching for someone who can buy a majority stake in Essar, takeover the management and turn the company around. But it’s all fun and games until reality sets in - which is that nobody wants to even touch Essar Steel with a ten-foot pole. Last week, realizing that a solution was unlikely, ICICI [sold](http://www.livemint.com/Industry/8CVTPujGZTeE2W7iBUr45M/ICICI-Bank-sells-Essar-Steel-loan-exposure-to-Edelweiss-ARC.html) those loans worth about ₹1,600 crore to Edelweiss. The Jaypee Group, known perhaps for its cement business, found itself in similar condition where it had borrowed just a little more than it could handle. Fortunately, somebody did touch that company with a ten-foot pole. The company [sold](http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/buzzing-stocks/jp-associates-ultratech5-38rs-16189-cr-cement-deal_6982041.html) a lot of cement manufacturing plants to UltraTech Cement for ₹16,189 crore that it can potentially use to repay loans. To consolidate in times of trouble, State Bank of India is merging with its associate banks from Travancore, Mysore and others. But along with employees who fear being fired after the merger, a lot of businesses that are customers of the banks being acquired are [protesting](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/money-and-banking/now-customers-too-voice-concern-over-sbi-associate-banks-merger/article8807858.ece) the merger. Why? Well, how would you like it if your local grocery shopkeeper who knows you by name suddenly sold out to Big Bazaar?

**Loans From Flipkart**

The list of top 3 disasters in India goes like this: 1) the Bhopal Gas Tragedy, 2) Sholay-remake *Ram Gopal Verma Ki Aag* and 3) Flipkart’s Big Billion Day. The online retailer’s annual big sales event that comes every year started in 2014 and fetched the company ₹650 crore. But it was marred by failure in shipping which resulted in thousands of frustrated customers, and the company has been trying to rebuild the Big Billion Day brand ever since. The second Big Billion Day happened last year, raked in ₹2,000 crore for the company and sailed through relatively easily. This time, however, Flipkart feels shaky on being able to deliver without a glitch. It’s [making](http://thetechportal.com/2016/07/05/flipkart-brings-back-big-billion-day-major-changes/) plans to have a one huge Big Billion Day in the first week of October, followed by similar smaller events to spread the orders around. At a time when banks are becoming more cautious about lending to certain sectors of the economy, Flipkart is also planning to play matchmaker between banks and borrowers by offering pre-approved loans so you can buy now, pay later. The company is in talks with banks to arrange the loans which will be paid back by Flipkart in case people just decide to run with their Flipkart-bought flat screens and laptops.

Vijay Mallya’s old liquor company, United Spirits has [alleged](http://scroll.in/latest/811507/vijay-mallya-denies-united-spirits-limiteds-allegation-that-he-diverted-funds-worth-rs-1225-crore) that Mallya illegally diverted ₹1,225 crore of funds from the company to benefit his other companies such as the now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines and his Force India Formula One team. Mallya, however, insists that he did no such thing.

Millions of frustrated math students in schools across India have complained a million times about how nobody is ever going to use pythagorean theorems in real life. And how schools should teach something that people actually use in real life, like how to pay your taxes. Well, the Income Tax Department has taken that complaint to heart. As part of an effort to create a responsible taxpaying society, tax officials are set to [visit](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/i-t-officials-set-to-give-moral-science-lessons-in-schools/articleshow/53164515.cms) schools armed with powerpoints and statistics to teach kids all about taxes including how black money and tax evasion harms the economy.

People love freedom. Mostly because it has the word free in it. But Freedom 251 comes at a price. And that price is about ₹50,000 crore.

"An update to my story of rescuing puppies and some tips, essential information if you want to rescue some puppies too or just want to know what it takes to raise a dog without a mamma dog. Around 8 months back I posted this thread seeking help on rescuing puppies [that we found in the neighbourhood.](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/augpwm/need_a_little_help_with_these_rescued_puppies/) 

I know it's been a long time I haven't updated what happened thereafter because I got really busy with them. It wasn't easy raising them, they are just like human babies. 

**The journey until the weaning process:**

Soon after making the post in the afternoon I went to a pet store and got Royal Canin (RC) Babydog milk. The making of the milk was very easy, you just have to add warm water and mix according to the label. it comes with feeding bottle and different nipples for cats as well as for dogs. You can use little more or less powder according to your preference, depending how well the puppies are able to tolerate. It had a very bad smell, so bad that I had to wear some masks whenever I used to feed them lol. After few days I got adjusted to the smell. 

also we found out that the babies are only 1 weeks old, their mom died on the night before we took them home.

Don't forget he milk: There's two options that are generally available in pet stores. One is RC Babydog milk and another one is from Beapher Lactol which doesn't come in large packs, overall RC is cheaper (still costly)

Bedding: For bedding we used a hot bag in the lower portion of a carton (big amazon boxes), then some clothing, bed sheet on top of it and newspapers on top of all of them. Basically created a layer so they don't feel the hot bag but continue to get a warm environment. The temperature is extremely crucial to newborn babies as they aren't able to generate or regulate temperature on their own, they rely on their mother for it. The temperature shouldn't be too much or too low, place your hand on the top of bedding if the heat is tolerable only then place them on top of that else just add some little less hot water next time or put some more clothing in the box. Too much warmth can lead to hotspots, blisters on their skin. 

You have to keep in mind their feeding timeline too. For newborns according to breed size (pariah dogs are medium breeds) you have to feed them 8 times in 24 hours. Again you can break them in even more smaller batches. I used to feed them every 1 or 2 hours apart. Gradually increase the gap when they grow up. Don't feed them too much as that may lead to diarrhea. [Here's a chart printed on Royal Canin's Babydog milk.]

When it comes to toilet they don't urinate on their own. You have to take a cotton boll, dip in lukewarm water and stimulate their genitalia to make them urinate. For potty there's no option so keep them over newspaper and replace them when you see them doing potty. The potty is watery because well all  they are just drinking is milk. If you see them covered up in potty just take some cotton balls and clean them with lukewarm water. 

Take care of mosquitoes too, I used to keep some mosquito coils, or good knight burning all the time. 

All was going well until I ran out of RC Babydog milk, I couldn't find it in local pet stores. So I ordered online from Amazon. Was getting good deal on 2kg pack. Sadly it could arrive two days later. 

I contacted some vet and they said to give them amul spray. I didn't like this plan as cow milk has good amount of lactose which is bad for dogs. Seeing no option I had to give them the amul spray by mixing in water. 

It went fine for two days, no digestion issues popped up. Meanwhile the RC milk arrived, this is where comes the saddest part of raising them. 

None of them were able to tolerate the RC milk for some reason, they instantly vomited. Being a noob we continued to give them the RC milk. Three went back to normal ish but one didn't recover. We contacted another vet who told me it's probably because of sudden diet change. They have extremely sensitive stomach and any sudden change would screw them up. The amul spray we used to give had more lactose content which probably made their stomach bad with the lactose content that is why maybe they weren't able to tolerate the RC milk later. Vet told us to give less amount of powder in more water.

Few days later the dog which was affected worse died. :( 

This incident took a toll on other dogs too, they used to vomit a lot after eating. We couldn't find why but came to conclusion it's probably because they used to drink milk in a hurry. So we made some changes in feeding timeline and went with small batches inbetween so that they don't become very hungry. 

**The weaning process:**

1 month later I started the weaning process with Royal Canin Starter as suggested by vet. I tried first by giving them as it is but nope, they would smell  but wouldn't eat. Then I actually read instructions. :p

According to instructions I soaked them in lukewarm water, wait until the pellets become soft then mash them and make a porridge. It also had a very bad smell but tolerable. The smell is extremely important because that's what makes it attractive to them. They would just gobble up their food. I used to give it 5 times a day. Morning at 7am - 10am - 12pm - 6pm - 9pm. 

Yes you can give them rice, daal at this point but some won't like it. It's easier to feed them ""mashed pellets turned into a porridge"". If RC is costly for you Pedigree has same starter food. 

**The worst part of weaning process, the nightmares:** 

After few weeks later they weren't eating the porridge. Again being a noob I didn't understand that it's time to give them solid food because their teeth has grown. Also maybe they just got bored. 

I bought Pedigree starter and made same porridge. This time they ate like they used to before but again some days later they lost interest. That's when I found out it's time for them to eat solid foods. Also found out I'm supposed to give them Royal Canin Medium/Maxi Starter and not Mini. Yes these brands have created different products based on size of breeds. Confusing af. 

So anyway I got the Maxi starter, they used to eat but again stopped eating. This caused me nightmares and I had sleepless nights thinking why they aren't eating. 

Now Royal Canin was getting really costly as they grew up so I tried Pedigree Pro Starter. They liked it a lot but after some day same result, they won't eat. I tried many brands like Purina, Hill's and same result on everything. Luckily they found cheap Pedigree milk and chicken tasty and business as usual. But another problem started up, some used to vomit after eating. Again we found the culprit was eating too fast and drinking a lot of water after eating which is normal in pellet diet. 

After 1 month In between of those pellets and vomiting we tried rice, daal which they didn't like at first, but they absolutely loved rice+curd (amul masti dahi), then as they grew up we started giving them veggies, eggs which also they loved. 

The schedule was: veggies like potato, carrot, pumpkin in the morning. Curd rice at lunch and daal, roti at night. Eggs once a day. Our family has turned completely vegetarian so no nonveg like meat. I know it's foolish, I do give them Pedigree once in a while and eggs. The diet is still the same till date. Dogs are actually omnivorous unlike cats.

**Poops, urine everywhere..**

You'll see them finding their own spot for urinating and pooping, it's extremely crucial to train them else you'll have to deal with poops on floor and urines. Watch some videos on how to potty train, or better hire a trainer. We didn't do any of that in time and as a consequence mine poops everywhere. Still untill they get trained you have to deal with the poops. Better get cheap toilet paper rolls from Amazon, Bigbasket. Buy their own brand like Presto, Solimo and bbhome. To clean the urines get a scotch brite jumper spin mop and some microfiber clothes as they soak more water. Also keep lizol, dettol handy to clean the floor after each poop.

**The de-worming process.**

You have to deworm them periodically before the first vaccination, else vaccination will get wasted. Like humans they also have tapeworms, a lot. Vet suggested us Drontal puppy. You first need to weight the puppy and give 1ml/kg body weight. 

Now how do you weight the puppy? Weight yourself first in a scale then substract it from the weight of you holding the puppy on the scale. Drontal puppy suspension liquid comes with a dropper to measure and feed the puppy. 

Be prepared to see a lot of tapeworms coming out in dog's poop. ALWAYS directly apply dettol, lizol on floor and mop during this time. 

Deworm 14days in between during vaccinations.

**The vaccinations.**

After two months from the post (from their birth date) it was vaccination time. Our vet came to our home and did all the vaccinations. 

* 2 months after birth: DHPPi - For Canine Distemper, Hepatitis, Parvo virus and Para-influenza virus.

* 3 months after birth - 1 month after initial DHPPi - DHPPi booster. 

* 4 months after birth - 1 month after DHPPi booster - Rabies shot.

* 5 months after birth - 1 month after rabies shot: Corona shot. 

From second year onwards you have to give DHPPi booster, Rabies booster, and you can give cororna but I feel it's not necessary as this virus is not widespread in India. So two shots in total. 

Regarding charges doc charged us 2k for DHPPi, 2k for DHPPi booster, 1.7k for rabies and 1.8k for Corona. This is total cost of three dogs and doc's charge for coming to home. 


**The first bath:**

Ideally you shouldn't give them bath until few weeks past the first vaccine shot. But you can use Himalaya Freshcoat. You need to spray them over their coat and dry them off with a towel. After the first vaccine I'd suggest to wait for two weeks and give them bath in lukewarm water with Himalaya Erina Coat Cleanser shampoo.

**Holy mites (and fleas).**

If you are adopting a street dog then it's most likely to come with some parasites. Often it comes from mom and environment. You won't notice them until they are 1 or 1.5 and even later days months old. You'll probably notice some bumps, redness, poor coating, blood. Sadly our dogs came with parasites and got [affected in the worst way.](https://imgur.com/a/ApNnu1n) As we couldn't bath them until vaccination we had to use erina fresh coat spray and Erina powder. Those didn't help at all, there was flesh wounds. We used to give Wokazole lotion, Himalaya Scavon spray and they did help to recover from the wounds. They were also itching very badly so doc gave some injections (after first vaccination) which costed us ₹600. 

Those insects also affected me and my mom. Mites spread fast and also on humans. Luckily they don't last long on human. I got redness and bumps all over my elbow and shoulders during that time. My mom got itching for a month! She had to take some anti histamine. 

It's an endless battle. This issue is still present on them, I shower them with two shampoos: bolfo and erina coat cleanser every week with spot on application evey two months. Their coat is way better now. 

**The fights and battles:**

I got two males and one female dog. Earlier they used to eat together but as they grew up they started to fight with each other during eating. One would eat other's food but won't let anyone touch their plate lol. So had to give them food in three rooms which I still do. 

**My deteriorating health during this time:** 

I was really frustrated with the redness and bumps all over my body, also got deeply scratched by them. The scratch happened before they got their rabies vaccine so I was really scared of getting rabies as I didn't have any prior rabies vaccination. I went to a doc and he suggested 5 dose of rabies vaccine on  day 0, 3rd, 7tg, 14th and 28th day.

 Then one day when they were fighting I tried to separate them and by mistake my thumb got punctured into one's lower tooth. It was very deep so I got even more scared, there was endless blood, pain. I washed my thumb into running tap water and also used detergent. Went to same doc in evening, he said not to worry as I was already getting vaccinations so RiG is not needed (Rabies immunoglobulin). He gave me instructions to complete 3 tetanus shots and gave some antibiotic ointment. 

During my last rabies shot I got pneumonia/bronchitis, wasn't able to get up from bed, Had extreme fever of 104-105 and fever stayed there for three days straight, also was experiencing terrible chest pain while getting up or trying to sleep. Mom went to medicine shop and they gave some paracetamol and antibiotic which helped a little but the fever woukd again shot up to 104-105. 

Four days later I went to doc and he gave me same paracetamol, antibiotic but also added penicillin.Which helped tremendously and my fever was gone in next few days. 

But after the fever went away the chest pain didn't. It haunted me for months. Doc prescribed some paracetamol to help and some syrup. In the end it went away. 

Meanwhile while visiting the medicine shop for my last vaccine of rabies they said it won't help if I get the rabies shot that time because it was late. In confusion wheather to start rabies shots again from day 0, I took the last shot and went to doc. He said no worries. 

**Finally here's how they looks now:**

[This one is a male, we call him babla/tiya(Bengali name, tiya means parrot).](https://i.imgur.com/WcIt2Xv.jpg) He's nicest of the bunch, always stays away from fight.

* Here's how he looked when he was around [2 months old.](https://imgur.com/a/iPPUzYgk)

[This one is also a male, we call him Ananda (Happiness).](https://i.imgur.com/xRT2gM9.jpg) He's quite the troublemaker, always fighting, biting and peeing everywhere.

* Here's how she looked when she was around [2 months old.](https://imgur.com/a/1W3Z8XT)

**Some do and don'ts for someone willing to rescue a puppy, or looking to own a dog:**

**Do:**

* Always consult a vet.

* For strays check with locals for approx date of birth, it helps. 

* Stock cheap toilet papers, cotton balls, lizol, dettol, newspapers. You are gonna need it. 

* Always clean floor with dettol after they do their business if they aren't trained. 

* Buy Erina Freshcoat, Erina EP powder. Use them until first bath, this will help with parasites. Also any clotrimazole dusting powder during rainy seasons. Wokazole Plus lotion, scavon spray.

* Deworm properly and carefully. 

* If you are giving them amul milk, amul spray make sure to use little milk, powder and mix with water. 

* Pedigree Pro is a good alternative to Royal Canin. 

* Fresh veggies and foods should be prioritised over pellets. (If you have time)

* Give them treats when they are nice and obeyes your orders. Like hug them a lot. 

* Trim their nails frequently.

**Don't:**

* Do not suddenly change their diet when they are young, this could turn into fata casuality. Always keep in mind the transition period where you have to mix some of old food with new food and gradually increase new food over the period. 

* For newborns ALWAYS check for bedding temperature. Make sure it's tolerable, not too high or low. 

* Milk is always a no no. Curd is good because it has probiotics which helps with digestion. My dog loves amul masti dahi. 

* Don't leave too much gap between meals for young dogs, if their  stomach gets too much empty they'll might vomit during morning or anytime. 

**Was it worth it?**

I would say yes, during this time I got really attached to them. I knew what it takes to raise a child. 

Yes they are always fighting, ruined our walls, our new sofa, our washing machine cover. Our fridge. They wake me up at 5 demanding breakfast, there was a time when I had to wake up at 5 to make breakfast for them. One urinates like fountain. One urinates everywhere. I always get scratched by them. We spent about  ₹10-15k in vaccines, milk, endless bottles of shampoos, scavon spray, Wokazole lotion, spot-ons. 

But all those nuisance doesn't feel bad at all whenever my sister comes home from work and they licks her face with love. You got to see them in person lol, they would make different sounds, gets all excited after hearing door bell then jumps onto her. Same with me and my mom whenever we enter home. 

This turned out to be quite a long post, so sorry for that. Also sorry to everyone who has pmed me and I didn't reply, I was really busy with all these.

"[Stupid but serious question] Won't there be a point where loss of life and economy due to lockdown will be greater than loss of life due to coronavirus? I am from West Bengal. And honestly, the lockdown is scaring me really bad. The prices of food items like potatoes, tomatoes, etc have risen significantly, or the supplies are almost finished. Many shops which sell basic groceries are closed and their owners say they are afraid if they will be arrested by the police even though groceries have been exempted. Even though I am from a middle class family, I know many low income families who are more paranoid about this situation. If people don't get to eat, they will die from hunger anyways.

I don't know about Economics, but is there a possibility that people might die more because of the lockdown rather than coronavirus? Many vegetables are absolutely finished in our local markets, and given that most vegetables, meat, etc come through local trains which are now non-operational, how will we get basic stuff like food? From what I know, poor people still have ration card to meet their requirements, and rich people, well, have their money to get through the system. What about most of us? 

Another thing is jobs. Due to these shutdowns, the businesses will face huge losses, jobs like hawkers, small shops, cottage industries, chaiwala, panwala, panipuriwala, etc will mostly go without any money. And if this lockdown is extended, which it most probably will, won't several million people just die due to lack of money and food?

Edit: I sometimes go on Libertarian sub (curiosity) and there someone said this that the population cannot sustain this and that this can be solved by just quarantining the old people and nothing else, i.e., no lockdown or travel ban or anything, just quarantining of old people because Covid 19 apparently doesn't harm young people. Is this really a sound solution?",Food

I'm quite worried I won't be able to eat for a few days. Oh yes and no home delivery resturant will be open.",Food

"Ever heard of a movie called omertà? A cult Rajkumar Rao movie that vanished after release.

"Kota District Collector's letter to the parents of IIT aspirants [NP] Dear Parents,

On behalf of Kota City, I take this opportunity to welcome your child to a city of wonders which processes the young minds of this country and fuels their passion to become the architects of Modern India.

My humble request at the beginning of this letter is to read this with some patience and time and it would be ideal if both the parents can read this together.

It is the dream of every parent to see his child touch the pinnacles of success and reach places which only few can afford. Every parent plants a seed in the mind of the child which over a period of time bears fruits but after careful nourishment and tendering since the seed is so tender that any mishandling may fail us from realizing our dream.

It is a very difficult situation for parents to leave their child in a place where they do not live and things become still difficult when the purpose for which the child is left behind is for dedicated and committed efforts in scaling excellence in education.

When parents look at the huge billboard signage/hoarding/ newspaper clips depicting pictures of young beautiful children who have achieved what they dream for their child, the resolution to inspire and motivate their children becomes still stronger.

Good career in the field of Engineering & Medicine, as the case may be, is more or less like certain insurance in terms of decent earning and living standards. I sincerely think that in most of the cases, this is the very reason that makes us dream such careers for our children.

There is nothing wrong in thinking on a certain kind of Assured Career Insurance for one’s child since limited resources and high degree of competition demands one to think ahead of times.

However, I think we all agree that the world too has changed drastically in the last 15-20 years so much so, that most of the facilities and services that were available for a limited few are now available to many due to the huge progress in technology which was witnessed in this period.

Art, Entertainment, Professional Sports, Literature, Health & Fitness, Entrepreneurship, Journalism, Photography, Event management, Music, Adventure, Destination tourism, etc, to name a few too witnessed immense growth in comparison to the bygone era.

Many of these even created a new niche which not just nurtured creative potential of the human mind and its capabilities but also were very successful career options.

Well, the point is not about asking you to see them as better options but certainly to see them also as options.

It is a matter of fact that today, young children are facing immense amount of pressure relating to their academic performance and due to the same many of them go through various levels of stress.

Even if we consider that a certain element of stress would exist in competition parental support, care and the right kind of family situations would help the child to cope with any difficult situation.

However, current reality is that due to the lack of right kind of conditions and support systems, many children are going through stress uncared and unattended for and in a few cases such situations disabled the children to such an extreme extent that they committed suicide…

Don’t get frightened suddenly as to what is being said about your child… Your child is perfectly safe and sound and you have no reasons to worry, but you have reasons to have concern of your child which I believe you will understand as we read my letter further.

I consider myself a very unfortunate person because I got a chance to read around 20-25 Suicide Notes of Young, Brilliant, Beautiful and Wonderful Children.

Am I giving so many adjectives to such children because they committed Suicide?

I am sorry. Answer is No… They were in fact, as I said earlier, Young, Brilliant, Beautiful and Wonderful Children.

A Girl with an amazing command of English language in her suicide note (grammatically perfect 5-page Suicide Note with beautiful running handwriting) thanks her mother for giving up her career for raising the children… Subtle hint that she was pricked on this matter again and again.

Another girl wants her grandmother to become her mother in her next birth. Another requests her parents to allow her younger sister to do what she likes and not what they like. One tells candidly that he was manipulated to study science which was not his taste. Many simply write in fewer lines that they could not fulfil the expectations of their parents. Rather few say they were not really capable of doing what is being asked for by them.

All of them thought that Death was a much peaceful and effortless action than going through this dilemma of artificially doing what parents want them to do.

As they say “Tip of the Iceberg” reveals little and hides mountains within, similarly apparent Suicide Cases reflect numbers but reality or the hidden mountain is all those children who did not opt to take this extreme step but certainly are going through stress/worry/anxiety due to pressure on performance.

Many Parents cannot believe after the disaster that it was their own child who took such a drastic measure and I don’t mean to hurt their sentiments any further but the reality is that the child was mentally looking for some blade of grass which a drowning man searches for. That blade of grass could have been your simple appreciation of his efforts… your solacing words of comforts of asking him to do his best and forget the results your absolute unconditioned appreciation of his extraordinariness.

In return, what the child got was threats of performing still better…psychological manipulation by repeat and re-telecasting of the hardships you have gone through for the sake of family. comparison with better performers (neighbors, relatives, children of colleague, ancestors…could be anyone) sharing imagination on the loss/notional gain of social status being dependent on child’ s performance.

We need to understand that statistically speaking not many children commit suicide in comparison to the total number of children coping with such academic pressure if we analyze the numbers but life analysis tells us that their hopes and dreams are overlooked and hurt many a times. So it is high time we pause and contemplate a bit. I need to take a pause here since I hear many of you saying kids do not like many things which are good for them. So the question I tend to hear from you is… Should parents go childrenâ€™s immature ways? Not necessarily.

Well let us try to see what all good things they resisted… Eating right, sleeping right, talking right, behaving right, seeing right, listening right, reading right etc.

Child actually observes parents and never follows anything blindly. Moreover, there is one thing which is certain… Child analyses and looks at the parents to see whether in case any of those things preached are followed by parents to begin with and if so..Whether their parents are really loving, joyful, peaceful and happy by doing so.

They tend to pick up only those habits of their parents that make them happy and peaceful…In case you have seriously messed up situations, your child may even not like you.

It may appear strange and extremely annoying… But there is a possibility of your child not liking you… This comes in many forms and shades. Absolute dislike, not liking few traits of yours, not liking you by comparing you with someone better, not liking you for your over protective care and concern which you may think as love but is suffocating for the child, not liking you for your double standards (we may have…) etc.

So, is it the objective of this letter to make you realise that your child dislikes you?

Answer again is a big No.. Your child does not dislike you… I am just making a point that unconsciously we may have created such a situation, which we need to undo…

Children are parents’ responsibility and we are no one to teach a parent their responsibility nor do we intend to do so… Parents really think good for their children’s future but the point I need to make is that your dreams are always limited to your experience of what is good… what is successful… what is the best thing… Well, the truth is your child may surpass your imagination and reach places which you never even dreamed of…

We all come from different segments of the society in terms of social & economic status, culture, religion, belief systems etc. However as far the natural principle of upbringing a child is concerned they remain the same everywhere.

I am not an expert in Parenting nor have many credentials in “Right Child Care Practices” and I fully understand that different kind of children need different kind of interventions yet I would request you to divert little attention to these fundamental aspects relating to child management.

Creating the right kind of atmosphere for the child to grow and flower in home by making home a really happy, loving and peaceful place to live.
Understanding the needs of the children. There are two extremes in this case…Making the child go through terrible hardships to realise “Your” dreams is one end and the other end is over-pampered care… Both of them definitely do not work.

Take time to switch from teaching mode to learning mode from the child since children show you the way to be really happy and peaceful at times…Instead of learning form them we tend to always assume the role of teacher/preacher.

Allow the child “to be” on his own terms and here I mean especially the child’s engagement with nature and world around and empower them with the right kind of communication skills which are more accommodative. Interaction with the other gender due to their coming of age is not an aberration but a normal process, which you can keep a note on but not try to prevent it totally.

Spend time with children without complaining of your office, life situation, problems, hardships all the timeâ€¦. It may be really too late before you want to spend and there is no more time available with the child. Why? Because we may have made him just like ourselves in an effort to tutor him. We certainly are not the benchmark for the child. Many a times, we may be regressive rudimentary types in comparison to the ability of the child.

Just a final thought. Are we interested in making the child realise “Your Dreams” at any cost or should it be like creating such situations that the child realises “His/Her” Dreams?

I could have simply attended a Parents Counselling Session during admission and spoken on these issues but usually it so happens that in such gatherings we are conditioned and influenced more by impression of the person sitting next to you or people who think different.

Nothing wrong in disagreeing but it is best to disagree on own terms instead of getting influenced by others. Finally, I would like to tender my unconditional apology for taking your time and telling you things about Child Management in which I am no expert and my words in this letter have been gathered by my limited experience in Kota dealing with similar cases and certainly there are great men who have inspired me to put my thoughts before you.

Be the Best Parent in the World!!!!
I am sure there is no competition there

	1.	Are NRC and CAA separate?

Yes. 

NRC is not a law, It is a process mandated by  the Indian Citizenship ( Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Cards) Rules 2003.
Source

But are they connected? 

YES.

Since any rules issued from time to time by the government are taken into consideration while interpreting any law. In fact there is a clause in every Act specifying the same, in our case, Section 18 of the Indian Citizenship Act 1955.

Source

	2.	What is the CAA, how can it be misused?

(a) CAA and why it’s unconstitutional

The core idea is to make it easier for  undocumented immigrants from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan to get Indian citizenship. The catch is that these immigrants can’t be Muslims.

Are there really ‘persecuted minorities’ that would benefit from this legislation?

Yes, 31,313 individuals to be precise.
This was revealed by the government itself during a hearing by a parliamentary committee on the 2016 version of the Bill. The committee had asked how many people would benefit from the legislation. The Intelligence Bureau replied:


But by specifically excluding Muslims (and Jews), the Bill has raised justified concerns that the Modi government is trying to enshrine religious discrimination into law. 

This when Article 14 of India’s constitution prohibits discrimination on religious basis.

Why does this Act violate Article 14?

Article 14 is Equality of Law.

‘the state shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of laws within the territory of India prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth’

The opposition MPs had pointed this out but Amit Shah insisted the exception to Article 14, “reasonable classification” when making laws. 

In simple words the State can discriminate between citizens on above grounds if special benefits are offered to them for eg; reservations for marginalised communities.

This matter of whether “reasonable classification” is justified is why the Act is being contended in the Courts and will be decided later.

(b) How can CAA be misused?

CAA can be amended only by parliamentary procedures. 

The government has said that the amendment was made to provide remedy to the six communities namely Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi or Christian community from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan seeking shelter from religious persecution or fear of religious persecution.

However, religious persecution is not cited anywhere in the CAA, 2019. The bare act reads:

""Provided that any person belonging to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi or Christian community from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan, who entered into India on or before the 31st day of December, 2014 and who has been exempted by the Central Government by or under clause (c) of sub-section (2) of section 3 of the Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920 or from the application of the provisions of the Foreigners Act, 1946 or any rule or order made thereunder, shall not be treated as illegal migrant for the purposes of this Act;"" 



Religious persecution is actually mentioned under the Rules to the amended Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920.



This is very important to understand because the Government can make changes to these rules anytime they want. Rules are basically subordinate laws that the central government can issue through a gazette notification at any time. These laws do not require the approval of the parliament.


*The above point will be important while explaining NRC.

3. What is the NRC?

The National Register of Citizens (NRC) is a registry maintained by the Government of India containing names & certain relevant information for identification of Indian citizens. 

The Nationwide NRC is as a process already underway through the NPR, which is proposed to be implemented in the 2021 census.

(a) What is the NPR?

The NPR is a list of “usual residents of the country”. According to the Ministry of Home Affairs, a “usual resident of the country” is one who has been residing in a local area for at least the last six months, or intends to stay in a particular location for the next six months. 

Unlike the NRC, the NPR is not a citizenship enumeration drive, as it would record even a foreigner staying in a locality for more than six months.
 It is mandatory for every “usual resident of India” to register in the NPR.

The NPR will collect both demographic data and biometric data. There are 15 different categories of demographic data, ranging from name and place of birth to education and occupation, that the RGI is supposed to collect in the NPR. 

For biometric data it will depend on Aadhaar, for which it will seek Aadhaar details of the residents. This will allow the Union government, for the first time, to connect their biometric details with information like the birthplace of their parents.

Apart from this, in a test run going on across the country, the RGI is seeking details of mobile number, Aadhaar, PAN card, Driving Licence, Voter ID card and passport (in case the resident is Indian). It is also working to update the Civil Registration System of birth and death certificates.

Even as issues of privacy associated with Aadhaar continue to be debated in the country, the NPR is on a drive to collect detailed data on residents of India. With the recent introduction of Personal Data Protection Bill, in which the Centre exempts its agencies from some or all provisions of the proposed bill there are a lot of red flags being raised about misuse of such data.

Source

(b) How is NPR linked to the NRC?

The legal framework for the National Population Register is grounded in the Citizenship Act, 1955. In 2003, the Act was amended by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led BJP government to introduce the category of an “illegal migrant”. To implement this amendment, a set of rules were issued. 

(The link to the rules is the same as 1. Are CAA and NRC different)

The rules read: “The Central Government shall, for the purpose of National Register of Indian Citizens, cause to carry throughout the country a house-to-house enumeration for collection of specified particulars relating to each family and individual, residing in a local area including the Citizenship status”.

How would these registers of citizens be created? The rules explicitly spell it out: 

“The Local Register of Indian citizens shall contain details of persons after due verification made from the Population Register.”

When the Local Register is generated from the Population Register, a “verification process” would be carried out which would create the category of “doubtful citizenship”. 

The final National Register of Citizens would be prepared by asking doubtful citizens to prove they are Indians as part of a “claims and objections” process.

This Population Register mentioned in the rules is nothing other than the National Population Register.

 In a gazette notification issued on July 31, 2019, the Modi government passed an order to “prepare and update the Population Register” in every state other than Assam.

(c) Arguments against NRC.

	(i).	A botched exercise in Assam

The National Register of Citizens in Assam was updated over the past few years to identify undocumented migrants who had come mostly from Bangladesh after 1971. 

The updated NRC was supposed to document all those people whose names were listed in the NRC of 1951 and were still alive as well as their living descendants who could prove they were permanent residents of the state.

It was a botched exercise. There were many errors during the process.
Source

 In all, around 19 lakh people in Assam were excluded from the final register. 
Source

Soon, the BJP started complaining that many undocumented immigrants had been included in the register, while around five lakh Bengali Hindus were excluded. In fact, even some people who had campaigned for the BJP found themselves excluded.

Source: BJP complaining about a botched NRC
Source: 5 lakh Bengali Hindus excluded in NRC
Source: BJP campaigners find themselves excluded

Anyone who is not able to prove citizenship under NRC is put in detention centres.
Reports of the violation of Human rights in these detention centres is alarming.

Source: A newborn died in a detention centre in Assam. Their mother was later found not to be a foreigner.


	(ii).	Loopholes and inconsistencies in the existing citizenship laws

There is a lot of speculation around cut off dates and proving of ancestry based on the pilot NRC launched in Assam but nothing concrete so far can be determined since the nation wide Bill hasn’t been drafted.

But one thing we know for sure - every person resident in India will be required to prove their citizenship.

How does one prove their citizenship?

This is where matters get complex.

If we don’t consider the speculated ancestry provision which may or may not be included in the nation wide NRC, The current law for citizenship is as follows -


The Citizenship Act defines a citizen as:

Section 3:

Citizenship by birth —

(1) Except as provided in sub-section (2), every person born in India,—
(a) on or after the 26th day of January, 1950, but before the 1st day of July, 1987;

(b) on or after the 1st day of July, 1987, but before the commencement of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2003 and either of whose parents is a citizen of India at the time of his birth;

(c) on or after the commencement of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2003, where—
(i) both of his parents are citizens of India; or
(ii) one of whose parents is a citizen of India and the other is not an illegal migrant at the time of his birth, 

shall be a citizen of India by birth.

Short of this is,

If you were born in India before 1987 but after 1950, you are a citizen.

If you were born after 1987 but before 2003 and either of your parents are Indian citizens, you are a citizen.

If you were born after 2003 and both your parents are Indian citizens or one of your parents is an Indian citizen and the other is not an illegal immigrant, you are a citizen.

So if you were born before 1987, you’re an Indian citizen by birth.

If you’re born after 1987 you have to prove that your parents are Indian citizens. (What about the orphans?)

How do you do it?

If you’re born before 1987, you can prove citizenship by provision of birth certificate or other documents as may be prescribed by the NRC.

Assuming your parents were educated and organised enough they would be able to preserve your birth certificate and other such documents but people from lower middle class or slightly under privileged backgrounds may not have done the same because they weren’t educated and informed enough about the importance of these documents. This leaves a person in a state of handicap.


If you’re born after 1987, considering that  almost 44% of India’s population is under  24 years of age and a total 85% of the population is under 54 years of age, we can safely conclude the above group constitutes a large chunk of India’s population.

You have to prove that at least one of your parents is an Indian citizen. So if you’re born after 1987 naturally your parents are born before 1987. You’ll have to provide the necessary documents of YOUR PARENTS
to prove THEY’RE Indian citizens. Basically they expect you to preserve and possess documents dating back to as much as the 1960’s.

Many news agencies are reporting that mere submitting of passports and Aadhar cards shall suffice and THIS IS ABSOLUTELY FALSE.

Mere submitting of passports, birth certificate shall not suffice to prove citizenship, this was ruled by Bombay high court in 2013.
Source

In conclusion,
67% of our population is still rural as per the 2015 census. This coupled with inadequate infrastructure and lacking admin capacities to implement a nationwide program like this would be a disaster.

	(iii).	Why NRC promotes inequality against the Muslims?

Imagine a scenario where a nationwide NPR is rolled out. The babus administering the exercise mess up and end up sending a whole bunch of people  of all faiths a “specified proforma” from the register. 


Now, a legal recourse is available only to people of the six religions mentioned in the CAA. Do note that the law specifically says that people belonging to these faiths “shall not be treated as illegal migrants"". Muslims, however, will not have any such recourse. For that matter, even Jews won’t be able to do anything about their exclusion from the register. 

As a result, lakhs and crores of excluded people might have to declare that they are illegal immigrants to become Indian citizens again.

The tricky part is proving religious  persecution in another country.

To benefit from the CAA, the person issued a specified proforma by the NPR must prove that, one, they are a non-Muslim migrant from Afghanistan, Pakistan or Bangladesh, 

and, two, that they came to India to escape religious persecution. 

*(read with the point mentioned in CAA) But because the Government can make the rules under the Passport Act essentially at whim, the government can simply strike out the second condition and keep only the first.

	(iv).	Economic cost

The Global economy is on a slowdown and India is no exception to it, I generally never attribute GDP numbers with a Government since the only active participation of a Government in a GDP is via public expenditure which is still crucial. However, when a Government actively makes policies which are detrimental to the state of the economy, then fingers will be pointed.

This is the case with NRC.

 In Assam alone it cost 1220 crores - 1500 crores and ended up in a massive failure.
Source:
 
The national cost of implementing the NRC would run into lakhs of crores. With the Indian economy in its current situation, implementing NRC would surely leave a visible dent on the Indian economy. Especially when there is absence of any ROI (Return on Investment) from such a policy.

The estimated cost of this might be close to 2-3 lakh crores (unverified).

Source: This is an opinion piece and the figures may have the effect of being inflated or underestimated.

Say, it costs 3 lakh crores, it’s still just 1.57% of our last year’s GDP i.e. $2.72 Trillion.

However, just like Demonetisation this act will bring the country to a halt. People will have to line up yet again at verification centres, for document verification, follow ups & enquiries. 

In Assam, the NRC updating started on July 30, 2018 and ended on August 31, 2019 and despite taking over an year to complete this process, the entire process ended up in material inconsistencies and glaring errors.
Source:

A nation-wide implementation would cost years in loss of productivity and the economic cost of this practice would be dangerous.

Demonetisation caused the GDP growth to drop to 6.1%, though it recovered in the later quarters and consumption patterns stabilised too.
Source:.

Over 1.5 million jobs were lost in Q3 of FY 2016-17 post implementation of demonetisation.
Source CMIE report.

The nation wide implementation of NRC will have a similar or larger impact on the economy but this time it will come with a substantial human cost.

	(v).	Cost of Error

The NRC exercise would be highly prone to error—both Type I and Type II. 

Explanation:

Type I errors:  False positives 

Mistakenly identifying a person as an immigrant from protected minority communities such as Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan, and erroneously giving them the benefit of Indian citizenship. 

Immigrants are usually a net economic benefit; so the costs of Type I errors are only confined to national security. 

These costs are not nationwide and typically limited to a handful of border districts in India.


Type II errors: False negatives

These occur when those who qualify as Indian citizens are mistakenly categorized as illegal immigrants. A nationwide NRC, if similar to the one in Assam, would imply that false negatives get sent to detention centres or deported.

Type II errors are extremely costly. To minimize false negatives, the bar to qualify as a citizen has to be very simple and easily identifiable. 

Also, infrastructure to scrutinize the paperwork for the NRC has to be exceptionally efficient. 

The Indian state usually fails on both counts. Given the CAB’s current religious exclusionary basis, Muslims are at higher risk of exclusion through false negatives, though all groups, including Hindus, are likely to be affected by errors.


There are three main issues to consider here. 


The first is the trade-off between Type I and Type II errors. 

If, to avoid false positives, the government has a high level of scrutiny for NRC inclusion, all individuals will have the burden of meeting this higher bar. In the process, some might be mistakenly excluded. 

On the other hand, if the bar is set very low to prevent false negatives and erroneous exclusions, then some illegal immigrants may slip through the cracks. 
The current CAB framework, combined with the NRC, is set up to minimize false positives, which will automatically increase false negatives.


The third issue is of the magnitude of error.

1) If Govt executes well with 5% error, 67.5 million people will be displaced (equalling displacement by WW II)

2) If it has Aadhaar error rate (8.8%) 120 million will be left out.

3) If it has 1% error, still 13.5 million Indians will be displaced (same as partition of India)

Both the source materials for the data above are opinion pieces since the numbers can only be estimated as of now and should be read accordingly.

**Apple’s New China Is India**

When Steve Jobs, ex-hippie and the founder of Apple, visited India in the 1970s, he wore a lungi and [roamed](http://gadgets.ndtv.com/others/news/what-steve-jobs-did-in-india-35-years-ago-225246) barefoot. Until, of course, the Indian national disease of diarrhea cut his trip short and sent him back to the US. Fortunately for all of us, when Tim Cook, the current CEO of Apple, visited India last week his attire did not include a lungi and he probably drank bottled water, as is tradition for all foreign tourists in India. In between wild Bollywood parties at SRK’s house and IPL matches in Kanpur, Tim [announced](http://www.wsj.com/articles/apples-tim-cook-samples-bollywood-cricket-in-bid-to-woo-india-1463822223) a startup accelerator in Bengaluru and the opening of two new offices including one in Hyderabad. It wasn’t all play and no work - Tim met with businessmen like the CEOs of ICICI Bank, Vodafone India, TCS and heads of state like Prime Minister Modi, the Telangana CM and many more. But why India and why now? After reporting the first quarterly decline in sales that was largely caused due to slowing growth in China, Apple is now searching for something other than China to fuel growth for the coming decade. And Apple’s next China might just be India. Tim termed his visit to India as ‘fantastic’ but then again, he also ran into Alia Bhatt. So it’s entirely possible that his statements were laced with sarcasm.  

**The One With Trump, Brexit and India**

Britain, the former colonial master of India and more countries than you can even name, is going through an independence movement of its own. Currently, the country is a part of the European Union, a political and economic union of 28 countries in Europe. In a public vote to be held on June 23rd, Britishers will decide if the nation will stay in the European Union or get out of the European Union. All of that may be Britain’s headache but a new report out of SBI [suggests](http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-brexit-can-open-up-opportunities-for-india-sbi-research-report-2212552) that even though a Brexit (Britain leaving the European Union) could be terrible for Europe, it could turn out to be hugely beneficial for India since Indian companies will no longer need to follow complex trade agreements while dealing with Britain. Likewise, a former US Diplomat says a Trump presidency in the US, while [terrible](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/if-donald-trump-becomes-us-president-india-may-gain-at-chinas-expense-heres-why/articleshow/52380459.cms) for China and Pakistan (...not to mention Mexico) might actually turn out to be great for India as ~~Donald Trump~~ Dear Leader’s foreign policies are likely to shift the balance of power in Asia in favour of India. The word to describe what you’re feeling right now is schadenfreude - taking pleasure in the misfortunes of others. Trust me, *I know words. I have the best [words.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T-Eo0j092Q)*

**The Banking Bloodbath**

With the whole bad loans crisis being shoved in everyone’s faces, it’s no surprise that banks are feeling the heat. Saddled with a ton of losses caused by increasing net non-performing assets (the fancy term for bad loans), conditions are becoming dire. A host of smaller banks reported earnings last week and it’s not good. If you have a phobia of falling bank profits, turn away now and seek professional help because it’s about to get gruesome. Alright, [here](http://www.livemint.com/Money/1MpJ5uNbQXhacOWKTo3PWJ/PSU-banks-shares-fall-after-weak-earnings.html) we go: Dena Bank reported a loss of ₹326 crore, Allahabad Bank reported a loss of ₹581 crore, Central Bank of India reported a loss of ₹898 crore, UCO Bank reported a loss of ₹1,715 crore and Syndicate Bank [reported](http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/results/syndicate-bank-q4-loss-at-rs-2158cr-provisions-jump-3-fold_6677621.html) a loss of ₹2,158 crore. Going for the silver medal is Bank of Baroda with a loss of ₹3,230 crore, the second highest loss in the history of Indian banking. And now, for the gold medal, the worst loss in the history of Indian banking ever was reported at a record-breaking ₹5,367 crore by *drumroll* Punjab National Bank. It feels good to have found the rock-bottom at last. At least now, there is nowhere to go but up. That’s what investors in bank stocks are saying to themselves so they can sleep well at night. Let’s hope for their sake that we don’t find a new bottom in the next quarter.

**|| || || > | | | | | |**

So you might’ve heard: The banking industry is in a bit of a tight spot. There haven’t been any bankruptcies (phew) yet. But there’s blood on the streets. And the only way to patch the wound is to stick together in times of trouble. State Bank of India, one of the largest banks in India, [proposed](http://profit.ndtv.com/news/industries/article-bank-of-india-says-no-talks-on-merging-with-any-other-lenders-1408323) a plan to stick together and merge with its 5 associate banks: State Bank of Bikaner & Jaipur, State Bank of Hyderabad, State Bank of Travancore, State Bank of Patiala and State Bank of Mysore plus the newly created Bharatiya Mahila Bank. If merged, the combined bank will become a banking behemoth with 50 crore customers. And behemoths don’t bleed easy. Taking cue, the government is also urging UCO Bank, Bank of India and Indian Overseas Bank (all of whom have reported losses) to find themselves a relatively well off bank and merge their losses away. Playing the merger game is tricky business. You don’t want your merger to be like Romeo and Juliet. Sure, they made history but they both died in the end. You want your merger to be like Aladdin and Princess Jasmine. One that can live happily ever after.

Narayana Murthy, co-founder of Infosys, however has in the past suggested that the highest salary paid in a company shouldn’t be more than 25 times the lowest salary paid in the company.

* Vijay Mallya, who has indirectly paid the salaries of thousands of journalists around the world along with Donald Trump, is scared. He’s scared that Indians will come after him with pitchforks if he ever returns from the UK. Accordingly, Mallya [says](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/vijay-mallya-fugitive-businessman-consider-india-return-if-safety-freedom-assured-1560279) he’ll only return if his safety and freedom is assured. GOI’s formal request to the British government to extradite Mallya was declined. More problems to boot: A ₹2.4 crore dividend payable to Mallya from United Breweries was withheld.

They say there’s no use digging up old corpses. And declassifying old government records can sometimes certainly feel like digging up old corpses. Well, this time the government might have found a zombie. After releasing old records relating to the Azad Hind Bank, founded by Subhash Chandra Bose, many borrowers have [approached](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2016-05-16/news/73126343_1_currency-notes-bank-notes-legal-tender) the finance ministry asking the government to recognize the currency issued by the Azad Hind Bank in 1944 as legal tender, so they can use it to repay existing loans. In a country of more than a billion people, there’s potential for more than a billion bizarre stories. And this is just one. 

$1 billion is the number of the week for Apple. $1 billion is the amount that Warren Buffett, the billionaire that has traditionally and even proudly shunned technology, has [invested](http://www.economist.com/news/business/21699139-meaning-two-odd-and-connected-investments-1-billion-stakes-menu) in Apple shares over the last quarter. $1 billion is also the amount that Apple invested in Didi, not the Bengali politician, but Uber’s competitor in China. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick’s girlfriend, reportedly owns shares of Apple, which makes her an investor in Didi. That’s got to make for some very awkward pillow talk.

"The identity crisis of Middle India It is often said of India’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, that he was the last Englishman to rule India. The saying carries some element of truth to it. Nehru may have been born in Allahabad, but his heart lay in the Shires and Oxbridge. This showed through in his language, cultural sensibilities, and overall, the parliamentary democracy that he guided us towards. He was a towering intellect, but unlike his contemporaries who were by and large bilingual intellectuals, his writings were mainly in English. He could give a speech in Hindi, but his knowledge of the tongue ended there. His sensibilities were English and it is to his credit that being so English and upper class as he was, he could mingle with just about anyone from the classes or the masses in a country as diverse as India.

One of Nehru’s primary concerns at Independence was the building of a national identity. India, under the British, was a loose confederation of states that recognized the paramountcy of the British and its people subscribed to only a vague sense of ‘Indian-ness’ that was never formally defined. Nor was such a definition even required. The Tamil in the far south was as unconcerned with the Punjabi in the far north, as was the Bengali with the Gujarati. As far as the common man was concerned, they mainly subscribed to more or less the same set of cultural values. There really was no concept of a political union called India. Indeed, the idea of a country called India, was born with independence and the dissolution of the British raj. However, the dissolution of the British Raj also brought with it partition and all its communal horrors. The lack of a common identity between the Hindu and the Muslim tore once harmonious communities apart. Nehru and his contemporaries realized that the fabric that held this nation together was frayed at the edges and would soon tear apart. It was of utmost importance, therefore, to cultivate a common identity of Indian-ness, and suppress any alternate cultural or regional identity.

We have all been part of this identity formation, whether it took the form of singing the national anthem every morning at school, or by learning the names of various and far flung rivers of the nation. And by and large, we have succeeded. A Tamilian today cheers for “Enga thalai Dhoni”, a man from Ranchi, Jharkhand with as much fervor as the Punjabi, the Bengali or the Gujarati. A common identity has been built and there is little talk of separatism in the Indian heartland. What separatism exists has literally been pushed to the fringes of the nation and is on the verge of fizzling out itself. The political unification of India has been a success.

Culturally though, we remain as diverse as ever, and a unified identity is something that is neither attainable nor desirable. In many areas of India, language remains a prickly subject and it is quite common to hear diatribes against linguistic minorities and those who do not speak the language native to the area they stay in. However, even this problem of communication has been resolved by that great gift of Empire, the English language. If two people from any of the country’s opposite extremes were to converse, they would use the English language to great effect. Indeed, this has even resulted in an amalgamated language called ‘Inglish’ which has created a cultural identity and linguistic space of its own.

Socially too, we are as diverse and it must be said, as divided as ever. Perhaps more so in the present than at any time in the past, near or ancient. India has always had a divided society. The caste system effectively divides us into haves and have-nots, where the have-nots outnumber the haves by a large sum. The have-nots, by virtue of their numbers are at the bottom of the pyramid, and the haves are right on top. This caste based division of society is often reflected in the economic sphere as well. The upper castes are in most cases, very well off. The lower castes tend to be among the poorer and more downtrodden sections of the society. Consequently the aspirations of the haves are vastly different from the aspirations of those at the lower half of the pyramid. This social pyramid has been the template for every society since the beginning of time. The upper classes, the middle classes and the lower classes are at various times dominant separately, but their composition remains pretty much the same. When the aspirations of one of these classes are not met, a society will experience upheaval. In the case of the lower classes, it is revolution. For the others, this upheaval takes the form of a flight to greener pastures. It is this upheaval that India is facing today.

The Indian state in the past sixty years has done a decent, though by no means complete, job of providing for the basic (and here I must stress on the word basic) aspirations of the lower rungs of the pyramid. The Roti, Kapada aur Makaan has been taken care of for many Indians. Food security was achieved quite a while ago, while our housing situation too has not been too bad. Again, I must remind the reader that there is much to be done, but there has been a good deal of coverage in this area. In the case of the better off citizen of this nation, the Roti, Kapada aur Makaan has always been taken care of. It is something else that he aspires too. These aspirations may take the form of entertainment, social standing, a certain lifestyle or even the choice of clothing. It is a matter of debate as to whether these aspirations have been fulfilled or not. Certainly, the cities of India hold all the ingredients to provide for these aspirations. And yet, it is seen that they do not and the urban youth have flocked to greener pastures abroad like migratory wildebeest. The logical conclusion in this case is that the aspirations of the urban youth have changed and these aspirations are something that Indian society cannot fulfill.

And so what are the aspirations of the urban, educated, elite of this nation? Certainly education and employment is readily available. Admission into an IIT/NIT, or barring that, an educational institute of similar standing is within their reach. A degree in Engineering guarantees every one of them gainful employment with a salary that can ensure a comfortable lifestyle. Some of them go in for a post graduate degree or diploma in management or business administration. A resume containing all this can lead to a very comfortable lifestyle with excellent prospects for any young Indian with an eye on his future. And yet, it is not sufficient to ensure that he or she does not take flight to greener pastures? What then, are the greener pastures that they aspire to?

Everyone has heard of the brain drain of the 70’s and 80’s. Educated Indians fled abroad in huge numbers, stymied by the lack of opportunities in this land. It was a great loss yes, but one could understand why they left. India in those days was in a socialist paroxysm. The license-quota-permit Raj that Nehru set up stifled creativity and business enterprise. Jobs were hard to come by in an economy with a ‘Hindu-rate-of-growth’ and as a result doctors, engineers and scientists fled this country for the US, helping to build societies there. Today however, the nation is better poised to provide employment and opportunities to its engineers and doctors. And yet, they continue to leave in droves. What then, are the opportunities that they are looking for?

Nehru tried hard to build a common identity for this nation. Today, nearly fifty years after his death, it is hard to say if he has succeeded or not. There is a political and cultural union called India. There is also a growing population of youth that hardly even identifies itself with this nation and its people and culture anymore. They identify themselves with the West. And it is in search of this identity, that they surge westwards in increasing numbers every year.

When I asked why they wished to leave this nation, I received many replies.. Some are insightful, some well thought out, and some are purely cynical and selfish, though unbeknownst to the person concerned.

One worshipper of the Western way of rational thought spoke in raptures about their technological and industrial prowess and glowingly described their plans to build a magnetically levitated high speed rail system. He noted that his own nation that had fed, housed and educated him for twenty five years was a “backward shithole that did not invent anything of note”, thus conveniently discarding the fact that it took the United States a hundred years to reach where it is now, while India is still suffering from its birth pangs.

A young lady of my acquaintance described India as a selfish, repressed society of bullies who could not be counted upon to elect a capable Prime Minister. She was “sick of the way we use age old methods that cannot be integrated into modern society, Must it be taught to even respect equally?”. She was right, to an extent. But it is doubtful if she would ever find a society that respects equally, where bullying is not tolerated and is not parochial and narrow minded in some sense. It also took all of my self control to keep from reminding her that Donald Trump has been elected to the most powerful office in the world.

The real reason, one that they are loathe to acknowledge, is that they no longer identify with the people around them anymore. Indeed, the vast majority of Indians are invisible to them and when they do make an appearance in their lives, they are disgusted and feel alienated. They would rather not acknowledge the presence of those whose aspirations are to merely survive, than to sit in a bar the whole day and drink beer and discuss the latest happenings in International politics. Fed on a relentless diet of Americana, they do not identify with Indian events, Indian characters, Indian food, drink or even other Indians anymore. The television shows they watch are American. The food that they eat is American. The books they read are American. The language they are most comfortable with is American. The news channels they are most familiar with show local American news. Indeed, they would know more about the political system of the USA than of their own nation.  The latest agendas of the latest Senatorial candidates would be on their fingertips. What would not be on their minds, is the names of their MP’s and MLA’s back home.

One of the most absurd things I have heard of in recent times is the news that a socialist has been elected to the Seattle city council. That a socialist has been elected in the USA itself is absurd enough. But what makes the news even more absurd is the fact that the candidate who campaigned on a socialist platform was an Indian who was raised in India, was educated in India, was in all likelihood a beneficiary of all the post liberalization reforms of the Government of India. Like everyone else in her generation, she would have been the first to demand reforms and the lifting of India’s socialist policies and yet, when she emigrated to the US, rediscovered the socialist in herself, because she could not bear to see the suffering of the American masses under the yoke of capitalism. It reeks of hypocrisy. Would she do the same thing in India? No. In India, the very same candidate would have triumphantly pointed to the benefits of our liberalization and campaigned for a right wing party, merely because the reforms have benefitted her tiny group of elites who reside on the top of the pyramid at the expense of those at the bottom. But of course, they do not even exist for her. Instead, she chose to fight for the American’s Roti, Kapada, aur Makaan, because – “ It is easier to convince 300 million literate people to vote for you, than to convince 1 billion illiterate people, never mind that they are your own people.”. There is a word to describe such people. It is ‘mercenary’. But then, what can you expect of a people who would rather celebrate Halloween to Holi?

It is easier to convince three hundred million literates to vote for you. It is far more difficult for these people to convince the one billion Indians who are their countrymen to vote for them because they do not even speak their language. Indeed, they do not even make an effort to learn their own mothertongue and identify with the rest of their society. This laziness to push themselves and achieve something points to a deeper malaise in our psyche. In other words, this generation of Indians has ‘Aspirations, but no Ambitions’. They feel apart from the world around them and would rather run away to the West than do anything about the very society that gave birth to them, but cannot satisfy their outsize American aspirations. And why would they not? They are Americans in all but name.

"Indigo flight to chandigarh overbooked passengers stranded. So, flight 6E 592 from Bangalore to Chandigarh Indigo airlines has been overbooked by indigo. These guys came to know about this when boarding bus was at the door of aircraft with 50-70 passengers still in boarding bus. 

We have kept the flight stranded for now.

But such irresponsible behaviour from indigo has left all of us in jiffy. We are standing at tarmac currently.

Will update.

Please upvote this for visibility. These are such malicious practices. How can they have overbooked so much.

Update1: so indigo guys scheduled same flight to two different places instead of two. And passengers for other location (I couldn't get that) have not be allowed to board.
Now they have boarded all the Chandigarh passengers.
But rest are still stranded. I am on board but still there are atleast 30 people stranded. This is some pathetic show by indigo

Also I am not sure whether i will get my luggage today.

Okay will update after I reach Chandigarh airplane mode time. Hope these guys don't remain stranded here for long.

Real shit show by indigo

Update 2: Reached Chandigarh got my luggage.

About the whole fiasco. Seems like those passengers were going to Amritsar and Indigo cancelled their flights and tried to put them on Chandigarh flight and a further passage to Amritsar. Now due to almost complete show by Chandigarh passengers ,Amritsar guys were stopped from boarding.
TLDR: seems like indigo miscalculated the no show and caused stranded passengers
 Edit: https://www.flightstats.com/v2/flight-tracker/6E/592

**Big Oil To Get Fatter**

One of the ideas being thrown around to deal with the bad loans crisis was merging all 27 state-owned banks to make 6 really huge banks. Taking inspiration from that idea, the government is now throwing around another idea - [merging](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/government-set-to-start-talks-on-merging-13-state-oil-companies-to-create-behemoth/articleshow/53371857.cms) 13 big state-owned oil companies to make 1 really huge oil company. Companies like ONGC, Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum lead the list of the 13 companies being considered for this mega-merger. Even as oil prices nearly committed suicide last year, just the top 6 state-owned oil companies still managed to report revenues of ₹9.3 trillions. So clearly, the 1 giant oil company that will come out of these mergers will be big enough to rival the likes of UK’s BP and Russia’s Rosneft. But it will still be a few ranks smaller than some of the biggest oil companies in the world. And at least when it comes to business, size does matter. This idea of merging oil companies isn’t a new idea - it’s been brought up and shot down numerous times in the past mainly due to concerns over reduced competition. Mergers are extra difficult for government companies because after every merger, there’s some extra fat that you have to trim. But government companies tend to focus on social welfare before profit - which means keeping that extra fat to pump up employment in the country. Even if the prospect of this 1 giant oil company with trillions in revenue seems huge right now, rest assured, it won’t be bigger than *yo mama*.

**Gone Are The Days Of Jabong**

The e-commerce industry made multiple headlines last week - the biggest story being the acquisition of Jabong. Flipkart-owned Myntra went shopping around for companies and [dropped](https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/25/rocket-internets-jabong-sold-to-flipkart-owned-rival-myntra-for-70m/) $70 million on Jabong, creating the largest online fashion company. The second-highest bidder for Jabong was Snapdeal which offered $50 million followed by Future Group (that owns the Big Bazaar stores) which offered $35 million. It’s been a tough couple of years for Jabong. Even Amazon, the 800-pound gorilla of the e-commerce business, briefly considered acquiring Jabong for $1 billion back in 2014. Compared to that price tag, Flipkart got a nice discount of 93%. However, the days aren’t as rosy as they sound for Flipkart. Exhibit A - the company just [fired](http://profit.ndtv.com/news/start-ups/article-flipkart-to-lay-off-hundreds-of-underperforming-employees-report-1437780) about 700 employees and tried to play it off as “a fairly common practice”. Exhibit B - Industry reports released last week indicate that Amazon has [surpassed](http://www.firstpost.com/business/most-consumers-preferred-amazon-over-flipkart-for-online-transactions-in-2016-says-survey-2915798.html) Flipkart to become India’s preferred online destination. Exhibit C - Snapdeal reached 1 million daily transacting users, more than those of Flipkart and Amazon put together. Seems like bad news does come in threes.

**RIO MMXVI**

The 2016 Olympic Games are set to begin next week in Brazil. As the media begins extensive coverage of the events, get ready for the millions of Indians that will be shocked to find out about the existence of sports other than cricket and fighting trolls online. Just as the international media came at India with pitchforks drawn for botching up the 2010 Commonwealth Games, let’s turn those pitchforks around and poke other countries for mismanaging international sporting events. The host nation, Brazil is going through its worst economic crisis since 1930 and its worst health crisis since 1918. The country’s GDP contracted by 4% in 2015, and is expected to [contract](http://www.pri.org/stories/2016-02-22/budget-rio-olympics-16-times-higher-budget-combat-zika-virus) by another 3% in 2016. Plus there’s the small matter of Zika viruses roaming around giving birth defects to unborn babies. Technically, the country doesn’t have a President since the most recent one was suspended under charges of corruption. Considering all of that, just the fact that Brazil hasn’t descended into anarchy is an achievement. The government has allocated $9.7 billion for the Olympic Games, which is 16 times more than the budget allocated to deal with the Zika virus that has already infected 1.5 million Brazilians. Hashtag Priorities. However, every Olympic Game since 1968 has exceeded its budget by an average of 179% which means that $9.7 billion could very well balloon up to $17 billion. Godspeed Brazil, godspeed.

**News Flash: Old Age Is Tough**

Most people’s idea of preparing for retirement includes investing in 1) Fixed Deposits, 2) Mutual Funds or 3) A kid or two. But a survey by the investment bank HSBC [found](http://zeenews.india.com/business/news/finance/47-indians-not-saving-for-retirement-hsbc_1908299.html) that 47% of the working people in India haven’t even started saving for retirement. No need to panic - the global average is around the same at 46% - so the rest of the world is as deep in this swamp as India. The HSBC survey also found the 80% of Indians seek advice about retirement from friends and family - which basically means that your primary source of information about retirement is that one balding uncle you have who walks around with a beer belly and midlife crisis. That’s just one survey. Here’s another - the annual Global Retirement Index published by Natixis, one of the biggest asset management companies in France, [ranked](http://qz.com/737382/india-is-the-worst-place-in-the-world-to-retire-2/) India as the 43rd best country to retire. That doesn’t seem so bad until you realize that the Index only tracks 43 countries to begin with, and India finished last. Dispelling any notions that India finished last due to all the nice guys in the country, the index mentioned the pitiful state of India’s healthcare system as one of the reasons that we finished last. Meanwhile, Norway and Switzerland were ranked as the best places to retire.

With strong indications that the bill will be supported by all political parties, the GST bill is largely expected to pass this Wednesday. But we’re just getting started. After that, at least half of the states in India need to approve the bill for it to become operational.

"(Mechanical) Engineers, was it worth pursuing a post-graduate in India? Mechanical Engineer here. I graduated in 2018 with good grades from a reputed college in Bangalore. My degree certificate says ""First Class with Distinction"".

But I don't feel like I learned anything in my time as an undergraduate. The faculty were utterly useless and did little to stir interest amongst the students in the subjects they taught. Nor did my professors ever know anything outside their textbooks, even going so far as to preach outright lies because that's how they'd always been doing it for all these years. The only thing I feel like I got out of my experiences in college were all the projects I did. Being a student allowed me participate in 4 racing events. That's all I feel like I reaped from my undergraduate education.

I'm not here to shit on the Indian education system, because I know enough of that is done on the internet. I've been working for a year, and I feel like it's time to pursue a Post Graduate degree. None of the bigger, well paying companies in the mechanical/automobile/aerospace sector really pay any attention to undergraduates anyway, and they usually end up with dead end supervisor roles (or so I'm told).

So should I even bother trying to pursue an Mtech in Mechanical Engineering from an Indian university? I've heard that it isn't worth it unless you get it from an IIT or BITS. Mind you, some people tell me that the teaching there is shit too.

I've started to shift my focus abroad. But I know studying abroad means working abroad to pay off my student loans. I'm not a big fan of that idea, and don't want to spend a significant portion of my youth outside the country. There are a lot of personal reasons behind that. (Don't worry, I'm not forsaking my career for a girl)

Sorry you had to read all that. I'll finally get to my question. Was it worth doing an Mtech (specifically in M.E.) in India? Did you end up getting a good job? If you did it abroad, did you end up spending a long time there? Were you able to pay off your student loans easily?

Of course I know each individual case is different, and it all depends on how well you study. I'm just a little lost and could use some guidance. Thank you!",AskIndia

"What do we do then to make Indian leaders future ready? Being future ready has never been easy, but the storm of information(and technologies) that crop up today is more explosive than any we have ever seen.

Blockchain, Cryptocurrencies, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Renewable Energy, Internet of Things, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, Self-Driving and Electric Vehicles and who knows what else.....

"Sewage workers in India Sewage workers in India suffer from the worst work-environment and we are doing nothing about it. They literally take a dip inside the sewage tanks filled with shit or sewage water to clean the clogged up drains and many die due to the poisonous gas build up inside those tanks. What kind of human would do it to themselves? Believe me, they don't. They drink a lot before and after to avoid the trauma of working in such conditions. And that takes a toll on their financial condition(which is already low) and their family. So, what's the solution? 

There should be a law which prevents man-power to clean sewage drains and tanks. But that's already there in the law! Then what's the hurdle? There's a lack of safety equipments and technical equipments to clean the drains without a man entering the manholes. They do it because there's no other way to do it. And people expect them to do it because almost all sewage workers belong to the scheduled caste. These casteist feelings are present everywhere which alienates their voice for a reform in the system. 

In my opinion, Indian government must spend money on buying advanced sewage equipments and safety equipments and masks. And they should be present in every municipality office, for free. Government should also conduct training programs to teach the sewage workers on how to use those equipments effectively. And the final step is that of citizens, to stop looking at them as the ""untouchables"" and appreciate them as human beings who clean up your shit, so that you don't have to. 

What are your opinions to solve the problem? Kindly give your opinions in the comments",Scheduled

"[SERIOUS] How would people in India react if someone started posting erotic/implied nude photography on Instagram? PS: I’m going to be as specific as possible so people here can actually tell how others, specially my friends, college teachers etc might react. I’ve also added serious tag so that the replies don’t turn into sarcastic/joke types. 

I’m an Indian guy in my mid twenties working abroad. I like to do photography as a hobby in my free time although art of any form but mainly paintings and movies have always been something I’ve been very interested in. Lately I started shooting female portraits which involves mostly European and sometimes Asian women. I post all my work on Instagram where my friends and even teachers from school follow me.

So far my friends and colleagues etc have been really appreciating my photos. Some of them were very impressed since I do feel my photos are good and stand out. Surprisingly I’ve received better feedback from my female friends.

Now I’m thinking of starting erotic/boudoir photography which involves women in very less clothing. Some of that also involves nude women where nudity is implied i.e. breasts hidden by hand etc (no frontal nudity). Something along the lines of playboy shoots. I have couple of shoots already planned with two  European girls.

I’m not someone who cares much about what others think but I’m a bit concerned if this is going to have a bad impact on me in any way that I am unaware of. I mean any way this can have a bad effect. In terms of reputation or how people may react or perceive me etc. I’m especially not sure how Indian people would react to this and if I’m going to be viewed in a negative way.

After all that, my boss tells me for one error, not a critical error, that I was all my work was trash, I was useless and a loser. I mean, he screamed at me for 2 days, so there really is no point going into the details. 

So, I quit. I didn't get angry. But I could not let my hard work get disrespected as much. My boss expected me to fix my error, and continue working as if nothing had happened. 

But now, I wonder. Did I do the right thing?

"Chandrayaan 2 Has Begun Orbiting The Moon - Here is the Journey India's first lunar mission, Chandrayaan-1, was launched in 2008 but it did not land on the Moon. But it did carry out the first and most detailed search for water on the Moon using radars.

Chandrayaan-2 is scheduled to land near the unexplored south pole of the Moon.

This mission focuses on the Moon, to find useful information about water, minerals and measuring moon-quakes.

India used its most powerful rocket, the **Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark III (GSLV Mk-III)**, for this mission. It weighed 640 tonnes (almost 1.5 times the weight of a fully-loaded 747 jumbo jet) and, at 44 meters (144ft), and was as high as a 14-story building. The journey is assumed to be a little more than six weeks, which is a lot longer than the four days the Apollo 11 mission took, 50 years ago, to land humans on the Moon for the first time.

To save fuel, ISRO has chosen an indirect route to benefit off of the Earth's gravity, which will help fasten the satellite towards the Moon. of the Earth's

""There will be 15 terrifying minutes for scientists once the lander is released and is hurled towards the south pole of the Moon,"" ISRO chief K Sivan said before the first launch attempt.

He explained that those who are controlling the spacecraft until it lands the moon will have to sit back and pray because the landing is automated. So, the actual landing would happen only if all the systems performed as they should. Otherwise, the satellite could crash into the surface of the Moon.

"Economics. That is why I support the BJP / NDA. Every second day there is a thread on ""Why do educated people support that fount of communal poison the BJP"". Instead of all of us endlessly circle jerking over subjective stuff, I wanted to take a slightly different approach and put forth some key macro economic indicators that compare data from NDA I era and the UPA I & II regimes. I even plotted graphs on an excel, but imgur won't allow me to upload excel graphs and I have no idea how to upload these onto Reddit otherwise, ideas welcome. Also how does one make tables on Reddit? Copy pasting from excel again does not work.

**The Data** -

Indicator	        NDA	     UPA I	       UPA II
Agriculture    2.78%	    3.07%	       4.10%
Industry	      5.80%	    9.10%       5.10%
Services	      7.60%	    9.90%	      8.09%

On GDP growth rates, nothing much to choose from though the UPA seems to have done well across all sectors, as to how this wa achieved, I will cover it a little later.

Indicator	NDA	UPA I	UPA II
CAD	3.40%	-13.12%	-56.58%

On CAD, the UPA performance looks horrible, one could attribute increasing oil prices (it touched a peak of $ 100 a barrel) to a certain extent, but it is only a portion of why the CAD went down so horribly.
 
Indicator	        NDA	UPA I	UPA II
Inflation WPI	4.58	5.9	         7.08
Inflation CPI	3.86	6.04	10.18

Inflation seems to have been horribly mismanaged by the UPA, and this is largely due to deficit financing and pumping in huge funds into the rural sector in the form of MNREGA. The MNREGA was in the larger picture actually bad for the intended recipients as it drove up prices over and hurt the economy as a whole.

Indicator	       NDA	UPA I	UPA II
Fiscal Deficit	3.8	30.86	76

Again, how did the UPA achieve the funding of such profligate schemes such as MNREGA or the Food Safety Act or the loan waiver? By deficit financing. It essentially spent more (which govts usually do) more than what it earned. This also has the side effect of fueling inflation.

And now we come to why I believe even these numbers are illusionary,

Absolute Increase in Employment (mn)	NDA	UPA
Agriculture	                                              21.25      -15.71
Manufacturing	                                              11.72	-7.23
Non Manufacturing	                                        9.11	26.14
Services	                                                      18.77	-0.48
Total	                                                       60.85	2.72

The net jobs added by the NDA in 10 years as compared to the UPA in 12 (data for 2013 on was not available)  is not even comparable and this is why I believe the UPA growth was an illusory / jobless growth.

Factor in the 10 million unemployed people hitting our workforce every year and it is imperative that as a nation we find jobs for all of them.

Another factor I would have liked to compare but as data is not available prior to 2008 I will leave it out of scope but just mention it. This is the indicator of Gross Fixed Capital Formation in infrastructure. The NDA as well know focussed a lot on infrastructure, roads and the highway network being chief amongst these. The NDA added more roads in 5 years than 30 years of other governments combined. Without the govt massively investing in actual infrastructure, job creation and economic growth is going to be difficult to manage.

This is not new either (the UPA mismanagement), Indira Gandhi did pretty much the same thing. She created an import fueled bubble of illusory growth that broke very quickly and fueled massive inflation. *Windows of Opportunity: Memoirs of an Economic Adviser by Krishnaswamy* goes into detail into how Indira almost wrecked the national economy by recklessly devaluing the currency and sending inflation soaring to 75% in the late 60's. Indira also established the trend of a socialistic economy (not her father, who piloted a Mixed economy) by ruthlessly nationalising every industry from coal to banking to wheat and imposing draconian restrictions on the private sector. Indira ALSO failed to focus on infrastructure, and during her first regime, cut down on investment in infrastructure.

After Nehru who did very well to guide the Indian economy given his set of challenges, every succeeding Gandhi dynast has been an absolute disaster for the national economy. 

The problem is, the Gandhi / Congress way has now caught on and almost every major party follows the same dead approach of populsim, throwing sops during election time and forgetting about even basic economics.

**Subjective opinion**- In BJP I see a party that is serious about building up infrastructure, that is serious about creating jobs, that while populist, marries this populism with a sense of pragmatism. It is arguably the only party right now that sees merit in manufacturing as being the workhorse of the Indian economy. I see how the BJP method has worked (relative to India of course) in places like Chatisgarh, MP, Gujarat, Goa. Yes, it has failed in Karnataka, yet it has the resilience to learn and apply lessons and not just throw up some dynast scion to continue the same tired old politics.

Sloganeering, empty tokenism and sops all won't work without some hard reforms, and this is something the BJP has an established track record in and this is why I support the BJP.

"Can't decide what motorcycle to buy. I'm in the market for a 150+ cc motorcycle, in the the 1.1-1.3 lac range. Took a few test rides. Right off the bat, dealerships are fucking terrible. Out of the 3 dealers I went to, only one let me ride the bike without having one of their boys ride pillion. Two dealers(One Suzuki and one TVS) let me ride only on a small stretch in front of their showroom, and let me ride for barely 200 meters before asking me to return. I asked for a proper test ride but they made up some bullshit about company policy.

Anyway. Here are my options:

1. FZ-S Version 3.0: Very goodlooking and smooth but felt underpowered when I rode it. Doesn't quite pull like a 150 cc should.

2. Apache RTR 160: Have test ridden only the RTR 200 and it felt pretty powerful although a little uncomfortable. Has amazing brakes, one tap and the bike freezes on spot.

3. Pulsar NS 160: Not ridden yet. Heard bad things about Bajaj engine quality. Rear seat doesn't seem to be the most comfortable for female pillions

4. Honda Hornet: Not ridden yet but looks kinda vanilla.

5. Suzuki Gixxer: Engine seems smooth but could've been a little easier on the butt. Heard bad things about their after sales support.

Here is what I need help on. Any one here who owns a bike in this segment (or has ridden it extensively) can chip in with their experiences? Share everything you possibly can that'd help me make a choice.",AskIndia

"[AskIndia] Guidance regarding DTU, NSUT &amp; IGDTU *I have already posted this query on India_Academia but haven't got any reply. *

Hello all, My sister got a 49,000 rank in JEE Mains with Delhi domicile. She has got MAE in IGDTU till Round 1, but hasn't been upgraded till Round 3. Our options below in order of choice filling - 

1) IGDTU - ECE Electronics - I was expecting her to get this till round 3 but haven't till now, so a bit worried

2) NSUT - MPAE Manufacturing Process &amp; Automation Engg - Very difficult to get considering last year cutoffs - may get only after Round 4

3) DTU - MAM Mechanical &amp; Automotive Engg - May not get - high cutoff

4) NSUT - BT Biotechnology - Not a lucrative branch, but I have preferred it over other slightly better or similar branches of DTU because of lesser number of students (= better chance of getting placed)

5) IGDTU - MAE Mechanical &amp; Automation Engg - Allotted

6) DTU - PIE Production &amp; Industrial Engg - All of below branches are almost alike in placement scenario as all of them have very less/poor Core placement options. Students from these branches either go for Software, other Non-core profiles, MBA or MS. 

7) DTU - Civil

8) DTU - EP Engg Physics

9) DTU - Polymer

10) DTU - ENE Environmental Engg

11) DTU - BT Biotechnology

Of late I have been thinking if we should prefer BT, Polymer from DTU (far better college than IG) over MAE (better branch than BT) from IGDTU. I myself am from an IIT but from Civil branch and couldn't get a placement from campus. So I would totally prefer a better branch in place of better college but MAE is not an exceptional branch either. And she won't get IT in IGDTU either. 

Q1. Should I move DTU branches above MAE from IGDTU?

Q2. Considering no. of students, should I keep NSUT BT above DTU branches?

Q3. I have read some post on quora stating that NSUT is better for circuit branches, and DTU is better for rest. How true is that? 

Q4. Is ECE at IGDTU good enough? (if she gets it in further rounds)

Kindly suggest edits to the above order. 


I am looking at a Software profile job after college, so she will study software no matter what branch she gets.",AskIndia

"My suggestions for dealing deal with depression, low confidence, mental health Keep it short: 

Had extremely extremely high social anxiety, 0 confidence, followed by crippling depression. Ideas like I will never be able to earn money etc. Now: social anxiety is so less, its completely crazy.  Almost gone is several cases.

Realize depression, anxiety WILL go away. You are wrong if you think your anxiety can't go away or you won't be confident. Same with depression, curable. Get this in your head.

Things that actually really worked with me:

1. Sunlight! My psychiatrist told me. 1 hr daily. Direct sunlight on your head, neck areas, ideally within 3 hrs on waking. He also suggested about an option of buying some lights that do the same thing.
2. Sleep schedule is very important !! Cannot be stressed enough. Something I ignored for years! Even now its not perfect. But wake early after 7-8 hrs of sleep. Wake at 6AM, go outside in the morning breeze.
3. Exercise. Strength exercise specifically. At least for me. Its not about muscles. Your body, you, feel different. I didn't know back muscles could be flexed. Don't attempt to rush it though. Make it a medium term plan to become physically stronger. Start slow, stretch, jog, walk. Avoid injuries. took 4-5 months to feel results. 

Confidence is not magic. Nor is depression a mystery. Think scientifically. Human body has evolved for millions of years in a certain environment - with open areas, lot of sunlight, doing hard labour. In the absence of sunlight, living in a cave with a weak body, our body is in unknown waters. Issues are bound to happen imo.",Scheduled

"[Serious]Messed up real bad,need some advice I'm currently doing engineering under vtu in karnataka.I chose it out of my own interest as i really love computer science.But first year was really difficult for me,due to which I got a year back,because i fucked up in theoretical subjects(I really find them difficult,main reason i choose engineering was to avoid them).Failed in 6,got a year back,as i mentioned,somehow survived it,got back to college by clearing 4 out of my 6 backs(from first year),carried 2 along.Our university has this shitty rule which says that you cannot enter 3rd year until you clear first year backs.Even though I've cleared most of my 2nd,3rd and 4th semester subjects(couldn't clear a few because of back to back exams),i don't think i'll be able to go to the next semester(i'm in 4th sem rn,my exams are almost over) because i don't think i'll be able to clear one of those 2 first year backs and will probably get another year back,feeling confused and frustrated af,what should i do??I'm also feeling guilty as I had promised them to study well and do MS abroad because that's what they wanted me to do since most of my cousins did.I'm finding it really difficult to live with myself and feel like comitting suicide every day.

"I think I got a road fixed via Twitter I live near Delhi University North campus. The road in front of Ramjas College was dug up by Jal Board many months ago. Since then it was a mess of rocks and dust and the whole area was heavily polluted because of all the dust that blew up because people continued driving on the dirt road. 

On 29th June I tweeted PWD this: https://twitter.com/pratikarora/status/1144834202996637696

They responded with a complaint number which they have since removed (don't know why).

Yesterday while driving in that direction I noticed that the road was barricaded on both sides. Today they confirmed by replying to the original tweet that repair work is underway. https://twitter.com/DelhiPwd/status/1154693436538150912",Non-Political

"What is NPR? How does it affect you? NPR is first step of the National Register of Indian Citizens, which is the other name of nation-wide NRC. NPR is a collation of all ‘usual residents’ living in India. Under the Citizenship Rules, 2003, a National Register of Indian Citizens is to be produced after filtering citizens from non-citizens. 

How is this filtering done?

First a local officer “verifies” the list & issues notice to “doubtful citizens” from list of local residents. These “doubtfuls” must now prove their citizenship. Following this, a draft list is published.
If you think your inclusion in the draft list is enough, it’s not, because the rules permit objections to the inclusion of any name on the list. Presumably, anyone can file an objection. The decision of your Indianness is made by an officer.

NPR also collects sensitive personal information of every Indian, including passport details (~5.5% of Indians have passports). 

Source : https://twitter.com/asadowaisi/status/1209158963603755011

Back-end for NRC already seems to be ready, see the login page, here http://lsi.gov.in/srs/nric/loginnric.aspx ([source](https://twitter.com/DilliDurAst/status/1209385926251540480))

Also, All-India NRC and CAA are both part of the same law, the Citizenship Act, added by Vajpayee-Advani in 2003 and Modi-Shah in 2019, respectively. [Vajpayee-Advani imagined an all-India NRC and Modi-Shah added a Muslim filter](https://theprint.in/opinion/vajpayee-advani-imagined-an-all-india-nrc-and-modi-shah-added-a-muslim-filter/339366/)

> As per the 2003 amendment, the Indian government shall count all its citizens and create a National Population Register or NPR. The government will then verify the citizenship of the people counted. Once it does, the verified citizens will become part of another document, the “National Register of Indian Citizens”.

[Union cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, approves over Rs 8500 crore for updating National Population Register](https://twitter.com/PTI_News/status/1209401270605209600)

Note that the NPR will be carried out alongside the Census -- so most people will be confused, thinking it is the census rather than first step of the NRC.

"So this happened with my food delivery Today I ordered some food from swiggy. Order status was showing Delivery executive collected food and is on the way but from tracking his bike was showing off the route and it got delayed by 10-15 min so I called executive and he said he is on the way and will meet me in 2 min my apartment gate. I thought maybe some GPS tracking issue.

I went to gate to collect but he did not show up, so I called him and he again said within 2 min he will be there.

Finally he delivered food, When I checked gravy I found quantity was less than usual (50%). Also some gravy was over the package. I immediately felt something is fishy. I suspect that he took away some part of food.

I opened app and checked for help but to my surprise order status was still not showing delivered. I could not report the case.

After waiting for while I cancelled order from my end to get refund and got 100% back.

I was waiting for call from the delivery guy or swiggy but there is no call so far (more than hour now).

I dont think swiggy is at fault here and I am also not 100% sure with my suspicion. 

What do you think of it guys ?

TLDR : Order got delivered late, I suspect food was taken away, No confirmation of order deliverey, had to cancel myself despite receiving package. Got refund but feel something is fishy.",Food

"Get ready for a huge surge of Muslimophobia and Hindu nationalism after/during this lockdown I'll be straighforward: our country already has a lot of Muslimophobia (I am not gonna say Islamophobia because hating Islam as in ideology shouldn't be treated as a bad thing. Treating Muslims badly because you hate Islam, on the other hand, should be bad) and Hindu nationalism is evidently on the rise. Even though at first thought, it might seem that coronavirus may not affect the rate at which these two are growing, it is going to affect it in a huge way. 

The biggest blunder has to be the Tablighi Jamat. Out of 3000+ cases, 1000+ cases (more than 33% of the cases) has been linked to the Jamat. Among the rest, if you just see the initial list of dead people from corona, you will see a lot of them (if not most) had visited Saudi Arabia or other Muslim countries. As you might know, Muslims are already blamed for almost every historic and bad events. There is a huge chance that the entire coronavirus epidemic in India maybe said to be 'brought by Muslims to harm Hindus'. The number of fake news which tries to show that Muslims are deliberately trying to harm Hindus is already bad.

Unfortunately for Muslims, during this crisis when they were already being alienated by CAA-NRC, Jamat has been responsible for the steep rise in cases. Not that Hindus or other religions did not do something like that - Hindus got together in Vaishno Devi, they got together in many festivals, they got together during gaumutra party, they got together for 'thali bajaa'ing. But there has been no cases linked to any of those events. It might be that there are coronavirus carriers and cases among them, but since it isn't testable and observable, we cannot make any definite statement, it won't be scientific.

To make things worse, if we somehow get through this nightmarish pandemic, remember Modi will get all the credit. People will say that ""Modi handled the pandemic in India well"". This might even increase his approval rate among common people. Not to mention that if the apparent growth rate of cases in India remains slower than other countries, as it currently is, it might increase people's faith in the  superiority of India. People might say ""Look at those immoral westerners. They have been punished for their immoral lifestyle by karma. That is why India, such a holy land, hasn't been greatly affected by it apart from those Muslims and Chinese who brought that disease to India!"". This narrative might gain a lot of attention. Never underestimate the power of fake news, ethnonationalism, authoritarianism and racism.",Coronavirus

"[Rant] India’s BRUTAL tax for the rich To be honest, I feel this post applies to those who pay tax (regardless of which slab), I’m just putting stuff from my perspective.

There are no two ways to put it, India’s tax on the super rich is ridiculously high. I belong to that super rich community and while paying taxes is not an issue, the amount certainly is. Money doesn’t come easy and I’ve worked hard for it. Meanwhile the government just gives us a big middle finger and increases the taxes. 

Now tell me why would anyone want to live in a developing country with such high tax rates. Before any of you’ll hark on about patriotism and bullshit like that just think logically for a second. For the amount of tax (42.7%) paid here, you can easily shift to a country with lower tax rates. And with the kind of money people from my income category have I can see a lot of them leaving this country for good. 

The government is not incentivizing individuals to become wealthy. What benefits does being wealthy in India get you? Roads are shit, public infrastructure is lacking, incredibly high taxes for luxury items, the list goes on and on.... 
Instead they want to spend my money on statues, stupid ministries like AYUSH, scams, bailing out public sector companies and stuff like that.

Worse, so much money, which I GAVE as tax is being spent to appease the vote bank. Rich farmers are not taxed because the government is afraid to lose them. The individuals and companies who pay taxes (the 1%) have absolutely no say in policies because the government wants to use the money to appease the other (99%). (The figures are just examples). We are the source of that money. India is taking a turn to the socialist era, when taxes were even more exorbitant and India was a planned economy. I just wish the government would aggressively try to increase the tax base instead of strangling those who pay tax.

EDIT- I am NOT averse to paying high taxes in general. I already elaborated that in my comment below but in India, tax does not give benefits that other countries with similar tax rates give.",Policy/Economy

To,  
*The Hon'ble Ex-Chancellor, Jadavpur University.*   
SUBJECT: **Letter of Rustication to Kindly Terminate your Hon'ble Services Effective Immediately.**   
Sir,  
It has come to the attention of the general students of Jadavpur University that you were present on the premises of Jadavpur University in the evening of 19.9.2019, along with miscreants who hurled bombs, sexually assaulted women and vandalized sections of the university. Furthermore, you arrived uninvited to Jadavpur University on 22.12.2019. We have investigated your behavior and motives and come to the conclusion that they are shameless attempts to seek attention from students, thereby wasting our valuable time.   
Furthermore, on 23.12.2019, as part of the ongoing evaluation of university officials by students, you were asked a number of questions about the NRC, NPR, CAA; the SC/ ST Commission, violence unleashed on Muslim and other students and so on. We have found your responses to these questions unsatisfactory. They were as innocent of knowledge about BJP led police brutality on Muslim and other students as you are innocent of integrity. Academically speaking, your thesis holds no water and your defense is weak. Moreover, the students are convinced that your decision to stir up violence against students at Jadavpur University follows the party line of the Bharatiya Janata Party. We regret to inform you that we cannot attest to an unblemished record in your character certificate either.   
Keeping the above in mind, you are being informed of your rustication from the position of Chancellor of Jadavpur University. The students' body of Jadavpur University has also decided to disown you from the position of the Hon'ble Governor of West Bengal.   
**Your report card has been attached for your benefit.**   
**General Knowledge**: Less than satisfactory   
**Argumentative capability**: Poor   
**Sense of history**: Nil   
**Strengths**: Unwavering dedication to ignoring violence against students, activists and Muslims.   
**Overall character**: Spineless

"MS Dhoni is most overrated indian player of all time MS Dhoni got lucky with great indian teammates who won the worldcup. He wasn't best indian team captain but he was captain of best Indian team(at WC winning).He got great cult following who are blind to see anything that looks bad on him so because of that Media sings his great endeavour all Time because criticism him would be bad for business. This why he got so strong in board that he basically do whatever the fuck he likes (you can't ignore some of the team selection which are done after 2011, *Gambhir*). He basically IS team selector and nobody wants to say anything because he is too powerful. Everybody is on his side in board. His performance is shit in last  two years(i think he should have retired somewhere around 2017)but still he makes every single cut. His performance in world cup 2019 is shit but nobody speaking anything because he may retire after worldcup and why risk it all to make a point and become target of internet mob(kudos to Sachin for criticizing him) 

He is gotten to a point where will do anything and get a free pass( just imagine any player doing that tantrums which dhoni  did in IPL when he was losing)

Everybody keep saying that he is so cool but it's rather contrary he basically just don't give a shit. Look at any other captain after losing important match you will find similarly but Dhoni's case you won't. 

It is basically every aspect of his career he do anything that doesn't look good on him people will turn it into a his skill ( i have literally seen video where some people dubbed his voice so it look like he isn't swearing at Manish Pandey ( i get it . people swear all the time and things get competitive in sports, but why sugar coat it to make him larger than life character)


He is great wicket keeper and has a good track record untill 2016. But i think power got in his head.

"My experience at Anti CAA-NRC protest in San Francisco outside Indian consulate <throwaway account>    


So a protest was organized in San Francisco outside the Indian Consulate on 26th January against CAA,NRC and NPR. More than 400 people showed up but to our surprise the consulate was ready for protestors. They had made a small area with barricades around their building and hosted 25-30 people with pro-CAA placards. The people who were called by the consulate were highly abusive and provocative. The placards they were holding had words like ch\*\*tiya, pigs, calling us terrorists etc. They were also given a sound system to undermine our voices. It just broke my heart to see that these consulate people stooped to such low level.

These people would occasionally come out and enter anti CAA protestors and shouted Jai Shree Ram and hurled slurs at muslim people, called everyone Pakistani and went back to consulate premises.

Here's the link to some of the pictures.

"DO and DONT of flight travel ( Due to increase in flight anxiety threads and for future if anyone wants reference) Mods kindly make a thread for it. Copy paste this content if you like. Flights are a bit of serious business and I can understand why youngsters might feel incredibly anxious 

Some important things to keep in mind first - 

1. Your flight ticket has to be shown to security outside and check in counter. It can be printed as well as shown from mobile ( Avoid taking screenshot of website from where you confirmed your ticket. Take the PDF/JPG which you get via mail from the site. )

2. All domestic flights have a STRICT 45 min closure of check in before their scheduled departure. So make sure that you reach AT LEAST 1.5 hours before your flight. In case you are reaching 1 hour before ( hurt shy of 15 mins for check in closure), kindly INFORM the personnel there that your flight is of that time. Often, they will start to call you themselves by saying FLIGHT TO XYZ area, anyone there. But to be on safe side, do ask personnel there.

3. Airports are supposed to be one of the best and most organized places of any city. So you can expect that there will be proper signboards to guide you.


DO- 1. Keep your power bank inside your handbag and your other stuff like knives,scissors,liquid greater than 100ml inside the check in baggage. 

2. Keep.your power bank, chargers, laptop in your hand baggage. 

3. General weight limit for domestic is 15 kg in check in and 7 in Hand baggage. 

4. In any doubt, ASK the personnel at airport, especially the airline you have booked. Like if you have booked Air India or something, ASK them any doubt. Remember, they are there to help you only.



DONT - 1. DO NOT PANIC during security check. It is simple. You need to keep your belts, chargers, wallets, watch, mobile and laptops etc in one tray and your bag in other tray. Don't worry, the army personnel there just look scary. They are, in fact, VERY helpful. 

2. Ok this is a common mistake women do. Your bags are Pandora boxes. Often you women go in security check and VOILA, you have scissors, knives ( MULTIPLE) and 2-3 bottles coming out of your bag. Remember all those items are broken there as they can't be taken in flight and you can't do anything for sharp objects. And you have to discard liquid if your bottle is filled and js more than 100ml. So kindly CHECK YOUR HAND BAGS BEFORE LEAVING FOR AIRPORT. 

3. DO NOT abuse the airline members for any delays which are not their fault. Remember they are mostly doing everything they can to solve your problem. And if they can't, chances are you were the reason ( Like you coming 40 mins before flight and check in is closed.) Don't be the guy who screams - I KNOW YOUR MANAGER/MAALIK/OWNER/DAD etc. 

4. DO NOT worry that you will crash lol. Many people who are travelling for first time may be scared. I don't blame them as flight crashes are always big news.

However rest assured because the chances that you will get into a car accident is HIGHER compared to you getting in flight accident. Seriously. It is THAT safe.

If I remember more stuff, I will mention it here. Others also please combine and add stuff which I may have forgotten. I am a busy man",Scheduled

"How Indians enjoy a national team game on Cricket World Cup? Hello Indian friends!

&amp;#x200B;

Im Brazilian, and always loved sports. I use to watch everything broadcasted on TV. But almost no one here knows nothing about cricket, I would say most part of Brazilian dont even know what cricket actually is, and just a few could understand the rules. Because of the current World Cup, for the first time I tried to understand how a cricket game goes on, and I really liked it. I think cricket is a funny game, and I liked the tension and strategy involving it.  Anyway, I dont imagined before that game's are so long, this is weird for Latin Americans, who basically follow just football. 

&amp;#x200B;

As India is famous to be one of the most passionate cricket countries, I started ask myself, how Indians enjoy a national team game on World Cup?

&amp;#x200B;

I mean, in Brazil, FIFA World Cup is a really massive moment. If national team plays on a morning or afternoon on our local time, almost all the schools and workplaces will not open on this period and basically everyone will be watching the game. Not everyone likes ""regular"" football, but almost everyone gets involved with football in World Cup. You can even hear people's reaction on the game from your window. By two hours, the whole country just stops to watch it, and I think this is normal on all other ""footballing"" nations.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I think stop a country by eight hours for a sports event is maybe not possible. I'm wrong? How the country lives a India game day on World Cup? Also, football fans use to watch almost every FIFA WC game, even the ones that Brazil doesnt play. How cricket fans live World Cup? And about people who are not regular cricket fans, how excited they get on World Cup?",Sports

"#PrivacySupreme: Two years of the Right to Privacy. &amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/dbfff8lv7di31.png

Today marks the second year anniversary of a momentous day in constitutional history in the digital day and age. On August 24, 2017, the Right to Privacy was identified as a fundamental right under the Constitution of India by a nine judge bench of the Supreme Court. The declaration of privacy as a right has had manifold impact not only affecting direct issues of data protection but even larger areas of mass surveillance and personal aspect such as the right to one's own sexuality.

The Right to Privacy is very close to our hearts, it has been one of IFF's core issues and we have consistently been working to ensure the same for citizens of India.  Our fight for privacy has persisted since the introduction of the Draft Personal Data Protection Bill, 2018 with submissions to public consultations, RTIs requesting transparency and disclosure, advocating for privacy through intrusive government schemes such as CCTVs and facial recognition systems and most recently, the tabling of the Personal Data and Information Privacy Code, 2019 in the Lok Sabha aided by the wonderful Dr. Ravi Kumar (Lok Sabha, MP from Tamil Nadu). This is only the beginning.

We will work with all institutions of governance and also continue to challenge them to do better, to continue to work towards ensuring an individual's right to privacy is put first and foremost.

In light of this journey as country, IFF due to the partnership and support of Mozilla will celebrate today with an event that will feature talks and a conversation with Justice B.N. Srikrishna. This will be to the benefit to a cross section of stakeholders and we hope bring varied perspectives such as on gender and criminal justice that are an integral parcel of privacy right. Since seating and space has been limited we are video recording this event and will post it online soon.

We are also encouraging a wider community today to mark, celebrate on what privacy means to them by posting on social media. We have created a document with a few tweets on privacy [at this link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iYlIC7Pv8TxkIm3tKXv1DqyHvSWPsMVf-OcQRJydb7s/edit?usp=sharing) for you tweet out personally. If you feel like it please do consider tagging it with #PrivacySupreme.

Thank you!

If you support the Right to Privacy, help us support you. [***Become an IFF member today***](https://internetfreedom.in/donate/)***!***",Policy/Economy

"[Question] What do you think about teachers? And schools in general. Don't know if you can relate to this. I just wanna try ...

When you're in class, does the teacher ever do this thing where they explain you something simple and mundane with a lot of passion and care, but rush through the genuinely hard concepts?

This is just something I never talked about. I'm in college and working so I don't interact with teachers at all. But I remember a few years ago in class 10/11, the Physics teacher spent like 30 minutes explaining how electromagnetic induction works, but then while solving some equation he all of sudden introduced the concept of definite integrals. I immediately asked him what that was, to which he did some funky hand waiving, implying it was not something worth worring about.

There are many more examples that I can say, but my point is that, teachers waste a lot of time telling us things that are obvious, things which don't need too much explanation because it's already found in our textbooks. But anything that's not in the book, like some new word or idea (I can usually tell what topic the teacher will be unwilling to expand on), or something that seems to invite private engagement (ahem, private tuition), they will ignore, as if even talking about that is a moral sin.

There's another thing I always wanted to ask you. When you were in school, did you have music periods and ""games"" period, which were essentially free periods? In my life, in 12 years they taught the students nothing about music. But on the fees book, the payment was divided into columns made for music and games and craft etc. We never got to do any of those things. But that's just my story. It probably is not the case in most schools.

So how do feel about our education and the people assigned to guide the youth of India?",AskIndia

"Hinduism, conversion and the neutrality of the Indian Secular State: a non-political, theological exploration tl;dr:

* Pagan traditions and Semitic religions are fundamentally different manifestations of religiosity. 

*  Traditions are difficult to proselytize because they do not consider other traditions as false. 

* Semitic religions believe that some religions are indeed false and so encourage and facilitate conversion. 

* The Indian state sees Hinduism as just another semitic religion. 

* The Indian state by allowing conversion is working within a Christian theological framework. It is not being neutral.  



Full length:

In India, we have two different kinds of religions: Pagan or Dharmic or Indic traditions (Hindu, Jain and Buddhist traditions) and Semitic or Abrahamic religions (Islam and Christianity). 

Hindu traditions exist because they are passed down from one generation to the other. Such traditions do not actively seek converts because they do not entertain the notion that other people follow false gods or have false religions. 

Such traditions see things like devas or puja pr bhakti as familial or traditional practices. They are followed in order to maintain some continuity between different generations, not because they contain some grand and timeless truth. The practioners of such traditions might try to justify their actions (a Durga bhakt would say that she is worshiped because she killed a powerful demon).  Such justifications are mostly offered to outsiders (non-bhakts or non-hindus) and are not theologically consistent. 

Observing ancestral practices need not be justified logically just as there is nothing logical about writing a sonnet using just 14 lines. Why 14? Its just tradition. There is nothing scientific or logical about it. 

 Semitic religions (namely Islam and Christianity) spread partly as ancestral practices and partly through conversion.

 Islamic and Christian theologians try (not always successfully of course) to be logically consistent because they  think that they are after some grand and timeless truth. Using the God-given faculty of Reason, they want to understand the nature of Creation and the Creator. Conversion makes sense to Muslims and Christians because they think there are false religions and false gods. And the people who worship such false gods will be punished after they die by the True God. To save the “heathen”, Muslims and Christians are encouraged to engage in proselytization and conversion. 

The heathen needs to be saved from his own spiritual blindness.
 

Indian secularism is defined as equal respect and equidistance from all religions. The secular state sees Hinduism as just another Semitic religion with an internally consistent theology containing a singular grand Truth. So a Brahmin is just another kind of Priest, and Gita another kind of “religious” text like the Quran. Having confused tradition with religion, the Indian state allows for proselytization thinking that it is possible to convert people from one tradition to the other. 


By allowing proselytization and conversion, the Indian state has accepted that:

1.	There are some True gods and some False  gods.
2.	It is possible and necessary and understandable that people can be “saved” from eternal damnation for worshiping false gods. 
3.	Hindu traditions can compete financially and theologically in the “marketplace of damned souls” on a level footing with Islam and Christianity.
  
None of the above statements holds up to  **neutral scientific scrutiny** . Do humans have souls? Can souls be damned? Are there True and False gods? Do Islam and Christianity contain some timeless truth? 

Within the framework of Hindu “theology”, the notions that there are false gods and that you can be punished for worshiping such goads do not make sense.

However, all of the above statements make sense within the framework of Christian theology. 

Faced with two completely contradictory theoretical positions (there are some false gods and there are no false gods), the Indian state cannot be neutral. It either allows conversion (as it has done for the past 60yrs) and accepts the semitic notion of false gods, heathens etc or it bans conversion and gives undue advantage to pagan traditions. 

Faced with two very different kinds of religions, the Indian state cannot afford to be equidistant or show equal respect.

"The 5 step-game of NPR+NRC+CAA NRP - NRC -CAA is the same thing, Don't be confused by all these names, This is just to confuse the common man.

# First Step - CENSUS [aka NPR]

Some govt. officials will visit your place and will ask you the following questions

1. Your name
2. Your Date of Birth
3. Your parent's name and place of birth
4. Some sort of paper just to confirm your identity, ""NOTHING RELATED TO YOUR CITIZENSHIP"" such as maybe your Aadhar number, Voter ID card.

# Second Step - The D factor [Doubtful Citizen]

After a few months, all the data from NPR will be collected and some Government officials will check the whole list and if you weren't able to answer a few questions such as - Your Parent's exact age, their DoB, your own Aadhar number just because it's been month you applied and haven't received it or any other reason not mentioned here then that official will simply put a ""D"" in front of your name i.e. Doubtful Citizen.

# Third Step - NRC

If your name is in the new filtered list of Doubtful Citizens then you will have to ""Prove your Citizenship""

How?

The government has not published any such guidelines as per now but we can understand from the example of Assam: Aadhar Card, Name in the Voter list, name in Ration card list can nothing prove your Citizenship, It was also said by Amit Shah repeatedly in his speeches and interviews recently.

Source: [https://www.siasat.com/aadhaar-voter-id-passport-not-proof-citizenship-govt-1769667/](https://www.siasat.com/aadhaar-voter-id-passport-not-proof-citizenship-govt-1769667/) \[The link also has a video interview, Just in case if you like watching his face and listening to his voice, otherwise believe me and read further\]

You will have to present documents which should prove where you were born 30 years ago if you were not born then you will have to show the documents of your parents or grandparents, any property documents maybe. If you are able to provide the proofs then you are safe, If not then you will be filtered out once again, Hence the 4th step.

# Fourth Step - Foreigners Tribunal

This will be your last chance to prove that you are Citizen of  Bangladesh, Pakistan or Afghanistan, If you are Muslim then you stand no chance because CAA will be activated here even if you prove that you were a citizen of any of the above countries. If others are not able to prove their Citizenship then they will also be labeled as Foreigners.

# Fifth Step - Detention Centers [JAIL FOR FOREIGNERS]

6 detention centers are already functioning in Assam, Constructions of detention Centers has already begun in other states.

**~~\[NSFW\]~~**  I typed a long paragraph about the life in the Detention Center but then  I realized that you guys like Truth but do not the BRUTAL HONESTY. So let's skip that part.

# How to stop this 5-step plan?

It's VERY SIMPLE, As soon the government begins with the first step we need to boycott it immediately because once people are filtered out then it will be too easy for the government to handle us because then they have to handle only a few of use and they exactly know which one of us.

You are not alone, ""We the people of India"" is a group formed by more than 120 organizations throughout the country has given a call to boycott the NPR \[Press release attached at the end\]

How to boycott this process:

If officials visit your place then don't be angry on them, They are not Sanghi (some of them might be), They are the government officials who will be doing this government survey, Offer them water, tea, ask them to even have a seat if you would like that but just politely tell them that you won't be sharing any details with them as it is unconstitutional, Don't give any papers, Don't share any information with them verbally. They will try to tell you that it's a Government survey and it's unconstitutional but take a stand and deny the information politely.

Now I know very well that a lot of my fellow Hindu brothers and ~~sisters~~ females might be thinking that I will give them the papers because mom-dad will yell at me but yeah I will stand against this CAA and NPR during protests, I will go to Shaheen Bagh, No way. It won't work that way, The government will start picking up people one by one after that because just for an example If 1000 people are living in a locality then 770 might show papers then they have to handle only 30 people now, They very well know how to handle 30 people.

I am leaving a video in the comments sections, The same concept explained in Hindi by Yogendra Yadav, share that video with your Driver, Servant, Vegetable Vendor or anyone you know might not have the papers despite caring about their religion. It might change someone's perspective.

"Lifecycle of Indian Male Day 1 – You are born. Parents are celebrating that you are male and even more happier if you have fair skin.

&#x200B;

Childhood – You are expected to go with the flow. You begin to learn the ins and outs of Indian society. Everything can be bargained for in the market and wild animals are everywhere. Creativity, loners, and independent thinking are frowned upon. If you get bullied, **IT’S YOUR FAULT FOR BEING DIFFERENT**. Anything bad that happens (poor eyesight, too short, too fat, etc.) is also **YOUR FAULT**.

&#x200B;

More Childhood – Your parents educate you on your background/culture and how it is the best in the world. In public, your family act friendly with everyone but in private they may make comments ranging from politically incorrect jokes to straight up racist statements. But it’s okay **BECAUSE YOU’RE SPECIFIC CULTURE IS THE BEST**.

&#x200B;

Teenage – The only thing that matters are grades at this point. Sports? Not for you. Music? Weak hobby. Art? That’s for transgenders. Comparisons begin with sharma ji’s beta. Pretty soon, you realize school is not about learning but regurgitating information in a short amount of time. Many people get good grades but few have any curiosity and even fewer learn good civic sense. Teachers are abusive but it’s **YOUR FAULT** because **ELDERS CAN NEVER BE WRONG**.

&#x200B;

More Teenage – You somehow get into college. Only options are medicine or engineering, otherwise you are out of the family because no one will marry you. You also realize that your parents don’t really love each other and try to emotionally blackmail you because you are the only reason they are together. Girls are to be avoided because they only want sex and are a distraction. Everyone (friends, families, distant relatives, neighbors) is in your business because **NOTHING IS PRIVATE**. You are responsible for family honor.

&#x200B;

Studenthood – You go to college. You meet many indoctrinated kids but join the crowd because who are you. You (or at least me) grew up with few female interactions and fail miserably at getting a girlfriend because you are too shy. By the time you get your act together, you are 22. At least you made some good mates.

&#x200B;

Adulthood – You become an Engineer or Doctor **BECAUSE EVERYONE DOES IT**. You probably get a job. A high paying job. It doesn’t matter how much you work, what you do, or if you enjoy it because only **MONEY MATTERS**. If you don’t get a job, it is your fault because you weren’t competitive in the rat race.

&#x200B;

Now you are expected to marry a women significantly younger than you, from a (very) similar background, is fair, very educated but also a housewife. **TROPHY WIFE**. You will be expected to live with your parents who will control your adult life just like their parents did to them. Your new goal is to get to America/Canada/UK **BECAUSE INDIANS BRING THE BEST CULTURE**. Even if you don’t make it, anyone who you know does is automatically a good friend that lives abroad.

&#x200B;

"B.Tech. student with absolutely no idea what to do next...Need advice.. I am a 4th year [B.Tech](https://B.Tech). computer science student from Kerala. I study in a well reputed college and have been scoring good marks ( 84% as of now, 8.4 CGPA) throughout my course although my scores seems to be dropping semester after semester.

I went for engineering coaching and got really interested to take it mainly because I wasn't exposed to any other streams other than engineering and medicine. So I took Computer Science as my degree because I had a faint interest in it and it had a lot of job opportunities. 

But since my second year I started hating computer science, every aspect of it. I know many like it but it's just a no-go for me. I tried many fields like Block chain, Web Designing (had a little interest, the coding part ruined it), Machine learning, IoT, etc. but nothing sparks any interest in me. Now, just hearing the fact that I have to do the project and seminar for next year just brings me pain.

Now I have no idea what to do. There are campus placements in my college the coming year and I don't think I can pass them in the case of interviews or logical questioning as I am really bad at coding and most theory parts. And even if I pass, I don't think I will be interested in the work too.

I have a lot of interest in studying architecture and anything that ignites the creative spark in me(which Computer science doesn't). I am interested a lot in Photography (I take good photos too) and Graphic Design as well. But the career scope in these are very small compared to computer science. Also I have no idea how to develop these skills to a career/professional level one without committing to them, which in turn waste my time on studies and computer science.

What should I do?  Do I continue with computer science till I get an interest in it (which I don't think I will) or should I change my whole career to something else that I am interested in??

EDIT: I know changing careers would be a huge task and risk for me so I am trying my best to find a suitable field for me in computer science itself. Changing careers is like my last resort and I wouldn't do it unless I really want to.

"Vegetarianism in India has more to do with caste hierarchy than love for animals 
Why do vegetarians in India prefer social distance from non-vegetarians? A look at caste-wise food preferences could provide some insights. As is common knowledge, the ranking of castes is mostly influenced by purity of occupation and diet. In caste-society, to achieve purity of body and spirit, it is necessary to be a vegetarian and religious simultaneously – something best embodied by a Brahmin.

The percentage of non-vegetarians among Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, both for men and women, is much higher than among those who are not from these communities. And in the latter group, the highest incidence of vegetarianism is found among Brahmins at almost over 50%. The higher the caste, the greater the possibility of them being pure vegetarians.

The burden of diet-purity and vegetarianism is, however, more on women than men.

Broadly, present-day vegetarianism in India constitutes a form of moral power of minority within Hindus, with such a power being forced on the non-vegetarian majority – with their consent. This new sociality is a sign of progress in modern caste belief where the seductive power of vegetarianism and its associated purity travels seamlessly across bodies and spaces without dissent.

How fragile must the morals of the vegetarian castes be if they feel threatened by the introduction of eggs for poor children in schools? The morals of Indian vegetarians continue to be based less on compassion for humans and animals, and more driven by ideas of hierarchy and purity. In this scheme of hierarchy, one who eats beef is placed at the lowest rung. Like humans of caste, not all animals carry equal sympathy: there exists some hierarchy where the cow (indigenous, not jersey) takes the highest sacral form compared to the rest. Gandhi improvised his vegetarianism through inflicting violence and control on the self. Present-day caste-subjects and their vegetarianism, however, thrive on violence, both on the self and others. The state across India through various governments has mostly been party to this process, promoting the hegemony of misguided vegetarianism.",Scheduled

I've already posted on r/suggestalaptop but didn't get any response. 

I'm looking for a laptop for video editing and maybe some casual gaming. My budget is capped at ₹70000. Below is the form I filled on another subreddit.

Before I put the form in here, Laptops in India are hell lot of expensive. What costs around \~$800 in US is sold here at \~$1100 at least. On an average they cost about 40% higher here in India than the US counterpart.   
for instance: Apple MacBook Pro 15"" with 2.6 GHz i7 (9th gen) costs \~$3650 here.

So you get the point.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, AMDs are seen less in Indian market for ""who knows"" what reasons. There are only Ryzen 5 2500U, 3550H and a Ryzen 3. No Ryzen 7.

OK enough. I'm sorry.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the form:

&amp;#x200B;

\* \*\*Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications for the money? Pick or include any that apply.\*\*  

Not a fan of 2 in 1 form factor, good enough battery life maybe 3-4 hours of real world usage is enough. Best performance for  the money.  I don't want to rush for specs but performance.

&amp;#x200B;

\* \*\*How important is weight and thinness to you?\*\*  

4 on scale of 10

&amp;#x200B;

\* \*\*Which OS do you require? Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Linux.\*\* 

Linux preferably or Windows.

&amp;#x200B;

\* \*\*Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.\*\*   

anything bigger than 15""  

&amp;#x200B;

\* \*\*Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.\*\*  

Softwares:

Adobe Photoshop CS 6

DaVinci Resolve 16

&amp;#x200B;

Games:

Far Cry 5, COD WW, Forza Horizon 4 and similar games

&amp;#x200B;

\* \*\*If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?\*\*  

No specific games, Far Cry 5, COD WW, Forza Horizon 4 and similar games as I get my hands on them.

&amp;#x200B;

\* \*\*Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?\*\*   

Good Display because video and photo editing work and good enough build.

&amp;#x200B;

\* \*\*Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.\*\* 

Are there companies which offer global warranty or lets you transfer the warranty to other countries? Because I was thinking if I could ask a friend to buy one for me in US and then bring it over here.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, every model isn't available in India.

"Indian government borrows money at 4-6% higher interest rate than most of developed countries This is a bit technical topic so I have tried to simplify it with some approximations.

Governments across the world need to borrow money to manage their day to day finances. These are in form of bonds. The money borrowed is given by investors (such as banks, worldwide specialist funds, other country's central banks) which demand a certain interest rate to lend money to a government. Another dimension is maturity of loan (does government want 1 yr loan, 2 yr loan, 5 yr loan, 10 yr loan, 20, 30 yr loan).

One of the most popular series is to compare interest rate on a 10 yr loan paid by various countries. While India has a yield (read as interest rate for simplification) of 6.4% for 10 yr bond, countries like Switzerland, Germany, France, Japan have a negative interest rate. This means investors are 'okay' losing money for holding money in these countries. Imagine taking a home loan and paying negative interest rate on it.

"Did Delhi just show us a new Election Template to effectively counter 'Hate' Politics? Yesterday, as the counting started, I was glued to my TV, wondering about the fate of our democracy and questioning if people would still remain blindfolded. But not much to my surprise, voters of Delhi gave this huge mandate against the decisive policies and stood up with a progressive approach.

Now as the analysis were going on, experts on TV pointed out some really interesting traits of Kejriwal's Election campaign, which were basically some core reasons behind this victory:

>Not getting into communal vs secular scenario

>Made arguments on work profile.

>Assumed a soft hindutva position. Rejected an Idea that is Hindutva but not a belief that is Hinduism.

>Redefined 'Nationalism'. Rejected Bhajapa's version of the same thing.

>Avoided any direct, serious 'Dig' at NaMo

>Avoided Shaheen bagh

There maybe more than these.

"The state if suppression and labeling those in dissent as anti-national 

India above everything is a democracy. But the ruling government has turned it into a revenge saga where every voice against it is seditioned.  

Any reason that goes in favour of government is strictly supporting suppression. 

A law is a law. Let CAA be implemented. Let NPR  be implemented but snatching a citizens right to protest, labelling them against the interest of nation, how can that be justified? 

The governments outreach program is aimed to gain support of like minded people and not pacify the dissenting citizens. 

There’s a reason Hon’ble is prefixed against union ministers and they are just ganging up now?
As if the GOVERNMENT will reward them for hate speech. The more the better, is that how those union minister works now?

"Automation In Our Society 
One word has become synonymous with the current economy and job market, that's automation. Automation has been happening all around us for years, but the pace of it has increased substantially in recent times. We are staring at highly automated work environments where the need for people has become inefficient, automation has crept up slowly across industries and has become a major threat to future economies of countries. The problem is, that there hasn't been a concrete solution, no one seems to be agreeing on what could be the solution to this. 


Automation, in manufacturing industry has been constantly increasing, the coveted assembly line model by Henry Ford that streamlined the manufacturing process by making it efficient has in these modern times been a reason for automation to take over jobs. A decade or two ago you could see people working in assembly line, but now if you go to any manufacturing plant there is a high chance that you'll be seeing people only doing quality inspection on the assembly lines instead of doing any assembly, that's because all of it is being done by Robots that have gotten so efficient and cost effective in the long run that there is no reason to have people assembling it. 


Look at the IT sector for an example a decade ago when you dialled a customer support of a company there would be people picking up your phone and addressing you concern or complaints but now when you call customer support of a company, it's a jumbled mess of pre recorded options that you press, if you are lucky and have pressed the right options for a couple of times you might get lucky and actually have a person who might address your problem. Now think about both of these examples, the expertise required for assembling has been replaced by inspection of assembled stuff, which requires much less technical knowledge and experience. Same goes for the IT sector, now a couple of hundred of people can handle a country's customer support because of pre recorded options. This has obviously helped in increasing productivity in both industries and has made it easier and efficient process.


There have been people who have dismissed the buzz words of AI (Artificial Intelligence) and ML (Machine Learning), but software tools powered by AI and ML have been able to make a dent in management industry as well. For some time automation has only affected the workers or the labour intensive tasks, but AI powered software has made many management position redundant. In the service industry, you can already see bigger retailers, either going online or having less and less number of people employed in their stores, with the high penetration of internet, now payments have become increasingly cashless and you can see stores with self checkout counters in the west. You shouldnt be surprised if in the future you enter a mall early morning to get your groceries and you end up being the only person in the whole mall, since every task now has been automated. 


The major industry that is yet to be affected by this onslaught of automation has been driving, the goods carriers, the taxi drivers and truck drivers, the delivery guy who delivers your Amazon orders or the Swiggy guy who delivers you your food. There is a big chance that over the decade you might see all of them disappear, with self driving cars and trucks, drone delivery for goods becoming a reality, the industry will move quickly and make all of these automated. Atleast, now you can take that extra nap you need in your self driving car when you head out to work or eat your breakfast in it. 


Imagining all of this, must give people a sense of comfort, on how the future will be becoming more convenient, but the fact is that it would come at cost of hundreds of thousands of jobs. While, it is true that newer jobs will be created, there is no doubt that it will never be as many as automation will be replacing. There have been solutions to these suggested such as robot tax which is taxing a company more for more automation, or solutions such as Universal Basic Income which addresses the post automation world where jobs are less and people need to be subsidised for living. While not working does seem like an absurd option, maybe it actually isn't, hobbies can become lifestyle choices, more people can go into sports, with the space exploration in the horizon maybe we can go back to exploration, while this will obviously guarantee that capitalism will make the balance of society uneven where we will have the ultra rich that will have majority of the wealth distributed among a single percent of the population, it will be the job of the future governments, economists and leaders to address these problems.

"Mental Health Therapy service for NRIs Hey Everyone,

**tl;dr – if you are like me, I want to arrange free online therapy for you (with a small catch).**

Big fan of this sub. It's been really great to read news about India and be able to discuss it. 

**About Me**

My name is Prakash. My family is from Kerala and I grew up in Hong Kong. After my primary and secondary school there, I ended up going to the Bay Area for university. After 7 years in the Bay, I moved back to India in order to work (believed that there were interesting things happening in consumer tech).

I’ve also had depression since I was 12, ended up getting hospitalized for it and then spent significant time figuring out how to manage it with a therapist.

What really helped me was moving back to India and being able to talk to a therapist who could understand the specific cultural issues that I was going through. I didn’t have the greatest relationship with my parents and it was sometimes really difficult to get a handle on my more negative thought patterns. My decision to move back to India was also really hard - lots of family members questioning my sanity and a lot of self doubt (am I stupidly just chasing risk?). Finally, I had a lot of insecurity about how I looked because I was usually the only brown person in the rooms I was moving in (and Hong Kong is not the most accepting place for people of colour).

**What I’m trying to do**

After having spent time both abroad and in India, I realized that there weren’t that many therapists abroad that could understand where I was coming from and that my Indian therapist was a lot more effective because of our shared cultural background.

I’m currently trying to see if other people feel this way, so here’s what I’m proposing -

Go to this website [www.talkfreely.uk](https://www.talkfreely.uk/) and sign up.

I’ll reach out to you via email and schedule a weekly online session with a therapist.

For the first 5 weeks, this service will be free, after which it will cost you roughly 20 pounds per hour (or your equivalent local currency).

In return, you and I jump on a short call every week so you can help me iron out the operational kinks. I want to get feedback on what’s effective and what’s not, so that I can make the service better.

**Caveats**

If you’re facing really SERIOUS depression or another serious mental health disorder, DO NOT use this service. You need to get professional help in person.

If you’re in the US, you unfortunately **can’t use** this service because of regulation. If you’re in the UK, Singapore, HK, Dubai…you’re fine. The pricing is set in pounds, but I'm happy to convert to the currency of your choice.",Scheduled

"[AskIndia] How many of you think we will be come a superpower? Indians often like to call India a counterbalance to China and it's influence in Asia. However as of now I don't see that happening. What I see happening however is China's autocratic leadership isn't able to squash it's own people. Which leads to social and political unrest causing an economic slowdown. This will take 30-40 years at the minimum. At this point though, India is large enough an economy that it starts taking over the mantle from China about Asian leadership. And genuinely rises in influence and power to be called a superpower. Do you see that happening? And which factors will actually hasten this process? Some dramatic changes in policy?

"What are we doing parents, teachers and tutors? So I am an independent education consultant from India - who has worked with kids in gaining admissions to top colleges in the US (Cornell, Brown, UPenn), Canada (McGill, Toronto, UBC), and UK (Imperial, Cambridge, Warwick). The past three years that I have spent doing this has brought me closer to the realities of teenhood in modern India. I have become increasingly disillusioned by the number of expectations we have from the young ones! I struggle to schedule calls and meetings with high school students because their schedules are so busy! I have even had calls at midnight in some cases as that's the only time the kid could find.

I am not even sure where this spiral is leading to? The kids are coached at every stage and even overcoached with tuitions starting as early as second grade and parents fretting about if their 4 years old can code?! As someone who grew up in the 90s in India - with a reasonable level of education pressure at the hands of the Indian education system - I sometimes wish I could put a pause on this madness and let the kids be! We have a generation that doesn't know the respite of the languid summer days, the hours spent in a limited screen environment just mucking about the house making scrapbooks, getting dirty or doing whatever the hell WE wanted. Now I know I am going down the rose-tinted glasses route - but as kid boredom leads to discovery. The afternoon I spent going door to door in our building trying to sell peanuts that I found in the house (to the utter embarrassment of my middle-class service job parents) taught me things, the time I spent trying to teach my brother math just because he was a ready audience meant something. What did that have to do with going abroad at 17 for me? NOTHING! But they are the fondest memories that continue to affect my well being even decades later.

A key part of me working with kids is exploring their dreams and aspirations when it comes to going to college abroad and when I start throwing around words like dreams and aspirations and interests I am very often met with silent stares or rehearsed answers that they seem to have heard from their parents at a dinner party. We have all seen the ads for tuition centres that promise superior coaching by IIT alumni or the mind-boggling number of apps that are literally in our faces all the time. The coding academy, the robotics classes, the tuitions for the school tuition, the study abroad fairs with ""direct"" admissions, the new swanky IB school, the freaking fingerprint career aptitude test (yep you heard it right) ... spiralling into a multi-billion dollar industry that profits off the parental anxieties. I have been part of it ... and I don't think I want to be at least till I think this more.

But, now I am closer to saying ""rehne do!"" or ""let them be!"" But then we add in the element of international admissions and we can't ""rehne do!"" So I think in India we love us some formulas - with parents that are a direct result of formulaic learning themselves when we look at international education preparation we just work better with equations. This much social service, this much coding, this much school activities, this much SAT etc etc etc. We approach the SAT like we approach the JEE. With the idea to ""Crack it!"" whatever that means. We put our kids in IB curriculum which is individualistic and intensive, at schools which promise the best teachers - yet send our kids lugging round to tuitions. I mean if I need tuitions after paying Rs 10,00,000 + in fees - what am I paying for?! Then there are those resume-building activities - the internships that you source from a friend of a friend, the certificates from causes and NGOs that magically appear and that the kids feign enthusiasm for in their essays. I think the study abroad aspirations hit our shores like the cyclone hitting Rameshwaram. And in the winds, it is the teens who were swept up.

I speak from the Indian perspective but if the ""success"" of varsity blues scandal in the US, or the rise of Asian tiger mom ideology is anything to go by the issue seems like an international educational challenge that we aren't talking about enough. I get it that we want our kids to study in the best colleges if we are paying millions of dollars converted from our Indian incomes - but I feel like there is a better way for us to approach this. I would like to hear your opinions as I continue finding my own way through this chaos. Let's talk people!",Scheduled

"In need of urgent advice regarding career! Please help. Hi,

I am a 25 year old Indian national living in Thailand with my family. I did my undergrad in Thailand in BBA in Finance. After that I joined my family trading business of loose diamonds. After a year in the business, I joined a Thailand based diamond jewelry export company (owned by an Indian-American). 

I am working in the jewelry company for the past two years but since I am the youngest I am given odd works. I am being paid 55,000 baht per month (after tax). 

I was wondering what my options for a secure future are? I am starting to get complacent in my job - getting comfortable with my monthly salary which I do not want. If I get fired or if I want to switch my job, I do not feel I have enough skills to get an equivalent salary. 

Another issue is that the jewelry industry is shrinking. I am also not sure if I enjoy the industry as much. I have a few options in mind but opinions are needed. My options are -

2. MBA
3. Starting a business

I don't know if there is a system in place to screen people who apply for the job, if it's there it needs to improve if not then put in place. This just shows the mental health of these people. They are no more than gundas in the uniform and we do not need those people. 

I want these people be kicked out of the force because of them people are worried /scared more then they need to be.

"I have been getting calls from some organization called Child Help Foundation and want to know if they are legit. So some lady called Seema contacted me yesterday asking me to donate some money for some child's operation. I was outside at the time and asked her to contact me later. So she called me again today. When I asked her where she got my number from, she is not replying. On repeatedly asking, she said some database (but was very vague about it). I started asking her multiple questions about the disease and treatment and all she said she will send me pictures and documents about it, but was once again, very vague. On asking her more questions about the hospital, she kept saying they are legit and the child needs help. When I bluffed and said that since I am a journalist, let me do some background check and get back to you, she sounded a little concerned and said okay and asked me to call back when I can.

Now I have been doing some research and found a website and all for this, but there is absolutely no buzz on the thing they want to the fact that it seems made up. I found something about the child she mentioned and apparently the surgery was scheduled for yesterday, so dunno why she is calling me today also. I found a similar letter of appeal from the doctor she mentioned by name, but for another child. I don't know, a lot of things about this whole thing seem fishy.

**TL;DR - I wanted to know if anyone has gotten a call from some Seema (or anyone else) from Child Help Foundation asking for a donation for a child called Sia Samanta who's operation costs 16.5 Lakhs. If it is fake, I am legit going to a journalist friend and tweeting to the cops about this shit along with her number and all so they don't exploit other people.**",Scheduled

"We really need to talk about Flairs. Hello /r/india  
  
Here are some clarifications on submission flairs, since we see a lot of mis-flaired posts from time to time.  
  
**[P] - Political**  
  
These are for political posts only. If a post involved any politician, political party or anything primarily related to politics, then it must be flaired as political  
  
**[NP] - Non-political**  
  
These are for discussions where you are confident there is no politics involved. You cannot flair a post that is primarily or tangentially related to politics with an NP tag.  
 
This is important because quite a few people use the filters we have on the sidebar to filter out political (or non-political) posts, and misflairing one as the other may irritate these users.  
  
**[R] - Reddiquette**  
  
When this flair is selected, Reddit's Reddiquette guidelines are enforced in the thread, along with certain other restrictions so as to have a slightly higher quality discussion.    
  
Jokes, puns and low effort comments will be removed in such threads.
  
This can be used for both political and non-political topics.  
  
**[ASK] - AskIndia**  
  
These are flairs for self-posts where the OP wants to ask the community a question. You cannot use this flair for link posts (because that makes no sense unless ToI or HT wants to ask /r/india a question).  
  
If the question is political in nature, then the thread must be flaired with P or R, not with AskIndia. This is to prevent filters from being breached.  
  
**Science & Technology** 

This flair is for topics with an explicit, mostly non-political science & technology bent to it. If it tangentially involves politics, it is fine to use this flair in place of [P].   
 
If Modi makes a comment about the ISRO, then it is a P thread.  
If the ISRO conducts some research that points to where state governments can improve with irrigation, and a politician comments on that, then it can be flaired with Science & Technology assuming the primary focus of the story isn't the politician's comment.  

**Policy & Economy**
  
These flairs work similarly. The main topic of the subject matter should be about policy or economy. The instant the focus shifts to politics, political parties, politicians, etc. the flair must be [P].  

**Business & Finance**  

These flairs are for articles, or self-post submissions with a non-political, business bent to them. If you want to know where to invest or if Ola Cabs decides to go public, then this is the flair for you.  
  
**Entertainment** 

Entertainment flair is exclusively for pop-culture links, submissions, and discussions. Examples under this flair include movie trailers, movie clips, comics, YouTube joke sketches and things along those lines.  
  
This flair cannot be used for some politician saying something absurd, funny or ridiculous. That constitutes an editorialization of the title on the part of the OP - since the OP insinuates that the subject matter is funny with the title (instead of letting the reader make up their mind).   
 
**Sports and Food** 

Sports & Food flairs are very self-explanatory  

**AMA**
  
AMA flairs are given to OPs who verify their identity with the mod team. In case they choose not to verify, they will get an **Unverified** flair.  
  
**In-Depth**

This flair must be used carefully.This flair *only* used when you need an In-depth discussion about the topic. Top comments must have a proper explanation/discussion about the top. Top comments must fulfil the word limit else the comment **will** get deleted by all mighty automod.

---  
PS - In the event of confusion, just go for Reddiquette.
  
Recommendations for new flairs may be made below.  ",Science/Technology

"It's time for Indians to invest in Canada It's time for Indians to invest in Canada

Jagdish Pathak

There are more than one million Indian-origin immigrants in Canada. But compared to rising number of Indian-origin immigrants, Indian investment has not kept pace in Canada. However, slowly but steadily, Indian investments are trickling into the Canadian economy. Economic stability has become key to Canada's success and is decisive in attracting investors from all over the world to its shores. Investment in Canada is considered a safe haven for investors' hard-earned money and continues to represent a solid foundation for future growth and prosperity. 

Canada is the No. 1 investment destination in the G7 and was ranked 4th in the world as the best country to conduct business over the period 2010-14, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit's Business Environment Ranking August 2010 report. 

Indian investors have still been shy about investing in Canada. Most investors from India prefer the UK and Europe as well as the countries of the Middle East, historically. Outside this region, Indian investments are scattered and limited. Canada is a stable, secure nation, and endowed with abundant natural resources. Its currency has always been very stable and its safest borders are with the largest economy of the world. Canada/US relations can be described as the best that any two nations can have. 

Canada ranks 27th in terms of FDI investment in India and its investments are mostly in the development sector. Whereas Indian FDI approved until 2009 in Canada is restricted to $570 million and ranks as the 20th destination of Indian investments. 

Recently, in Windsor, I saw a big hoarding on the road showing the name ""Aditya Birla"" on it. I stopped and looked at it with admiration, thinking, at last, Indian investors have made up their mind to make Canada their destination for good. 

Indian investors should consider Canada and especially the province of Ontario to be the hub of their North American business activities. Ontario has liberal laws, a huge existing infrastructure, and various tax benefits to investors, relatively milder climate, fertile farmlands and, without doubt, some of the best golf courses in the world in your neighborhood. 

People here are well aware of Indian investments in the automotive sector of the UK. During the purchasing phase of the Jaguar and Land Rover deal by Tata, India and its investors were commonly discussed in Ontario bars and restaurants. Ontario is the hub of automotive industries and support services for manufacturing automobiles of big-3: US and Japanese car manufacturers like Honda and Toyota. Southwestern Ontario is a key entry point for US and South American markets. 

Canadians are very knowledgeable about India and its information technology-related successes. India is no longer a nation of beggars and snake- charmers in the minds of a younger generation of Canadian citizens. Growth of the Indian software industry has made a big mark on the Canadian psyche. 

Any investment in Canada will have to be planned over the long term similar to US investors in the past. Canadian oil and energy, forestry, mines and minerals, and gold and diamond resources are some of the best resources for investors to look at. The Canadian higher education system is one of the best in the world and at par with the US, resulting in students from across the globe studying and performing high quality research. 

Investors from India are relatively conservative by nature and prefer to satisfy some critical marks before deciding to invest. Canada is one such country which should be the destination of long-term investors from India. One might look at some of the investments made by Indian investors in the Ontario province and think how much is there on offer in this well-endowed province alone. Investments by Essar group in energy and steel, by Mahindra Satyam and Wipro in the IT sector are a good beginning. However, the quantity of investment is negligible, compared to China, which is making substantial investment in the core sectors of oil and energy, solar and wind power generation and forestry. 

A strategic investment in developed nations like Canada goes with the Indian aspiration of becoming a global power. Indian investors can fulfill such desires in conjunction with the geo-political leadership potential of India.

"Hi, /r/India! TRAI wants to know how we can hold telecom operators accountable for mobile data speeds. Here's how you can make your voice heard. Firstly, here is the consultation paper: [Consultation Paper on Data Speed Under Wireless Broadband Plans](http://www.trai.gov.in/sites/default/files/CP_Data_speed_01062017.pdf) [PDF]

###**What is this?**

TRAI wants to know **how mobile Internet providers should be held more accountable for the data speeds they advertise.** Mobile data speeds are much more variable and unpredictable than fixed-line broadband connections, so TRAI is looking at whether they should make a 'label' from telcos mandatory that specifies what kind of speeds customers should expect from their connections. TRAI also wants to know what kind of tech they can use to *measure* how fast telcos' connections actually are for their subscribers.

###**Sounds great! How do I send in my ideas?**

First of all, take a deep breath. Telcos are going to have a really long answer to this consultation, and their lobbying will be polished and elaborate -- they do **not want to be regulated.** If you are a concerned citizen, you need to make your voice *heard*, not just *counted.*

Telecom consultation filings are not rocket science. You can send in a good and insightful response, and it won't take you more than an hour or two. Remember, your response **will be read**, and this TRAI administration leans towards consumers. 

**Read the consultation paper.** [Here's the link again](http://www.trai.gov.in/sites/default/files/CP_Data_speed_01062017.pdf). Read it fully, it's only 30 pages long, and gives you enough context and information to be able to answer the questions.

**Draft a response.** This should not take you very long. You have a month to send a response in, so just spend a couple days collating all the points you want to mention in your response, order them under subheads, and work them into your answers to each question.

Make a PDF or Word Document of your response and email it to **kapilhanda@trai.gov.in**.

###**Cool! What's the deadline?**

The deadline is **29th June**. You can email TRAI and ask them to extend this deadline if you feel that this time is not adequate, and they usually do extend deadlines upon request. But try and get in on this right as telcos do, because TRAI may read responses as and when they ge them.

The deadline for **counter-comments**, which is an ***equally important stage***, if not more, where you have to counter arguments made by other responders, is **13th July**. 

###**What are the questions?**

Here are the questions TRAI wants you to answer. (emphasis all mine; text slightly edited for clarity). If you feel like you don't know the context for some of these questions, check the consultation paper; it will probably answer any questions you might have about the existing regulatory framework that telcos face.

Q1: Is the information on wireless broadband [mobile internet] speeds currently available to consumers *transparent enough* to help them make informed choices?

Q2: If it is difficult [for telcos] to commit to a minimum download speed, then could an
average speed be specified by service providers? What should
be the parameters for calculating this average speed?

Q3: What changes can be brought about to the *existing framework* on
wireless broadband tariff plans to encourage better transparency
and comparison between plans offered by different service
providers?

Q4: Is there a need to *include or delete* any of the *QoS parameters*
and/or revise any of the benchmarks currently stipulated in the
Regulations?

Q5: Should disclosure of *average network performance* over a period
of time or at peak times including through broadband facts/labels
be made *mandatory*?

Q6: Should standard application/websites be identified for mandating
comparable disclosures about network speeds?

Q7: What are the products/technologies that can be used to measure
actual end-user experience on mobile broadband networks? At
what level should the measurements take place (e.g., on the 
device, network node)?

Q8: *Are there any legal, security, privacy or data sensitivity issues
with collecting device level data?*

a) If so, how can these issues be addressed?  
b) Do these issues create a challenge for the adoption of any
measurement tools?

Q9: What measures can be taken to *increase awareness among
consumers* about wireless broadband speeds, availability of
various technological tools to monitor them and any potential
concerns that may arise in the process?

Q10: Any other issue related to the matter of Consultation.

Remember, if there's something that you think this consultation paper missed out on, include it in response to question 10.",Science/Technology

"Rant: Are we condemned to being ignorant? I've been wanting to write this for a *long* time but somehow haven't been able to make time to sit and pen it down. This will be long, so please bear with me. 


Many months back, I came across this [interview](http://www.rediff.com/news/interview/aatish-taseer-india-is-semi-literate-and-chetan-bhagat-is-the-best-it-can-do/20150205.htm) with Aatish Taseer, where he calls India a ""semi-literate"" country. I was quite baffled then, by his words. Why would someone with such deep connections to India make such a disparaging comment on its citizens? Its true significance has finally hit me and it's making me sad.

We're a country of a billion people with few opportunities and deep contrasts. However instead of trying to bridge the divide, mend the fracture and soothe the pain, we keep insisting on magnifying the gap and adding salt to the wounds. 

How did we become so politically incorrect as a nation? How did we let bigotry define us to such a large extent? How did we let education fail us?

As Indians, our single goal as kids has been reduced to clearing entrance exams without realising the kind of studies that we're getting involved in, to get there. We're not broadening our minds to ideas, we're not enhancing our understanding of ourselves, we're not experimenting with out of the box ideas on science and technology. No. As 15-16 year old kids, we're solving questions. Recognising patterns. Trying to understand the examiner's psyche in order to get the most questions correct, sometimes spending months and even years in those hallowed halls they call coaching institutes. If you manage to set aside all the hoopla around coaching institutions, they're merely *cram schools*. Even our neighbouring China has them. But we as kids, and more importantly our parents, don't want to be told of that. Because deep down, that term *cram school* conflicts with our idea of what education should be all about. I, like many millions, was also a victim of this. Yes, I made it though. But I'm under no illusion about exactly what I've achieved. I've crammed and smarted my way through entrance exams by recognising patterns and understanding ""important concepts"" without ever learning to think for myself.

And then the results are in front of us to see. This [video](https://youtu.be/Rfw5nQy5_pw) popped up on the front page of my YouTube yesterday and I ended up watching it. One of the kids here appears to be incredibly cocky about what he thinks of people who weren't able to qualify for IIT. I don't blame the guy, maybe a few years back I'd have behaved the same way. But he exposes how limited our understanding is, of education. Our entrance exams, be it medical or engineering, are tough *because* we have such a huge population. That and because the number of institutions of repute (even though the IITs don't even rank among the very best institutes in the world) in this country is embarrassingly minuscule. 

College education is a similar tragedy. Teachers merely teach. Students merely attend classes. Teachers get promoted after a few years, students graduate every year. The teachers have no incentive to teach, they don't get promoted because of the performance of their students, they don't get recognition for using exemplary methods of teaching. And yet they expect students to do well, grasp concepts and become contributors to the society, magically. Our respect for teachers in this country runs deep. Unfortunately, that blinds us to the gross callousness with which most of them do their *jobs*. As a result, we graduate not as informed educated citizens, capable of engaging with a wide range of people on a variety of topics, but as robots. Robots capable of working efficiently, without having the ability to position us in the grand scheme of things, without having the ability to question and without having a worldview. 

But enough about institutional education. What about how we think? Do we even know *how* to think? Are we tolerant enough and respectful enough to differences of opinion? Are we accommodative enough? Do we know our history? Do we know who we are as a country? 

In the comments section of the same video I shared, you'll see many plainly abusive comments about SC STs made without realising how bigoted they sound. The hatred for the lower castes is clear. The hatred, often, isn't even about reservations. It's about a group of people who we think don't deserve to be where they are, or more specifically, where they are being allowed to go. How oblivious, how shallow and how deeply rotten do we have to be, to pick on the weakest section of the society, the SC STs?

The tragedy is not that we are bigots. The tragedy is how we *fail to recognise* how bigoted we are. The tragedy is not that we are inherently casteist as a society. The tragedy is that we constantly *fail to recognise* how casteist we are as a society. 

This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ1EgsRT1zk), an interview by Ravish Kumar of an African student, exposes just how limited our understanding is of race. He is referred to as a ""gorilla"" in nowhere else but the capital city of the country. How can we as a nation, as a colonised nation in the past, not empathise with Africans? How can we be racist to a group of people who were treated the same way as we were by colonial powers of the day? In other words, how deeply has our education system failed us, that we have lost the ability to recognise our shared history?

If you go through comments on Twitter (and no I don't mean just the hateful comments directed towards a particular group of people), you'll realise how incredibly easy we find ourselves to be insensitive, even when we're not hiding under the hood of anonymity. An Indian woman, from a religious minority, was rescued by the government from a foreign country, in an astonishing attempt that brought out in me a deep sense of respect for government officers and diplomats. And then I read disparaging comments about her family on Twitter on the same day, by religious nut jobs. Add to that the hegemony, a certain group of people hold in our society, and the whole thing becomes scary. 

Bigotry and hatred, borne out of ignorance and pure cluelessness, have become a disease. And I will not even mention Facebook here because that is a cesspool of hideous ideas. Even some of my friends and colleagues, who I've known for a long time, have in many cases become absolute hypocrites, espousing hatred towards the disadvantaged and more importantly, towards the *different*. It's not about conflicting ideas of conservatism and liberalism. Its not even about the right and the left. It's about basic decency and having a semblance of understanding about our position as Indians in the world.

I do not excuse myself of this prejudice, of course. Having become a product of this system, I've also become a victim of the same kind of regressive thought processes that haunt many. May we all strive to, at least, *recognise* this, and if possible, mend our ways. 

We deserve better compatriots. Our children deserve better peers. And most importantly, this country deserves better citizens.

"Redmi Note 7 Pro vs Realme X **Realme X:** 4+128: 17k | ~~8+128: 20k~~ (I cannot afford this)

**Redmi Note 7 Pro:** 4+64: 14k | 6+64: 15k | 6+128: 17k

**My use:** A couple of messaging apps, a social media app, e-mails, light web browsing, sometimes Kindle app, a lot of music, some video playback, a few other apps. No gaming.

**My top priority question:** Considering advancement in Android (memory footprint of newer apps, power/RAM-management features of newer Android versions), is 4 GB RAM enough in this era?

**Other things to consider:**

* Camera: Undecided - I don't take many pics but it is important. AFAIK both have the same sensor but how is post-processing? I do not care about selfies.
* Audio: Realme X - I saw that Realme has Dolby Atmos so kinda leaning towards it
* Screen: Realme X - I have never used anything with a notch so far so I'm not sure how I'm going to feel about notch of RN7P.
* Battery: Realme X - RN7P has a bigger battery but RX has a fast charger in-box.
* SoC: I don't care as long as it gives fluid experience.
* \*add something if there is anything else to consider\*

So in the end, I am stuck because of the camera and the topic of memory requirement/management. Help me with it!

Did I pick the correct device in the rest of the categories?

Considering Vivo Z1 Pro on the side. It has a much bigger battery with 18 W charger &amp; a newer SoC. However, I cannot stand micro-USB &amp; I'm unsure about its camera from various reviews. But let me know if you think its pros outweigh the effing micro-USB (I don't know why I hate it!!).

Or is there any upcoming phone within my price range (around 15k)?

I was very interested in upcoming Mi A3 but 720p AMOLED is painful. I had smaller AMOLED screens and over 5 inches it was okay at best. 6 inches is meh.

I have checked several Samsung phones, and I have decided against them for various reasons (VFM, past experience). Still, if you have a strong recommendation for a Samsung phone let me know.

"[AskIndia] Fathers/mothers of Reddit India, what were the 38-41 weeks of pregnancy like for you? Long post ahead. Hi everyone!

I am currently in my 25th week (late 2nd trimester) and I'm trying to educate myself about what lies ahead for me. I have to zero in on the most important decision - the city of birth (job city?/my hometown?/husband's hometown?). I need to decide this ASAP as traveling after 28 weeks(April end that is) is generally not advised.

Which brings me to making this post here. I want to gather all the information/anectodes/experiences, in a countdown way, about the D-Day/D-weeks. If the circumstances allow, I would prefer a normal delivery. However, I totally understand how uncertain pregnancies can get. I just feel being informed can help us stay less anxious & not panic. Its going to be long and my thoughts might seem all over the place, so please bear with me. Here are my questions:

1) How frequent are the scheduled* OB/GYN visits in the very last month, assuming a normal pregnancy? Currently I visit once a month, for routine check up and milestone/mandated tests (flu vaccination, various blood tests, sonography, etc)

*(By scheduled I mean no complication was experienced by the woman or any urgency(water breaking, bleeding, etc) occured)

2) One lady who had the same OBGYN as me when went for her scheduled 37th week visit, was told she will have a C-Section as the child is getting overweight (weighing 3 kgs then). The OBGYN asked her to soon decide which date she would like the surgery to happen and let the doctor know. The lady said she however got labor pain the very next day and delivered via vaginal delivery. Now, I am a little skeptical here; from what I've read, **2.5-3.5 kgs is the average birth weight for newborns in India**. How can 3 kgs be overweight then? I'm already very paranoid about the state of deliveries in urban, big-name hospitals and this incident scares me more. There is no data public on the number of normal and surgical deliveries a hospital has, so that one can decide, and once you're in, you're in. After that, you have to leave everything at the doctor.

3) One lady who delivered at the same hospital (different OBGYN) as me, went at 37 weeks when she felt contractions. Her cervix was examined twice in a 5 hour span. She said she couldn't bear going through that painful examination again and asked for a C-Section herself (totally fair). My question is, are these cervix examinations by hand so necessary, when they're leaving the bearing lady in pain? Is there no other way (imaging, ultrasound, etc)? My point is those contractions could have been what is called 'false labor' and if not for the pain due to the examination, that lady could have gone home and come again full-term or when she felt contractions again?

4) My sister went for a scheduled visit in 38th week. Her cervix was examined, she started bleeding. She was told to come back if bleeding continued till evening, which it did. She had to be operated the next day, after staying in labor room for some 24-32 hours. This again makes me skeptical about cervix examinations.

5) What's the countdown going to be like? When does one know that ""yes, its now that I rush to the hospital."" Should I be scared of just a few drops of blood? Should I rush the very first time I experience period like cramps? From my few interactions with mothers, I feel 37-38 weeks is the sweet spot where many things happen. I know my post gives a lot of distrusting vibes towards doctors, that they're there to loot us, they try to 'invent' some complication in these sweet spot weeks to push for C-Sections, etc. Trust me, I would like to be proven wrong. Hence, I'm here to collect as much anectodes about false alarms, doctor sending the lady home even after mild contractions as its not time yet instead of asking to schedule a C-Section, etc as I can.

5) From what I understand, some women might never experience labor even after 40-41 weeks and hence have to be induced. Are some women induced before that too? What could lead to induction before full term?

6) Do all women having a vaginal delivery get an epidural/other pain medication, or only those who demand it when they get tired, or when they can't bear pain?

7) Did anyone research natural birth centers? There are many in the major cities, like 1) Sanctum Birth Center, Hyderabad, 2) Birth Village, Kochi, 3) Daimaas Natural Birth Center, Mumbai, 4) Apollo Cradle, Gurugram. Google reviews are mixed. Anyone undertook the services of these natural birth centers?

So everyone, contribute what you can towards my questions & in general, your pregnancy stories.",Scheduled

"How do I transliterate a dynamic page from English to Marathi/Hindi? So this is a slightly technical question that requires more detail than the title.

I own a restaurant that receives orders on Swiggy, Zomato, Dunzo and other online platforms. Due to the aggregator restrictions, I can only receive and display orders in my restaurant in English. However, my staff cannot read English and is unable to process orders until someone reads it out to them.

I tried the Google translate plugin, but it's only about 60% accurate and it's unable to translate some specific terms like ""Sriracha"" or ""Chipotle"" and absolutely butchers other terms like ""pizza pockets"" or ""hot dog"". I also cannot customise the output of the plugin

What I'm looking for is a way to transliterate the words phonetically for each menu item. So, for example, ""burger"" should display as ""बर्गर"" and ""hot dog"" should display as ""हॉट डॉग"".

This will allow my staff to read the items and prepare the order without intervention from English speakers. The order page interface is also dynamic, and new orders need to be transliterated as they come in. The Google translate plugin automatically translates new orders, but again it's terribly inaccurate.

Would really appreciate any help from you guys on this. I'm sure many other restaurants face similar problems and require a similar solution. Thanks in advance.",AskIndia

"TL;DR – Godman to Tycoon – The Untold Story of Baba Ramdev Context – Yesterday in a thread I happened to mention reading this book and a few redditors had suggested doing a TL;DR of the book once I am finished. 

On the onset if you have the time and resources, I would highly recommend reading the book. It’s published by Juggernaut and is available for reading on their app at Rs. 80. I have read a few biographies and they can often go either way. This is one of few good biographies I have read, partly due to the Caravan Magazine style free flow writing rather than meandering on author’s perceptions and also because the subject (Baba Ramdev) is a fascinating and an intriguing person. It took me three days and essentially three sittings to complete it. The author – Priyanka Pathak Narain is a journalist who used to cover the religion and spirituality section for Mint and that is where she begins on this journey. As part of the book she has interviewed over 52 subjects including Balakrishna – Ramdev’s deputy and owner of 94% of shares of Patanjali Ayurveda Ltd. 

So here we go

* Baba Ramdev (Ram Kisan Yadav) was born in Said Alipur in a poor farming family. A sickly child he rather became very obese and was a victim to his father’s frequent violent outbursts. 

* Somewhere in his early 20s, he finds a band of Arya Samaj workers and is immediately drawn to them. He joined Khanpur gurukul where he learnt Sanskrit grammar, tended cows, collected alms and met his future deputy-to-be Acharya Balakrishna

* Balakrishna is quite into Ayurveda and is from Haridwar where he befriends **Acharya Karamveer** – a stoic, soft spoken Arya Samaj member who had three post graduate degrees in Yoga, Indian Philosophy and Vedas. Karamveer soon takes Balakrishna under his wing and soon Ramdev joins them after a controversy.

* Ramdev learns yoga from Karamveer. To propagate Yoga to masses they soon take over ownership from **Shankar Dev**, a patron of Kripalu Bagh Ashram at Haridwar. Shankar Dev wants and only trusts Karamveer. But since he is Arya Samaj member he is not just ready to take Sanyas. Sensing an opportunity, Ramdev steps in. Taking Sanyas means two things -  1) He can’t keep any formal relations with his family 2) He cannot maintain any material wealth. I am bringing this up of course because this is very important

* Balakrishna meanwhile sets up Divya Pharmacy using the license of a silent partner, Swami Yogananda. Balakrishna himself from **Nepal** has legal cases against him (still in courst) for forging his high school and other documents to attain a passport.

* In early 2000s, Aastha and Sanskar become household name. The TV guys select Ramdev over Karamveer because - saffron robes means authenticity. **An interesting story here is that after Aastha turned Ramdev down, our diligent Baba went to Sanskar paying Rs 1 Lakh for a twenty minute slot.** This is also where I learnt that channels like Sanskar and Aastha don’t earn from advertising but godmen paying them for TV slots to demonstrate their abilities

* We all now know the story. Ramdev becomes a household name, not only to nauli kriya or churning of the stomach but also his personality, self-depreciating humor and showmanship 

* Soon Ramdev has friends at high places. **Mulayam Singh, ND Tiwari from Congress, Sudarshan Agarwal – ex UP governor.** So when they are charged with Sales Tax fraud, Sudarshan Agarwal mounts immense pressure on Sales Tax Deputy Commissioner to drop the case and retire.

* Ramdev soon brings his extended family who takes over the business. His younger brother Ram Bharat is soon in charge of the finances. This causes rift between Karamveer and Ramdev. Afterall Ramdev shouldn’t have familial relations. So one day, Karamveer just walks out. 

* Swami Yogananda (whose license enabled the setting up of Divya Pharmacy) has a falling out with them. **Soon he is mysteriously knifed to death.** The neighbors are cagey and the case goes unsolved. 

* Enter Rajeev Dixit.  A swadeshi and founder of Azadi Bachao Andolan. Ramdev’s interest in entering politics leads to these two becoming incredibly close much to the discomfort of Balakrishna and Ram Bharat

* Meanwhile, his political favors with the Congress masters reap him reward as he wins contracts of Food Processing Plants. But soon, due to not paying workers at Divya Pharmacy minimum wage they draw the ire of CITU. Brinda Karat soon claims that the workers brought her ‘testicles of some sort of wildcat’. Apparently they told her deer horns and human skulls were crushed into the medicines. Though there is no proof to validate this, the samples tested by the Union Health Ministries’ Ayurvedic unit – AYUSH confirmed traces of human and animal DNA. Karat apparently met N.D Tiwari but according to her the minister didn’t budge to take any action

* Soon Ramdev starts to do roadshows across the country and abroad. Patanjali Ayurved Ltd is born over the controversial Divya Pharmacy. And here we see the next mystery. The disappearance of 77 year old TB infested Shankar Mahadev (Ramdev’s Guru). Mahadev was becoming quite vocal and anxious about the venture of Ramdev and his deputies. Police find nothing but a note in his room saying “I have taken some loan from you for this trust but I cannot pay it. Please forgive me. I am leaving”. Ramdev who was on a foreign trip didn’t cut it short as would have been expected. 

* Ramdev and Rajeev Dixit set up a new party – **Bharat Swabhiman Andolan.** 

* The Takeover of Aastha – When SEBI freezes 93% of Aastha’s owners share, sensing an opportunity Ramdev moves in and buys the remaining 7% for 10 crores in installment. The installments were never paid, but the ownership was transferred to Ramdev. Part of this was done in faith. Once the formalities are done, in a confrontational meeting, Ramdev bullies the owner and MD into resignation. Meanwhile, he asks another follower to buy Sanskar channel for him. Which that follower did.

* As mentioned earlier, keeping inline with Ramdev’s political ambitions, Rajeev Dixit and Ramdev became increasingly close much to dismay of Balakrishna and Ram Bharat. Soon, Rajeev Dixit was found dead in a locked bathroom. The hospital said it was cardiac arrest. Ramdev said on television that he had told Rajeev to take care of his health as he had diabetes, BP and heart disease. But Rajeev’s brother Pradeep says that he had no such health problems. Next, Ramdev convinces the family to conduct funeral in Haridwar as Dixit was son of the soil instead of his native Wardha. But as his body was laid for public demonstration, the Bharat Swabhiman Andolan workers were stunned. Dixit’s face was unrecognizable, strange purple and blue. His skin was peeling strangely. There was black, blue blood coming from his nose. Soon there was hue and cry. The Andolan workers wanted to conduct post mortem. Ramdev called a few of them for a personal meeting, confiscated their phones, checked their pens for cameras and told them that post mortem is against **Hindu Dharma.** When they refused to budge, Ramdev agreed but soon went back to the hall ahead of the workers and spoke on microphone ‘Some people have come from Mumbai. They want me to do a post mortem. Such cutting is against Hindu Dharma’. Soon Ramdev’s men got the body ready and set off to cremation ghats.

* Ramdev’s biggest fall came during his participation in the Anna movement. He wanted to use the movement for his political mileage. Hence while the original protesters were focused on a stronger Lokpal bill, Ramdev was more about bringing black money back. So he sat on a fast onto death protest. Meanwhile there was a backdoor meeting with senior Congress members (Pranab Mukerjee, P.K Bansal, Kapil Sibal and Subodh Kant Sahay). He then agreed to something and then went ahead and did the exact opposite. This ired the Congress as at midnight the cops swooped on the protestors with lathi charge. Ramdev of course famously tried to escape dressed in a **white salwar kameez**

* Part of the credit towards the success of Patanjali should go to their ex-CEO – **S.K Patra**. He helped them lay the foundations, setup best practices for what was a highly disoriented company with no ethics or standard operating procedures. Patra also used his connections to stabilize against the witch-hunting on Ramdev’s business enterprises by the Congress Govt. But soon Patra’s influence once again made Balakrishna and Ram Bharat uneasy. Patra was let off after some ugly confrontation with Baba. 

* Today Patanjali is the second largest FMCG company with revenue of **Rs 10561 crores**. Its best selling products are ghee – **Rs 1467 crore**, Dant Kanti toothpaste – Rs 940 crore. But Patanjali ghee isn’t normal ghee but actually white butter which is not really good for health. Caravan has published a transcript from the book on this section - [Link](http://www.caravanmagazine.in/vantage/patanjalis-desi-cow-ghee-even-cow-ghee)

* Part of the reason for Patanjali’s market share is its price. Its below market as Baba believes only in taking a marginal share. But this is also possible because working at Patanjali is considered as **seva** and asking for increments and privileges are frowned upon. Economic Times has published a transcript from the book on this section – [Link](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/fmcg/inside-patanjali-heres-what-life-is-like-in-baba-ramdevs-company/articleshow/59824892.cms) 

* There are a number of violations flagged by FSSAI (Food Safety and Standards Authority of India) including license number fraudulence on Patanjali noodles. A lot of third party agencies have written about the poor conditions and lack of hygiene in the production units.

Ramdev is a businessman, politician and godman rolled into one. He has no doubt helped popularize Yoga and Ayurveda in India. The people who speak to the author are no doubt captivated, influenced and no doubt bullied by him. His close association with BJP government today means none of the open cases would move anytime soon. His target is to get Patanjali to 20,000 crores by 2018-19. And under the environment of nationalistic and swadeshi assertions he very well might do it. 

Finally, I realise that the TL;DR post itself needs a TL;DR. But its quite hard summarizing a book without loosing on intricacies. Hence once again would recommend reading the book.

Edit 2: Woah! Thanks for the Gold kind stranger. Though I would rather have people reading the book.

"A Tale of Rogue Pirates, Ashok Kumars and ISPs caught in the middle: RTI data on court ordered website blocking reveals worrying trends #WhatTheBlock  

https://i.redd.it/0e8et2q1km931.png

### Highlights

* **Background:** As per RTI data from BSNL, 31 cases over two years led to the blocking of more than 4000 websites in India. Most of the cases involve allegations of copyright infringement related to movies. We are making a copy of this response with the text of these orders available. BSNL has only revealed court orders but refuses to provide any directions received from the Central Government for blocking of websites and we will be filing an appeal with the CIC regarding denial of this information.
* **Lack of Due Process:** Our analysis of the court orders reveals four disturbing trends. First, the court orders permit blocking of the entire website, and not just specific URLs which host IP infringing content. Second, courts have passed the buck to ISPs to determine whether blocking websites listed by the plaintiff is necessary to prevent copyright infringement without independently verifying if these websites host infringing content. Third, interim injunctions are granted to block access to websites without providing the website owner an opportunity of being heard. Finally, Ashok Kumar orders which were intended to gather evidence against unnamed defendants are being misused for website blocking.

### Perseverance Pays Off (Partly)

After a long drawn process, BSNL has provided IFF access to court orders directing blocking of websites in 2017 and 2018. We had filed two RTI applications with BSNL on 6 March 2019 seeking information about website blocking orders issued by the Central Government and different courts. Both RTI applications were initially rejected by citing the existence of a fiduciary relationship under Section 8(1)(e) and threat to life and safety of a person under Section 8(1)(g) of the Right to Information Act, 2005. We appealed the rejection of our RTI requests, and we were partly successful because BSNL agreed to provide us access to court orders. However, it has refused to disclose website blocking orders issued by the Central Government and we intend to challenge this before the Central Information Commission (CIC) soon.

### Anatomy of a Website Blocking Court Order

We were provided access to 31 court orders in total. Out of these, 25 orders were passed by the Madras High Court and the remaining 7 orders were passed by the Delhi High Court. Almost all the court orders relate to unlicensed streaming of copyrighted films, TV shows or sports events on websites such as 123 Movies, Pirate Bay, Put Locker, Torrent etc. Approximately 3000-4000 websites were blocked by each order but there is significant overlap in the websites mentioned by different orders.

&amp;#x200B;

We analysed all 31 court orders and discovered four disturbing trends.

***(i) Whole websites, and not specific URLs are being blocked***  
All court orders relating to copyright infringement permit blocking of the whole website, and they do not limit suspension of access to specific URLs which host infringing content. The list of websites is prepared by the plaintiff with the help of paid investigative agencies and it is accepted by the court without any independent scrutiny.  
A notable exception to this trend of blocking whole websites is present in the solitary court order relating to trademark infringement which directs blocking of specific URLs selling infringing products on E-Commerce platforms like Amazon, Flipkart and Snapdeal. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine a scenario where a court would mechanically block access to the whole website of a multi billion dollar giant like Amazon. Unfortunately, file sharing platforms like Torrent which have been characterized as rogue pirates do not receive the same level of consideration.

***(ii) ISPs forced to be Judge, Jury and Executioner***  
Most court orders passed by the Madras High Court put ISPs in a tough spot because they are directed to block websites listed by the plaintiff if it is necessary to prevent copyright infringement. This is unacceptable because ISPs are not capable of making such decisions which require application of judicial mind. Whether blocking a website is necessary to prevent copyright infringement will require the ISP to evaluate the genuineness and imminence of the threat vis a vis each website. Since ISPs do not want to waste their resources on individually verifying whether infringing content exists on the thousands of websites listed by the plaintiff, they will err on the side of caution and block access to everything.  Further, there are several exceptions to copyright infringement such as fair use for educational purposes or criticism, and ISPs cannot be expected to balance competing interests to determine if the exception is applicable.

***(iii) Ex-parte orders are undermining the adversarial basis of our justice system***  
Out of 31 orders in total, 21 orders were passed without any of the defendants or their representatives present. Therefore, there was nobody present during the hearing who could challenge the plaintiff’s version. This is deeply problematic because our justice system follows an adversarial model which believes in discovering the truth through contestation between opposing parties. In the cases before the Delhi High Court, there were four types of defendants: owners of  named websites which are known to host copyright infringing content, owners of unnamed websites which may be hosting copyright infringing content but their identity is not currently known, ISPs and government bodies like Department of Telecom. However, plaintiffs who had filed their copyright infringement suits before the Madras High Court only impleaded ISPs as defendants. This means that owners of websites which are being blocked have not even been brought on record or served notice. If only ISPs are impleaded as defendants, then it is not a genuinely adversarial proceeding because as previously noted, ISPs are business entities which would prefer to err on the side of caution and they will not fight for website owners.

***(iv) Ashok Kumar orders being misutilized for website blocking***  
For everyone who isn’t an intellectual property lawyer, an Ashok Kumar order is a court order which restrains a class of persons whose identity is not yet known from infringing the plaintiff’s rights. These orders are called John Doe orders abroad.

The difference between John Doe orders and website blocking orders has been explained by [**Ananth Padmanabhan writing for CIS**](https://cis-india.org/a2k/blogs/john-doe-orders-isp-blocking-websites-copyright-1):

&gt;*“The most crucial point of distinction between these two types of orders is that while John Doe orders speak to the primary infringer, website blocking orders impose onerous responsibility on the ISP. John Doe orders as used in India thus far have served the purpose of a blanket search and seize mandate to gather evidence of direct infringement. As seen above, the final relief in the suit is granted only against those John Does who are subsequently identified and arrayed as parties to the main suit. Website blocking orders, on the other hand, amount to granting the final relief at the interim stage itself, as access is blocked to web links hosted by unknown persons by taking recourse to the ISP.”*

In some of the court orders that we analysed, the judges have failed to appreciate this distinction, and they have put the cart before the horse by directing the ISPs to block access to any infringing website upon receiving notice of the same from the plaintiff. The ISPs are required to block access even if the owner of the website was not impleaded as a named defendant or mentioned in the list of websites provided by the plaintiff to the court.

### Need for due process and proportionate solutions

On our blog, we have previously written about problems in the website blocking process under the IT Blocking Rules. Most recently, we discussed this issue in the context of [**blocking of the satirical Dowry Calculator website**](https://internetfreedom.in/blocking-of-satirical-dowry-calculator-website-prompts-us-to-take-action-whattheblock-savetheinternet/) for which we had also filed an RTI.

Our analysis of the court orders supplied by BSNL reveals that even when websites are blocked by the judiciary, there is a lack of due process and natural justice. Website owners are not given notice or hearing before grant of interim injunctions. Further, court ordered website blocking is disproportionately broad because it is not limited to specific URLs which host infringing content. File sharing platforms also host legitimate content and cutting off access to the entire website is akin to throwing the baby out with the bathwater.

The most troubling trend is the concentration of power in the hands of ISPs who are expected to block websites which may or may not be mentioned in the plaint based on whether it is ""necessary"" to prevent infringement. This means that our fundamental right to free speech which is guaranteed by Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution is left at the mercy of overly cautious and business minded ISPs. As internet users, we are often left wondering why certain websites have been blocked because the notices displayed are cryptic and inconsistent, and they do not disclose reasons for suspension of access. This lack of transparency directly impacts our right to receive information which is also a part of Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution.

Filing RTIs has been an important part of IFF’s strategy to unearth information which concretely demonstrates lack of due process and transparency in the website blocking process. If you have ideas about other RTIs we should file, write to us!

Though I've multiple concerns at this point, it would be great if anyone can share their experience with the hospital. Particularly, we are interested in understanding the a) staff behavior at the hospital (think giving attention to the patient, quick response time for emergencies etc.), b) facilities and infrastructure, c) cleanliness and associated safety norms, and d) fairness in pricing.

"I'm a male[23] need advice. Around the age of nine, I believed my father was the richest man in town for he would say things like, ""I smoke more cigarettes than what you make in a month "". That is a really obnoxious thing to say to somebody but as a nine year old I thought that's what rich people say and the neighborhood where I grew up in which is a little town in the Northeast, is full of gamblers, and unfortunately, my father was one.

My father worked in the department of agriculture but couldn't save none. When I was around 14 years old, my father sold our house for only five lakh rupees, my mother battled everyday, reached out to people to convince him not to but nobody helped and I didn't understand anything about it, neither did my elder sister who was 17 at the time.

He never encouraged us to study and the neighborhood didn't inspire it either and consequently we hardly cleared our matriculation. After that, no college for us.

It was around 2012 when I got my first cell phone which was a Chinese phone with a 2g network (took 40 mins or something to download a 4mb song), with that phone, I taught myself everything I know, I can safely say I learned from that phone more than what I learned in school. 

I started confronting my father when I turned 17 or something about what he did to us and he always said things like, ""I don't earn for you, I earn for myself"", ""when I die, you'll get enough money from the government to build a house and live happily"".

Which wasn't true. My father died back in 2017 and now we're told to leave the quarter. They let us live for two years but not anymore.

I was never forced to go out and work and with a 10 pass certificate, I'm not going to find any work either. Shit has hit the fan. We got some 15 lakh from the office and paid 2.5 lakh for some loan he had, now with that little budget we can't imagine building a house in this age, plus my sister is unmarried.

I love my mother so much, I loved my father as well despite what kind of a person he was, he was my father nevertheless. But my mother, she's my life. If it wasn't for my mother, i would've ended this life.

My relatives stopped calling us a year later my father's death lest we ask them for help.

It's just 3 of us now, nobody comes to our house anymore, my father's work colleagues who used to treat me like a son now passes me by like I'm some stranger.

Life is bleak with no hope in sight. I'm soon to be 24 with no prior experience in work. I've been told to move out of the town but i can't imagine living my mother and sister in a place where there's no one to take care of them.

I dream about 3 of us killing ourselves. I hope it doesn't come to pass.

My father never let me work, not even go to market and get groceries because he thought I'm a fool, i can't use money. I squandered my life away. I work in our locality but it's not work in the traditional sense, i just help out people for little to no money.

What can I do? I don't hope to make my mother proud, I just want a stable life and always be there for my mother.

My nearest city is Guwahati. There I might my some work but again, can't leave them here and I a city like Guwahati, where average rent is 10k+, all of us can't move there either.

How do I make thing work, how do I make myself work?

How do you go out and find work? I have no real world experience. I used to have a really good friend, thought he was my best friend but that's not true. He stopped hanging out with me.

I play ludo with my mother and sister to keep them distracted of our imminent dark days.

"Career/Education Advice First of all I wanna thank everyone who took time out to read this post and helped me out...

I have made huge mistakes in my life where my engineering is concerned. Got addicted to online gaming, kinda fell into a depression and already wasted three years of my life. Got detained coz of attendance. Now, I'm planning to go back and sit my fourth year of engineering so that I can have my degree. 

That being said, I don't think I wanna continue studying mechanical (I'm sure I can self-study starting from inter-physics, inter-mathematics concepts but I don't feel like doing that). 

However, based on other people's advice and my desire into doing something else tangible and 'job secure', I wanna get into something computer science related. Idk shit about this but I've seen the word 'coding' thrown around a lot. 

Now, I have one year to make myself employable in this field. Will I have to study four years worth of what computer science engineering students study? If not, what should I study? I know it's a pipe dream to learn everything in an year, I just wanna plan like I wanna be job ready in an year and then study on own pace.

Is CS a good career choice? If it is, what specifically should I start studying? Is there any specific beginner books you recommend that'll help me get started?

TL;Dr: Fucked up engineering and now I wanna learn computer sciences? What exactly should I learn and what beginner books should I buy?",AskIndia

"During lockdown, Uttarakhand CM (on Amit Shah's orders) arranged 28 buses to transport 1800 Gujarati devotees stranded in Haridwar back to Ahmedabad. Uttarakhand workers in Ahmedabad were then duped of Rs. 18000 and stranded midway when they tried to use these buses to return home. Link to the story: https://www.bhaskar.com/db-original/news/amit-shah-vijay-rupani-latest-updates-on-gujarat-pilgrims-return-from-haridwar-rishikesh-over-coronavirus-lockdown-127094521.html

Since the story is in Hindi, here's a summary of the events as reported by Dainik Bhaskar

>गुजरात के मुख्यमंत्री के सचिव अश्वनी कुमार ने एक न्यूज एजेंसी को बताया- ‘गुजरात के अलग-अलग जिलों के करीब 1800 लोग हरिद्वार में फंसे हुए थे। केंद्रीय मंत्री मनसुखभाई मांडविया और मुख्यमंत्री विजय रूपाणी के विशेष प्रयासों से इन लोगों को वहां से निकालकर इनके घर पहुंचाने की व्यवस्था की गई।’ इसी व्यवस्था के चलते उत्तराखंड परिवहन की कई गाड़ियां हरिद्वार से अहमदाबाद पहुंची थी। दिलचस्प है कि ये काम इतनी गोपनीयता से किया गया कि उत्तराखंड के परिवहन मंत्री तक को ये खबर नहीं लगी कि उनके विभाग की कई गाड़ियां लॉकडाउन के दौरान कई राज्यों की सीमाओं को पार करते हुए 1200 किलोमीटर के सफर पर निकल चुकी हैं।

Ashwani Kumar, Secretary to the Chief Minister of Gujarat, told a news agency - ""Around 1800 people from different districts of Gujarat were stranded in Haridwar. With the special efforts of Union Minister Mansukhbhai Mandaviya and Chief Minister Vijay Rupani, arrangements were made to evacuate these people to their homes.” As a result of this arrangement, many vehicles of Uttarakhand Transport reached Ahmedabad from Haridwar. Interestingly, this work was done with such secrecy that even the transport minister of Uttarakhand did not get the news that many buses of his department had traversed distances of nearly 1200 km crossing the borders of many states during lockdown.

>27 मार्च को जारी एक आदेश से मालूम पड़ता है कि उत्तराखंड परिवहन की ये गाड़ियां सीधे प्रदेश के मुख्यमंत्री कार्यालय के निर्देशों के तहत गुजरात भेजी गई थीं। इनका उद्देश्य हरिद्वार में फंसे गुजरात के लोगों को उनके घर पहुंचाना था। वापस लौटते हुए यही गाड़ियां वहां फंसे उत्तराखंड के लोगों को लेकर आ सकती थी, लेकिन ऐसा कोई भी आदेश उत्तराखंड सरकार की ओर से जारी नहीं हुआ।

An order issued on March 27 shows that these vehicles of Uttarakhand Transport were sent directly to Gujarat *under the instructions of the Chief Minister's Office*. Their purpose was to bring the people of Gujarat trapped in Haridwar to their homes. **While returning, the same vehicles could have brought the people of Uttarakhand stranded there, but no such order was issued by the Uttarakhand government.**

Workers from Uttarakhand (working in Ahmedabad) who wished to return home during the lockdown came to know about these buses from their friends back home. 

>मुकेश कुमार बताते हैं- ‘अगली सुबह यानी 29 मार्च को करीब 10 बजे हम सब लोग इन बसों के पास पहुंच गए। हम 13 साथी एक बस थे। हमारी बस के ड्राइवर ने फिर हमसे कहा कि तुम्हें ऋषिकेश तक का कुल 18 हजार रुपए किराया चुकाना होगा। ये हमें अजीब तो लगा लेकिन हमारे पास कोई विकल्प भी नहीं था। मजबूरी थी इसलिए हम तैयार हो गए और हम 13 लोगों ने मिलकर तुरंत ही 18 हजार रुपए ड्राइवर को थमा दिए। हमें लगा था कि चलो इस मुश्किल वक्त में हम कम से कम किसी भी तरह अपने घर तो पहुंच जाएंगे। लेकिन वो भी नहीं हुआ।’

Mukesh Kumar says- ""The next morning, on March 29, around 10 o'clock we all reached near these buses. We were 13 companions a bus. **The driver of our bus again told us that you have to pay a total fare of 18 thousand rupees up to Rishikesh.** We found it strange but we had no choice. We were helpless, so we got ready and we immediately gave 18 thousand rupees to the driver. We thought that at least during this difficult time, we will somehow reach home. But that didn't happen either. '

>मुकेश और उनके साथियों को उत्तराखंड परिवहन की इन बसों ने अहमदाबाद से बैठा तो लिया लेकिन उत्तराखंड पहुंचने से पहले ही रात के अंधेरे में किसी को राजस्थान तो किसी को हरियाणा में ही उतार दिया। 

Instead of Uttarakhand, these buses dropped Mukesh and his companions midway. Some were dropped off in Harayana, and some in Rajasthan. 


> बताया जा रहा है कि गुजरात के ये तमाम लोग किसी धार्मिक अनुष्ठान में शामिल होने हरिद्वार पहुंचे थे। प्रधानमंत्री और गृह मंत्री के अपने प्रदेश से आए इन लोगों को उनका करीबी भी बताया जा रहा है। गुजरात के मुख्यमंत्री के सचिव अश्वनी कुमार के आधिकारिक बयान से भी इतना तो साफ होता ही है कि जहां देशभर में लाखों लोग यहां-वहां फंसे हुए हैं, वहीं हरिद्वार में फंसे इन लोगों को सीधा गृह मंत्री के निजी हस्तक्षेप के बाद विशेष व्यवस्था करके निकाला गया है।

It is being said that all these people from Gujarat had reached Haridwar to participate in some religious ritual. These people are supposedly close to the Prime Minister and the Home Minister. **It is also clear from the official statement of Ashwani Kumar, Secretary to the Chief Minister of Gujarat, that while millions of people are trapped here and there across the country, these people trapped in Haridwar were taken out after special intervention by the Home Minister directly.**

>दूसरी तरफ मुकेश कुमार जैसे लोग है, जिन्होंने अपने प्रदेश की गाड़ियों को आता देख अपने घर लौट पाने की उम्मीद पाली थी, लेकिन वो अब तक भी अधर में लटके हुए हैं।

On the other hand there are people like Mukesh Kumar, who had expected to be able to return to their homes after seeing the buses coming from their state, but they have been stranded.

**Banks - Mo’ Money, No Problems**

Two major private sector banks, Axis and HDFC, reported results for the quarter ending June and it’s a mixed bag. The bad loans crisis [continued](http://www.financialexpress.com/industry/banking-finance/axis-bank-q1-results-net-profit-bad-loans-on-july-22-2016/325755/) to hit Axis Bank where profits fell by 21%. But HDFC Bank, which mostly focuses on retail borrowers, [managed](http://in.reuters.com/article/hdfc-bank-results-idINKCN1010ML) to entirely miss the crisis as profits were up by 20%. However, the bag isn’t so mixed when it comes to public sector banks which are riddled with problems. The government’s got 99 problems, and 98 of them probably involve the banking sector in one way or another. Now, one way to solve problems is to just throw money at the problem. And 13 public sector banks just [received](http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/govt-allocates-rs-22915-cr-for-psu-bank-re-capitalization_7065221.html) about ₹22,915 crore of cash from the government. A back of the envelope calculation says if they had delivered all that cash physically, it would weigh about 275 kgs. Yes, I did the math. After reserving a lot of money to treat the bad loans problem, the banks didn’t have much remaining to lend out to borrowers. And if banks stop lending money, the entire economy grinds to a halt. So the new capital given by the government is supposed to help them get back into the lending game again. The largest recipient of this capital infusion was our largest bank, the State Bank of India that got about ₹7,575 crore. However, this is only a “capital infusion” and definitely not a “bailout”. Who even said bailout? There’s no bailout here. What bailout?

**ELI5 - GST**

GST - You know it’s a thing. But you don’t have a single clue what it’s about. The only time you hear about it is while changing channels on the TV. And from your drunk uncle at wedding receptions who thinks he’s an expert in politics. The Goods and Services Tax is probably the most important tax reform of this decade. It replaces a whole bunch of indirect taxes such as the VAT, Service Tax or Excise Duty. So instead of paying ten taxes at ten places, you only pay one tax at one place. And cutting down on that paperwork starts a domino effect of good things for the economy. At least that’s the theory. But the bill has been stuck in Rajya Sabha for a long time now. So what’s the big hold up? Political parties have been negotiating the finer details of the bill and the negotiations are taking a little more time than everybody expected. Some sore points of disagreement are whether to place a maximum limit of 18% above which the GST tax rate cannot be raised, whether to levy a 1% surcharge on interstate trade and how to resolve any disputes in the process. But now, if you feel like you aren’t getting enough of our beloved parliamentarians that are so hard at work solving our problems in penthouses all around Delhi, then fear no more. Because the government is [planning](http://zeenews.india.com/news/india/gst-hopes-brighten-as-congress-signals-support-bjp-ready-for-debate-in-rajya-sabha_1908866.html) a 5-hour-long debate in the Rajya Sabha aiming to resolve all disputes and pass the bill once and for all. That’s right, back to back five hours of bickering old men in white clothes - without any commercial breaks.

**Tesla to go desi?**

The pollution in Delhi has reached such an alarming level that if a Delhi resident starts smoking 10 packs of cigarettes a day and garnishing his food with powered nicotine while sleeping in a chamber full of passive tobacco smoke, he’ll probably still die of asthma from the polluted air before the lung cancer gets to him. And then there’s Delhi CM Mr. Kejriwal who recently hinted at the possibility of the torturous odd-even rule returning back to Delhi during the upcoming winters to curb pollution. What the city clearly needs is a whole bunch of emission-free electric cars. And accordingly, the government’s making moves to get Tesla, the car company famous for its electric cars to come to India. Apart from offering to promote joint ventures between Tesla and Indian car companies, the government is even [offering](http://tech.firstpost.com/news-analysis/tesla-and-make-in-india-a-roadway-to-cleaner-and-greener-india-but-how-soon-326205.html) Tesla land near major ports so it can Make in India and export to other Asian countries as well. However, the pipe dream of driving a Tesla down the national highways is unlikely to come true for at least a few years. Until then, we’ve got to find other ways to reduce pollution. Such as banning all diesel vehicles older than 10 years, which is what the National Green Tribunal just did. NGT, a top environmental court, has [directed](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-autos-court-idUSKCN0ZY12P) Delhi transport authorities to de-register any diesel vehicles older than 10 years, and car companies couldn’t be happier.

~~**Tollywoodonomics**~~  **Kollywoodonomics**

Rajinikanth, the Amitabh Bachchan of the South, was out with his latest movie *Kabali*, which opened last Friday in 6,500 theaters, many of which were sold out for the entire weekend. In the movie industry, you’re only as good as your last flop - and in Rajini’s case, his last movie was *Lingaa* and before that, *Kochadaiiyaan* - both of which - well, let's just say that they haven’t exactly been Spielberg material. So you’d think producers would think twice before betting on this next film - but this Rajini we are talking about. He doesn’t follow the laws of economics. The laws of economics follow Ra... okay, yeah, those jokes stopped being funny 10 years ago. But still, people literally pour milk on huge cutouts of this guy. So producers went all in and funded Kabali with a budget of ₹110 crore. Here’s the kicker - the movie had already [earned](http://www.firstpost.com/bollywood/how-rajinikanths-kabali-has-earned-rs-200-crore-days-before-its-release-2902140.html) ₹200 crore even before being released. Music rights, overseas rights, satellite rights and all other kinds of rights had already earned the movie a ton of cash before being released. How much did Rajini make off the movie? The actor was reportedly [paid](http://www.catchnews.com/regional-cinema/revealed-this-is-how-much-rajinikanth-charged-for-kabali-movie-news-rajinikanth-kabali-fees-revealed-1469024603.html) ₹35 crore as acting fees plus he’s set to receive another ₹45 crore from first week collections of the movie at the box office. Rajini being Rajini, theaters were sold out but prices for tickets in black ranged up to ₹1,500 with reports saying fans were ready to pay as much as ₹5,000 for tickets. All of this only points to one thing - at 65-years old, Rajini’s still got some swag.

* The latest version of Fortune magazine’s famous list of 500 top companies in the world was published last week. While the list features companies that are the crème de la crème of the world’s companies, much like the Olympic medal rankings, it is dominated by western multinationals with a few Indian companies here and there. Specifically, seven Indian companies. But the three top [ranked](https://www.scoopwhoop.com/These-Are-The-Seven-Indian-Which-Companies-Which-Made-It-To-Fortune-500-List/) are - Indian Oil (161st), Reliance (215th) and Tata Motors (226th). 

* Every e-commerce company in India needs a payment processor/digital wallet to make transactions go smoothly. For this exact purpose, Amazon acquired Emvantage, Snapdeal owns Freecharge and Paytm is a digital payment franchise in itself. So, of course Flipkart would want it’s own toy to play with. After acquiring PhonePe (a payments startup) this April, Flipkart is [investing](http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2016/07/21/why-flipkart-is-building-a-670-crore-digital-payments-business/) an additional ₹670 crore in the company which is expected to start processing digital payments on Flipkart, Myntra and its logistics service, eKart in the next few weeks.

* ICICI Prudential Life Insurance company has filed the paperwork for an IPO that will most likely launch by the end of this year. The company is set to [make](http://in.reuters.com/article/icici-prudential-ipo-idINKCN0ZY0EL) records by raising over ₹5,000 crore in what will be the biggest IPO in six years. Other notable IPOs of the year include L&T Infotech and Vodafone.

* The long-standing drought has hit rural India the hardest where villagers are being forced to cut back on expenses. Reports suggest that rural India has [elected](http://www.thequint.com/india/2016/07/12/not-all-is-cool-with-the-cola-phone-companies-are-pleased-though-rural-india-coca-cola-pepsico-telecom-companies) to cut expenses by not buying things like cola, candy, biscuits and chocolates. However, mobile internet packs have stood the test of drought to become best-sellers across rural India. Which, I believe, can be taken as conclusive evidence that even farmers in far-reaching corners of rural India love browsing aww-worthy cat photos on the internet. Meanwhile, Coca-Cola, the hardest hit company, is wiping its tears of sadness with the $1.4 billion it earned in profits just last quarter.

High inflation is one of the worst things that can happen to the Indian middle class. As in the type of middle class that earns way less than ₹1.6 lakhs per month. There’s food inflation, price inflation, fuel inflation, netflix is raising prices.. And now, there’s pocket money inflation. A 29-city survey of nearly 7,000 kids aged between 4 to 14 and their parents [reveals](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/spend/kids-pocket-money-up-100-since-2012-turner-international-india-study/articleshow/53238075.cms) that the average pocket money given to kids has shot up by 100% since 2012, and currently stands at ₹555 per month.  

If the Gods know everything in the universe, supposedly they would also know about things like earnings per share or book value vs. market value, which would make them great investors. Last week, the famous Siddhivinayak Temple in Mumbai announced that it has [started](http://www.livemint.com/Money/DaYZSn2IV92xn094xuZsTP/Mumbais-Siddhivinayak-Temple-will-take-shares-as-donations.html) accepting shares of listed companies, mutual fund units and bonds as donations, instead of the usual cash or gold/silver. The temple receives about ₹75 crore of donations in cash and kind annually, which is entirely tax-free. Now, Lord Shiva isn’t just the destroyer of the worlds, he might even be a shareholder of Infosys.

Korea is testing more than 7000 per million.

Regarding the Tableeghi jamaat incident in Delhi, few points

1. The gathering happened much before the lockdown was announced
2. Once the lockdown was announced the gathering wanted to disperse and asked the sdm for vehicle passes. The sdm did not respond.
3. Foreign visitors allowed into the gathering without proper checks. They were the source of infection.
4. Once infected people were found in the gathering why were they all not quarantined by the administration. Why were they allowed to return to their own places before 2 weeks?

After the above incident, the ruling politicians and there IT cell have worked very hard to create the narrative that Muslims are the reason for the spread of corona cases in India. The total lack of preparedness from the government is being glossed over.

Old and out-of-context videos are being shared to demonize the Muslim community. https://altnews.in is filled with so many examples where the facts have been unearthed behind fake videos on WhatsApp and Facebook.

The above was for context

I made a comment in my old friends WhatsApp group that with the April 5, 9 p.m. details a Jalao ""initiative"", corona would surely be gone. With sarcasm.

The response that I got had enough proof that my well educated friends had totally fallen for fake news and truly hated the Muslim community from their gut. A Muslim man licking fruits to spread corona. A Muslim man spitting on police. All of these have been debunked on detail on alt news. But the recipients of these fake videos totally believe them. For them opIndia, WhatsApp and Facebook are like the gospel.

The amount of poison they spewed was phenomenal. When I engaged with fact checks, the response that I got was

I'd rather worry about my future than think of fully utilising my data package for the day.

This was my experience with ""friends"" of twenty years.

How did we come to this?

A wise friend told me that if you want to remain friends on WhatsApp then better not to discuss religion and politics. Maybe he was right.

Maybe this fake news shitstorm has truly blinded well educated individuals, for whom bigotry has become second nature now.

"PM Modi asks for focused effort to achieve $5 trillion economy Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said that the  fundamentals of the Indian economy are strong and it has the capacity to  bounce back.     

The Prime Minister seems to have taken charge of the efforts to revive the economy.

Over  the past few days, the Prime Minister has held as many as 12  brainstorming meetings with different stakeholders over various issues  affecting the economy and to thrash out appropriate policy interventions  in the upcoming Budget.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi interacted  with economists and entrepreneurs from different fields on the broad  theme of economic growth at NITI Aayog in New Delhi.

"Vanakkam! Updates on the Aadhaar-social media linkage and encryption PIL before the Madras HC  

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/0remvkhc48c31.png

As some of you may remember, the Madras High Court had permitted IFF to intervene in an ongoing public interest litigation regarding linking of Aadhaar with social media accounts. You can read more about why we decided to intervene in this case [**here**](https://internetfreedom.in/aadhaar-linking/). There was a hearing in the matter today, i.e. 24 July 2019, and IFF was represented by its legal team consisting of Suhrith Parthasarthy, Arun Mohan and Surasika, with our Executive Director, Apar Gupta also being present in person.  


### What is at stake?

This case is extremely important because the Hon’ble High Court is considering a wide remit of issues, and not just Aadhaar and social media linking.  These include encryption, intermediary liability and use of automated tools to take down illegal content.  


The outcome of this litigation could lead to a change in the product design of major social media platforms because law enforcement agencies want the Hon’ble High Court to direct these companies to devise a mechanism to trace the originator of a message. In this regard, a specific proposal has been made by Dr. V. Kamakoti who is a Professor at IIT Madras to include the phone number of the originator of a message whenever a message is forwarded.   


In its written submission to the Hon’ble High Court, IFF has emphasized that any restrictions on the use of social media platforms must be proportionate and they should arise from a deliberative and consultative process that takes into account the concerns of all stakeholders. We have highlighted how changing the product design of social media platforms to include the phone number of the originator of the message would undermine the freedom of speech of internet users. Anonymity is an important part of freedom of speech because otherwise, individuals would be too reluctant to discuss controversial subjects in the public domain. The right to anonymous speech is especially important for whistleblowers, abuse survivors, activists and others belonging to marginalized groups who may face harassment if their identity was disclosed.   


### What happened at today’s hearing?

Today, senior legal counsels appearing for WhatsApp and Facebook made extensive arguments on the central point of traceability. On our part, we filed and placed a substantive response which addresses a broad range of issues which have arisen including concerns regarding digital surveillance, encryption and content takedowns. During oral arguments, based on submissions made by the lawyers for social media platforms, the Hon’ble High Court expressed the view that it may even examine the existing level of compliance and legal vacuum under the IT (Intermediary Guidelines) Rules.   


Prof. Kamakoti’s technical inputs which formed part of the Government’s common report have been directed to be filed by the Hon’ble High Court. This promises to be interesting and we will respond to it. The next date of hearing in this case is 21 and 22 August 2019.

"Watched 'Kaala' (2018) starring Rajnikanth and I think it is one of the most revolutionary movies from Indian cinema. Just watched yesterday after recommendation from a friend and got blown by the hidden symbolism and references which pans all issues and the roots behind  which our country is facing .
It is one of the few movies where you need to watch it frame by frame to understand the metaphor which the director wants to convey albeit in a mass movie style.


Rajinikanth and his aura might be at the centre, but the focus is Ranjith’s ideology that operates in the nooks and corners of the screen where our eyes might not usually wander

The film opens to crowded bylanes of Dharavi, with a voiceover detailing the struggles of its inhabitants, the “urban poor”, who were jotted on the margins of the success story of Mumbai and just like that, with the flip of a page, forgotten. Numerous buildings will come up in Dharavi, its denizens are told, bringing modernity and prosperity to their lives. But its people don’t want a 225-square foot cell masquerading as advancement; they want their own freedoms.


It is an anti caste and Ambedkarite movie but unlike other movies  the protagonist kaala here is a fighter who wears all black which he calls the colour of struggle,of hard work. 

The antagonist Hari Dev (Nana patekar )is a Modi like figure who consider himself as the saviour Rama ,dresses all white  and  fantasize  a clean,digital  and pure India at the expense of decimating the lower class. 

Kaala represents the dark, poor precarious world whereas Hari Dada’s neat, clean, white milieu is used as a mask to hide his malicious criminal psyche.

Kaala delves into lives and cultures, and shows us that contrary to the perception of ‘unclean’ – if at all there is anything ‘clean’ about the Indian city, it is thanks to them. The film, in the spirit of Baldwin, repeats that the way people treat you is testament to their own fear and inhumanity, and not your own inferiority.

The colour of black ( Periyar) ,Blue ( Ambedkar) ,Red( Karl marx) is beautifully portrayed in the climax .

Kaala is not only a display of alternative social symbols but it also builds a radical political alternative against the bourgeois rightwing politics of the current times. It showcases the growing democratic consciousness of the Lower Castes, religious minorities, women and other working class people in the depraved land of Dharavi. The films at its core represent the idea of democratic socialism. It retold the epical battle between the haves and have not’s in an actual sociological space",CAA-NRC-NPR

"Qnet...Dnt tell I didn't tell you Some of us might have heard of Qnet and for those who haven't this thread is for you guys

This actually happened like a year ago and I had totally forgotten about it till someone pitched me Qnet again a few days ago.

Back in 2018, I had quit my cushy job and just about started my own startup - so money was tight, I was highly motivated and looking to jump at any opportunity and this is when a guy I used to work with messaged me and told me he had this insane opportunity for me. He said it was a limited-time opportunity and he was recommending me to his mentors - this is where I started feeling like this is an MLM pitch or some sort of scam but given that I had always known him to be an honest fellow I gave him the benefit of the doubt.

He scheduled a meet with some senior and this was in Sheraton, Delhi. So, first I meet this lady who says she's been working with this eCommerce/ networking company for past 2-3 years and here is the gist of the talk I had with her

1. She earns lakhs by working only a few weeks of the month, travels the world when she fancies, blah blah stuff like that.
2. I heard more irrelevant business jargons in 45 mins from her than I did in my 2 years of b-school.
3. Tried to discuss on a few of the business jargons she had been throwing around and I realised she only knows the terms and not what they mean.
4. So in 45 mins, I hear everything from her own success story to random stuff, but not a single word of what the opportunity is about or what the revenue model is - only that the more hours I put in, the more money I make and the returns are like 500%.
5. She says she liked my personality, motivation and whatnot and would let me know if I qualified for the program. Then she goes on for 10-15 minutes to say how CEOs, VPs, etc. are lining up for this opportunity and even shows me her contact list saying all these people have been after her life so that she lets me in on this once in a lifetime opportunity. By now I had figured out this was some good scam and cursing myself for taking an uber instead of taking the metro. Shes like she will recommend me but chances are 50-50.
6. Guess what? 10 minutes later, a very senior person in the business happens to be coming to this very hotel and that she can arrange for me to meet with him now only and all I had to do was impress him.

Part 2: Meeting the so-called bigshot

1. So I had earlier talked about my love for travelling and building my own business in marketing. So, the guy tells me that he has travelled over 50 countries last year and the lakhs of rupees he makes from this business helped him to secure his own passion project.
2. Apparently he was earning 5 lakhs per month in the IT industry before quitting his job. But despite me repeatedly asking he did not tell me which company he used to work for or even what role he was working in.
3. By now, I am just enjoying my snacks and trying to see how far these scammers will go to sell me whatever it is they are trying to sell.
4. The guy also realised his sales pitch was not working and so he tried to convince me that I was morally responsible for my parents having to work in their old age when I should be able to provide for them and this opportunity was the only way I was going to do that
5. I repeatedly asked him what organization I would be working for and he evaded the question every single time. The only thing he said was that **Microsoft** handles their paperwork and hence, they are a trustworthy company.
6. At the very end, he casually mentions that fees for xyz stuff are **INR 1,70,000** and that I would be making that back in the next few weeks only.

Thanked him, finished my snacks and said I would think about it. I very nearly wanted to go full ballistic and let him know what a load of bs he had been going on about.

Also, they did ask for my PAN CARD photo which I said I didn't have on me and said I will send it once I get back, which I never did.

As for the guy who got me into this entire waste of time, I see him post motivational posts on social media daily, post pics of trips to exotic places and him riding inexpensive cars. He did try to pressure me into paying up the money and all he said was that the company name was QNET and nothing about what they did. A quick google search was enough to verify my doubts.

"Indian banking system under attack! I have a strong reason to believe that Indian banking is under systematic attack. The shit hole goes very deep and the problem is compounded by the fact that the media ""tones"" down its coverage (obviously to avoid panic). There are malware attacks (on ICICI which is siphoning of email contacts and sending its account holders phishing emails), Advanced persistent threats on Axis Bank (they disclosed this to RBI), ATM frauds as in State Bank of India and multiple accounts of phishing attacks on individuals. Union Bank has also suffered cyber heist. 

A worrying trend is by use of SIM Swap. Fraudsters get your personal details (easily available through WhatsApp), your details through identity thefts and blocking your actual SIM's so that you cannot receive the SMS alerts. 

Two factor authentication is very basic (dependent on passwords alone) which again can be easily retrieved because most users re-use their passwords. 

Its getting scarier and worsened. 


A simple remedy as of now is to change PIN of your existing debit card and get ""CHIP and PIN"" card which secures transaction because they cannot be replicated easily. Of course, moving away from WhatsApp is a sensible decision (use BBM/ Threema) so that your identity details through phone numbers is not compromised. 

Edit 1: In response to ""proofs"" and so called ""click bait""; here are the links. Please connect the dots. 
Further, BBM and Threema allow you to be anonymous because outside the system, they can't do anything to your PINS. :-)
