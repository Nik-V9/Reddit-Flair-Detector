Scheduled,[AskIndia] Indigo cancelled flight less than 8 hour due to bad weather before the scheduled departure without providing alternate flight. Can I claim compensation other than cancelled flight refund?,"I had Indigo flight from HYD-BOM on 14th Dec @ 12:25 AM. On 13th around 4:30PM Indigo sent SMS informing me my flight is cancelled due to bad weather in Delhi. I had another flight from BOM so I had to book another flight HYD -BOM which was of around 17K Rs.  Indigo denied any compensation when I contacted their customer care and in Airsewa APP they closed the ticket citing as the weather was bad and it falls under the category ""situation is not in their control"" and they cannot provide any compensation.  Should I go ahead and file complain in consumer court ? Has anyone had any similar experience and able to get any compensation from the airline other than cancelled flight refund?"

Scheduled,"Hydroxychloroquine now a schedule H1 drug, can be sold on prescription only",
Scheduled,Seattle city council becomes the first US legislative body to pass a resolution against CAA. Full video of the hearing and the vote that followed.,"This resolution was tabled on January 21st because some of the council members thought they needed to do more research after receiving an email from the Council General of India. 

It was scheduled for a hearing and vote at 2pm today. It has been a long and emotional day. There were around 200-300 people supporting the resolution and probably not more than 80 who were supporting CAA and against the resolution. They were in minority but were the loudest and were there at the city hall since 7 in the morning. Since they were first in line, they got to register for the hearing first and got the opportunity to speak. [Here is the full video of the hearing and the vote.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwygRQ6oXuQ)

One after the other they came and spoke lies about how CAA has nothing to do with Indians. They talked about how minorities are being prosecuted in Pakistan/Bangladesh, how women are being forcefully converted or raped in these countries, or how minorities went from 25% to 5% in these countries(without any source for that information). Some argued that Seattle should deal with its own problems of homelessness, drugs and crime instead of ""falling prey to hate-mongering"". One person even claimed that there is a [genocide of Hindus going on in India and the population of Hindus went down to 65%.](https://youtu.be/WwygRQ6oXuQ?t=1920) Many people laughed at that. Some accused the council member Kshama Sawant and her political aspirations and her ""ulterior motives"" behind this resolution. Some even went on to claim that all these protests against CAA are sponsored by Pakistan/ISI. [And when there was finally a group to speak in favor of the resolution, the bhakts started heckling and shouting at them and the the hearing was suspended,](https://youtu.be/WwygRQ6oXuQ?t=2798) which they knew would happen. When the hearing was resumed it was back to them and their lies.

After the public hearing, the council member Sawant [gave an amazing speech supporting the resolution](https://youtu.be/WwygRQ6oXuQ?t=4463) and she was constantly being heckled. And then there was [this](https://youtu.be/WwygRQ6oXuQ?t=5106) comment from another council member who could see the bigotry through all the comments made by the bhakts.

In the end, truth prevailed and the council members voted 5 out of 5 in favor of the resolution. 

Right when it was apparent that the resolution was going to be passed, the bhakts started [creating a ruckus](https://youtu.be/WwygRQ6oXuQ?t=5574) and after multiple warnings, security was called and they were asked to leave the hall. The way the acted was embarrassing to say the least."

Scheduled,[R] Let's discuss the BJP and Congress Manifestos,"# Resources

**[BJP Manifesto](https://www.bjp.org/en/manifesto2019)**

**[Congress Manifesto](https://manifesto.inc.in/en/)**

The BJP Manifesto is available in Hindi and English, while the Congress Manifesto is available in Hindi, English, Odia, Telugu, Kannada, Marathi, Punjabi, Assamese.

I've provided a few highlights from both the manifestos. The manifestos are large and it is not possible to cover all the points. I have covered the points which I believe are easier to judge on implementability.

# Observations
* Congress manifesto is longer.

Scheduled,Will India (and our highly questionable work culture) benefit from a 4 days working \ 3 days weekly off schedule?,"This experiment has been adopted intermittently in many parts of the world across many companies - recently it found huge success in Japan at Microsoft:

https://soranews24.com/2019/11/03/microsoft-japans-experiment-with-3-day-weekend-boosts-worker-productivity-by-40-percent/

I think it's a well known, well documented reality of our times that work balance life is highly trash in India.

Work environments are largely toxic too due to a culmination of many internal & external factors.

The commute eats into a substantial time of the day for most folks as well on top of this. 

Are there any organizations in India who have already implemented a 4 day week - or are such plans in the pipeline for companies?

What are your thoughts on such an initiative - does anyone reckon it will succeed here?"

Scheduled,"What are we doing parents, teachers and tutors?","So I am an independent education consultant from India - who has worked with kids in gaining admissions to top colleges in the US (Cornell, Brown, UPenn), Canada (McGill, Toronto, UBC), and UK (Imperial, Cambridge, Warwick). The past three years that I have spent doing this has brought me closer to the realities of teenhood in modern India. I have become increasingly disillusioned by the number of expectations we have from the young ones! I struggle to schedule calls and meetings with high school students because their schedules are so busy! I have even had calls at midnight in some cases as that's the only time the kid could find.

I am not even sure where this spiral is leading to? The kids are coached at every stage and even overcoached with tuitions starting as early as second grade and parents fretting about if their 4 years old can code?! As someone who grew up in the 90s in India - with a reasonable level of education pressure at the hands of the Indian education system - I sometimes wish I could put a pause on this madness and let the kids be! We have a generation that doesn't know the respite of the languid summer days, the hours spent in a limited screen environment just mucking about the house making scrapbooks, getting dirty or doing whatever the hell WE wanted. Now I know I am going down the rose-tinted glasses route - but as kid boredom leads to discovery. The afternoon I spent going door to door in our building trying to sell peanuts that I found in the house (to the utter embarrassment of my middle-class service job parents) taught me things, the time I spent trying to teach my brother math just because he was a ready audience meant something. What did that have to do with going abroad at 17 for me? NOTHING! But they are the fondest memories that continue to affect my well being even decades later.

A key part of me working with kids is exploring their dreams and aspirations when it comes to going to college abroad and when I start throwing around words like dreams and aspirations and interests I am very often met with silent stares or rehearsed answers that they seem to have heard from their parents at a dinner party. We have all seen the ads for tuition centres that promise superior coaching by IIT alumni or the mind-boggling number of apps that are literally in our faces all the time. The coding academy, the robotics classes, the tuitions for the school tuition, the study abroad fairs with ""direct"" admissions, the new swanky IB school, the freaking fingerprint career aptitude test (yep you heard it right) ... spiralling into a multi-billion dollar industry that profits off the parental anxieties. I have been part of it ... and I don't think I want to be at least till I think this more.

But, now I am closer to saying ""rehne do!"" or ""let them be!"" But then we add in the element of international admissions and we can't ""rehne do!"" So I think in India we love us some formulas - with parents that are a direct result of formulaic learning themselves when we look at international education preparation we just work better with equations. This much social service, this much coding, this much school activities, this much SAT etc etc etc. We approach the SAT like we approach the JEE. With the idea to ""Crack it!"" whatever that means. We put our kids in IB curriculum which is individualistic and intensive, at schools which promise the best teachers - yet send our kids lugging round to tuitions. I mean if I need tuitions after paying Rs 10,00,000 + in fees - what am I paying for?! Then there are those resume-building activities - the internships that you source from a friend of a friend, the certificates from causes and NGOs that magically appear and that the kids feign enthusiasm for in their essays. I think the study abroad aspirations hit our shores like the cyclone hitting Rameshwaram. And in the winds, it is the teens who were swept up.

I speak from the Indian perspective but if the ""success"" of varsity blues scandal in the US, or the rise of Asian tiger mom ideology is anything to go by the issue seems like an international educational challenge that we aren't talking about enough. I get it that we want our kids to study in the best colleges if we are paying millions of dollars converted from our Indian incomes - but I feel like there is a better way for us to approach this. I would like to hear your opinions as I continue finding my own way through this chaos. Let's talk people!"

Scheduled,Shipping luggage from Delhi airport to pune at 2 in the night,i will land at Delhi airport (terminal 3) from an international flight at 2 in the night. And will proceed to pune in the morning - different airline. I will be bringing 64 kgs of luggage but the baggage allowance on my domestic leg is 15 kgs only. I tried to buy extra luggage but on the website I could buy only upto 30 kgs extra. How can I ship my luggage to pune from delhi given that I will land at 2 in the night and will take off sometime in the early morning? Blue dart and other couriers schedule pickup only during the day (i also don't know if they pickup from the airport). What are my options?
Scheduled,TIFU by being from a Scheduled Caste but apparently not looking like one,"Sorry for the dramatic title. Also as TIFUs usually go, this did not happen today but over a period of a month

A little background, I'm a 27 year old male, IIM passout. working in a well known consulting firm earning about 30LPA. I am a sincere, hardworking, simple dude. Since most caste related discussions always end up about reservation, lemme clarify that I never used it. Got 99.4 %ile in CAT, also had got AIR in 600's general in IITJEE. But here's the catch, despite being a Telugu SC, apparently I don't look like one. I am light-skinned and have good facial features I guess.

So I figured I was ready to get married. Since I had no luck on Tinder and was extremely busy to go out and find someone, I created a profile on one of those matrimony websites for professionals because I want an educated, broad-minded working wife. MISTAKE #1. Most of the profiles on there were of girls from highly educated backgrounds and thats the reason I thought I could find someone like me whom I could connect with in terms of principles, attitude toward education/work/life, my agnostic beliefs etc.

I checked the 'Any' option on caste as it doesn't matter to me and figured since this is a place for educated professionals, nobody really cares about caste. MISTAKE #2.

So within a week, I get a fair amount of matches. Some are handled by parents, some handled by the girls themselves. Here are some interesting experiences I had over a period of a month:

1) **Telugu Unkil**: Caste mentioned - Kapu. Says he is ""highly interested"" in my profile. I mail him back saying if he has any caste preferences and that I prefer open-minded people in general. Writes back saying how his daughter is very broad-minded, hates traditional mindset and they are looking for a very liberal family. I think great, I would like to know more about her and we started talking on whatsapp and we seem to hit it off pretty well. 5 days later she asks me my caste and I mention it. Ghosted. No replies, she unfriends me on facebook, blocks me on whatsapp. I move on.


2) **Gril**: Works for a big bank in Mumbai. Mentions 'Any' caste. So I think great. I message her and she accepts it. We exchange numbers and start talking. A week goes by, we have talked about our jobs, future plans, location preferences and want to schedule a personal meetup. She messages me - ""hey I think you should know this, I am from Teli caste which is OBC. Hope your parents are ok?"" I tell her I don't care and neither do my parents. Then I tell her about my caste, and she starts acting weird. Starts replying to my texts in syllables and tries to hang up on my calls. I feel bad and message her asking what ticked her off. She says that she thought I was from an upper caste and that's why she replied to my message. And now she doesn't want to proceed any further and want to cancel all further plans. I told her that it's a bit hypocritical of her that initially she was one wanting my parents to be ok with her being OBC when she thought I was from OC. 


3) **Marathi Auntie**: This one's a bit hilarious. She sends me a message saying she really liked my profile for her daughter. I look it up and sure enough - mentioned 'any caste'. I give her my number and she sends me a complete biodata about her daughter. Daughter is really pretty and from MDI Gurgaon, I think great. But she mentions caste as 'Rigvedi Brahmin'. I think oh f**k. I send her all the details, mention my caste and even bracket it with '(SC)'. Immediately she goes, ""I really like your profile. Tell me the next steps or give me your parents number"". I'm like - this can't be happening. Then it hits me that maybe she has glanced over the caste part in her hurry. So I send another text saying,- ""ma'am pls confirm that you have seen my caste, and it falls under Scheduled Caste"". Never heard back from her.


There are a few more like this. Most of the profiles message me about my caste and go silent when I mention it. I realized that all my life, my circle of friends have ranged from all castes, religions and financial backgrounds and they never made me feel like a dalit or whatever. I have lived a happy and fairly successful life. That was the reason I was ignoring the caste aspect for finding someone to spend my life. 

Now I have learnt my lesson and changed my caste to clearly say SC and will stick to my own I guess. I also feel like giving up on these matrimony websites. It's been a great learning experience about my position in the society folks! :)"

I reckon flying back right now is too much of a disruption to my schedule. Especially since the tories have effectively said we’re doing fuck all and not shutting down universities, schools, etc. This means that I’ll end up missing lectures and other important things. 

With the number of cases increasing exponentially, my folks say that I can be home while it simmers down and then return. I’m in a bit of a dilemma here. Is the situation in India any better? I read india is not doing community testing so the actual number of positive cases is much higher."

What kind of human would do it to themselves? Believe me, they don't. They drink a lot before and after to avoid the trauma of working in such conditions. And that takes a toll on their financial condition(which is already low) and their family. So, what's the solution? 

There should be a law which prevents man-power to clean sewage drains and tanks. But that's already there in the law! Then what's the hurdle? There's a lack of safety equipments and technical equipments to clean the drains without a man entering the manholes. They do it because there's no other way to do it. And people expect them to do it because almost all sewage workers belong to the scheduled caste. These casteist feelings are present everywhere which alienates their voice for a reform in the system. 

In my opinion, Indian government must spend money on buying advanced sewage equipments and safety equipments and masks. And they should be present in every municipality office, for free. Government should also conduct training programs to teach the sewage workers on how to use those equipments effectively. And the final step is that of citizens, to stop looking at them as the ""untouchables"" and appreciate them as human beings who clean up your shit, so that you don't have to.

Scheduled,DO and DONT of flight travel ( Due to increase in flight anxiety threads and for future if anyone wants reference),"Mods kindly make a thread for it. Copy paste this content if you like. Flights are a bit of serious business and I can understand why youngsters might feel incredibly anxious 

Some important things to keep in mind first - 

1. Your flight ticket has to be shown to security outside and check in counter. It can be printed as well as shown from mobile ( Avoid taking screenshot of website from where you confirmed your ticket. Take the PDF/JPG which you get via mail from the site. )

2. All domestic flights have a STRICT 45 min closure of check in before their scheduled departure. So make sure that you reach AT LEAST 1.5 hours before your flight. In case you are reaching 1 hour before ( hurt shy of 15 mins for check in closure), kindly INFORM the personnel there that your flight is of that time. Often, they will start to call you themselves by saying FLIGHT TO XYZ area, anyone there. But to be on safe side, do ask personnel there.

3. Airports are supposed to be one of the best and most organized places of any city. So you can expect that there will be proper signboards to guide you.


DO- 1. Keep your power bank inside your handbag and your other stuff like knives,scissors,liquid greater than 100ml inside the check in baggage. 

2. Keep.your power bank, chargers, laptop in your hand baggage. 

3. General weight limit for domestic is 15 kg in check in and 7 in Hand baggage. 

4. In any doubt, ASK the personnel at airport, especially the airline you have booked. Like if you have booked Air India or something, ASK them any doubt. Remember, they are there to help you only.



DONT - 1. DO NOT PANIC during security check. It is simple. You need to keep your belts, chargers, wallets, watch, mobile and laptops etc in one tray and your bag in other tray. Don't worry, the army personnel there just look scary. They are, in fact, VERY helpful. 

2. Ok this is a common mistake women do. Your bags are Pandora boxes. Often you women go in security check and VOILA, you have scissors, knives ( MULTIPLE) and 2-3 bottles coming out of your bag. Remember all those items are broken there as they can't be taken in flight and you can't do anything for sharp objects. And you have to discard liquid if your bottle is filled and js more than 100ml. So kindly CHECK YOUR HAND BAGS BEFORE LEAVING FOR AIRPORT. 

3. DO NOT abuse the airline members for any delays which are not their fault. Remember they are mostly doing everything they can to solve your problem. And if they can't, chances are you were the reason ( Like you coming 40 mins before flight and check in is closed.) Don't be the guy who screams - I KNOW YOUR MANAGER/MAALIK/OWNER/DAD etc. 

4. DO NOT worry that you will crash lol. Many people who are travelling for first time may be scared. I don't blame them as flight crashes are always big news.

However rest assured because the chances that you will get into a car accident is HIGHER compared to you getting in flight accident. Seriously. It is THAT safe.

If I remember more stuff, I will mention it here. Others also please combine and add stuff which I may have forgotten. I am a busy man"
Scheduled,Qnet...Dnt tell I didn't tell you,"Some of us might have heard of Qnet and for those who haven't this thread is for you guys

This actually happened like a year ago and I had totally forgotten about it till someone pitched me Qnet again a few days ago.

Back in 2018, I had quit my cushy job and just about started my own startup - so money was tight, I was highly motivated and looking to jump at any opportunity and this is when a guy I used to work with messaged me and told me he had this insane opportunity for me. He said it was a limited-time opportunity and he was recommending me to his mentors - this is where I started feeling like this is an MLM pitch or some sort of scam but given that I had always known him to be an honest fellow I gave him the benefit of the doubt.

He scheduled a meet with some senior and this was in Sheraton, Delhi. So, first I meet this lady who says she's been working with this eCommerce/ networking company for past 2-3 years and here is the gist of the talk I had with her

1. She earns lakhs by working only a few weeks of the month, travels the world when she fancies, blah blah stuff like that.
2. I heard more irrelevant business jargons in 45 mins from her than I did in my 2 years of b-school.
3. Tried to discuss on a few of the business jargons she had been throwing around and I realised she only knows the terms and not what they mean.
4. So in 45 mins, I hear everything from her own success story to random stuff, but not a single word of what the opportunity is about or what the revenue model is - only that the more hours I put in, the more money I make and the returns are like 500%.
5. She says she liked my personality, motivation and whatnot and would let me know if I qualified for the program. Then she goes on for 10-15 minutes to say how CEOs, VPs, etc. are lining up for this opportunity and even shows me her contact list saying all these people have been after her life so that she lets me in on this once in a lifetime opportunity. By now I had figured out this was some good scam and cursing myself for taking an uber instead of taking the metro. Shes like she will recommend me but chances are 50-50.
6. Guess what? 10 minutes later, a very senior person in the business happens to be coming to this very hotel and that she can arrange for me to meet with him now only and all I had to do was impress him.

Part 2: Meeting the so-called bigshot

1. So I had earlier talked about my love for travelling and building my own business in marketing. So, the guy tells me that he has travelled over 50 countries last year and the lakhs of rupees he makes from this business helped him to secure his own passion project.
2. Apparently he was earning 5 lakhs per month in the IT industry before quitting his job. But despite me repeatedly asking he did not tell me which company he used to work for or even what role he was working in.
3. By now, I am just enjoying my snacks and trying to see how far these scammers will go to sell me whatever it is they are trying to sell.
4. The guy also realised his sales pitch was not working and so he tried to convince me that I was morally responsible for my parents having to work in their old age when I should be able to provide for them and this opportunity was the only way I was going to do that
5. I repeatedly asked him what organization I would be working for and he evaded the question every single time. The only thing he said was that **Microsoft** handles their paperwork and hence, they are a trustworthy company.
6. At the very end, he casually mentions that fees for xyz stuff are **INR 1,70,000** and that I would be making that back in the next few weeks only.

Thanked him, finished my snacks and said I would think about it. I very nearly wanted to go full ballistic and let him know what a load of bs he had been going on about.

Also, they did ask for my PAN CARD photo which I said I didn't have on me and said I will send it once I get back, which I never did.

As for the guy who got me into this entire waste of time, I see him post motivational posts on social media daily, post pics of trips to exotic places and him riding inexpensive cars. He did try to pressure me into paying up the money and all he said was that the company name was QNET and nothing about what they did. A quick google search was enough to verify my doubts.

Hope this story helps someone out there"

2. We'll have our own chat room (in reddit) where we'll report in.
3. Everyday we'll set a ""switch off"" time, which will go on reducing day-by-day until the desired time is reached.
4. Let's say today's switch off time is 11:30 PM. At that time, we'll switch off all screens (phone, PC, TV etc.)

Scheduled,"The true purpose of reservations in India is not economic upliftment, but social inclusion."," ***For the record, I am a Brahmin (I don't see myself as one. It is merely the word that I use when I fill out any Government form that asks me the question) and I have, in no way, benefited from reservations or affirmative action.***

Reservations in India is a fraught topic and tends to divide people like no other topic does. The vast majority of the upper castes blame reservations for India's inefficient Governance and subsequent lack of opportunities. Many others think it is meant to provide economic upliftment to the so-called depressed classes who have been at the receiving end of the caste pyramid for centuries. Others describe it as a necessary evil that does more good than harm. I take objection to this description of reservation as a ""*necessary evil*"" and as a means of economic upliftment. It is not evil and it is necessary. It does not seek to economically uplift the depressed classes. I will now demonstrate why.

Reservations for the depressed classes (scheduled castes or scheduled tribes and so on and so forth) have been a feature of politics, education and employment opportunities in Independent India. The policy aims to reserve a portion of seats in educational institutions, employment opportunities in Government run organisations and in electoral constituencies for those candidates who are identified to be part of the above mentioned communities. These communities have historically been marginalised and have been downtrodden for millennia. In the case of the Scheduled Tribes (or STs), their predilection to residing in the forests and the remote hinterlands of the Indian sub continent has ensured that they remained outside the purview of mainstream society and thus bereft of the opportunities that are provided by being part of the villages and cities and so on. The tribes of India are for the most part, hunter gatherers living in the remote jungle (such as the Bhils, Gonds and Santhals), or nomadic herders in nature, living with their livestock and migrating from one place to another in search of pasture (such as the Gujjars in some states, though their status as an ST is debatable). Many of these tribes lived only on the margins of human settlements in India and were viewed with hostility and suspicion by most people. The British criminalised many of them by instituting an act called the Criminal Tribes act. Entire communities were criminalised and those who were on the margins of society were further outcast. These communities neither had a say nor were given any kind of justice when their resources (such as forest produce, or land that has historically belonged to them) were extracted (or plundered, if you think that way) by the Government of India in the name of the People of India. Their woman and children have been exploited when they venture out of their remote domains. They have forever been on the margins of society, physically and socially, and have had no voice in the debates of modern India, a country that now counts them as its citizens.

The Scheduled Castes (or SCs) have been treated worse. These communities were classified as social outcasts and were often forced to live outside the village. They weren't allowed to draw water from the same well as the rest of the village, they weren't allowed to visit the temple or take part in the communal activities such as festivals or decision making. They provided an important source of agricultural labour in villages (and still do) and performed menial jobs in the cities that were ritually considered impure or dirty. The agricultural economy would collapse if their labour was not available and sanitation would have been non-existent in the cities without the *Dalits* to clean the toilets and clear the corpses. And yet, they were not part of the conversation when it came to society. They have never had a voice, a say in the decisions that are made when the community gets together and makes a collective decision. They have been exploited physically, economically, and socially by all and sundry. Their status has been little better than slaves. They are an important part of Indian society but have little to no say in the affairs of the country or the state, and yet they are counted as citizens of India.

Why am I telling you so much about how these communities have been excluded over thousands of years? Because reservation is not a policy that primarily seeks to economically uplift communities and give them education and jobs. The purpose of reservation is not economic upliftment but ***social inclusion*** within the mainstream of society, in effect giving them a say in governance and a voice in society. Reservation aims to bring these communities into the social mainstream so that they become part of the conversation and are able to participate fully in society (In politics, in our educational institutions, in employment, in decision making capacities and so on). Without affirmative action policies such as reservation, these communities will forever be marginalised on the outskirts of society. They will be denied a voice and denied opportunities to advance, and denied the right to be treated with dignity as Humans. The harm done to these communities by centuries of prejudice has hardly begun to be redressed by the policies of Independent India. 

It is highly unfortunate that the original purpose of reservation has been warped in such a manner that all and sundry (I am looking at the OBCs and those who advocate reservations for economically weaker sections among the upper castes now) are demanding reservations. Reservation is not about economic opportunity. It is about social justice, and economic opportunity is a by product of social opportunity. Until such a time arrives when these communities are afforded the same social opportunities as the rest of society and are not excluded, reservations are a necessity in India. It is ***not*** a necessary evil. It is ***not*** an evil at all. It is justice."

Scheduled,[serious] Can someone please suggest me a way to solve issue with my passport application being rejected,"I don't know if this is the right place to ask these kind of questions, please remove this if it's in the wrong subreddit.


### So this is my situation


I on the last round of interview for an Irish company. And I don't have a passport yet ( I know it's dumb ). So I applied for the passport and went to the passport office today and my application got rejected due to the lack of identification documents.

I went there with 3 docs. Aadhar, pan And my sslc certificate.
I only have Aadhar, and pan card as identification docs. ( I have voters ID but the name in there is spelled wrong ). So the mam at the counter told me if there is any other documents I have, and suggested that I can get a online birth certificate. So I went to the near by Cafe and took a print out of the birth certificate. 

But in that, my name was given with out my initials. So the Assistant Passport officer rejected my application. 


So when I went back to ask what else I can do . The mam at the counter told me that if I applied for non tatkal passport I will need only two identification documents ( plus sslc certificate ). 

So I came back home and went to nearest *E-seva Kendra* to reapply for the passport in  non tatkal way.

## problem 2

Imagine my name is *Michael Jackson Obama*

So in my sslc certificate my name is written as *Michael JO.* And in my Aadhar and pan card it's written as *Michael Jackson Obama* . So he says that I cannot apply passport like this. I have to change my name in the sslc certificate to match my Aadhar. 

*Q1:* But the passport officer didn't mention any of these. Is that. Problem ? 

Changing my name in my sslc could take up to a couple of weeks. But if it takes that long I could lose my job.

I currently don't have licence. 

*Q2:* what are my options for getting a passport ASAP. ?


**Edit :- 10/03/2020**

I went to meet my uncle's friend who has some knowledge on these things. 

So I have been told that there will be no problem for me to apply passport via non tatkal route. 
Since my name on the PAN card and Aadhar is just expanded form of my name in the sslc certificate. So that won't be a problem. Appointment for the passport office has been scheduled at 16th March so I will post what happens next.


**Edit :- 16/04/2020**

I finished the interview in the passport office with out any trouble. They asked me which name I want in my passport. **Michael JO** or **Michael Jackson Obama**. So the whole process was over under 45mins. So waiting for police verification now."

Scheduled,Caste conundrum : Why do upper castes believe discrimination doesn’t exist ?,
Scheduled,Appreciation to Maharashtra Government,"Read the post-script if you feel that I am wrong at any line. (Post Script is at the end)

I am neither related to any political party nor I want to support or say bad about any Political Party. This post is just to appreciate Maharashtra Government and to give reason for people in Maharashtra to support the Government to fight against Coronavirus.

The steps that Maharashtra Government took to fight against Coronavirus may look drastic and unnecessary but I wish to say something about it. Many developed countries like USA, Spain, Italy etc. have taken these measures after the virus spread. In Maharashtra as of today morning, according to news channels, although there were 49 infected people, 40 of them came from other countries and just 9 were the ones who were in contact with the affected. For a  heavily populated country like India, these numbers are almost unbelievable. If the government did not take such drastic measures, these numbers would not have been so small. I agree that these measures disturb our schedule and many think that this is just a step by Medical Industries to increase income but WHO wouldn't have taken the steps during already going on recession.

These numbers are better than many Developed countries. We have to appreciate Maharashtra Government for their hardwork and co-operate with them. If everyone cooperates with the Government then Government will surely loosen the restrictions and we will have less trouble. 

Don't overestimate your immune system and don't assume that you won't get infected. Just follow the instructions given out by the Health Minister. 

P.S.: These are just my own thoughts. You can choose to ignore them if you disagree"
Scheduled,Trip Advise: Uttarakhand/Himachal - June or later - 2 people - 3/4 days,"Hi,

I'm planning a honeymoon trip to either Uttarakhand or Himachal for me and my fiance (Provided Corona settles down). These two are the places that we're interested in right now, but suggestions are welcome for any other hillstation/scenic places too. Budget is around 50k flexible for 3/4 days and 3/4 nights.

Even though Shimla/Manali were common choices, it looks airports are far from these places and I don't wanna sit in bus/car for 9hrs+ straight. I'm looking for places which have airports much closer and Dehradun came up. I was thinking of may be covering Dehradun, Nainital etc. in June.

1. Are Dehradun and Nainital good for a peaceful honeymoon trip? I'm not looking to cover a lot of places with a tight schedule. I'd rather visit a few calm and quiet scenic places and spend a bit of time there.
2. Is the weather nice there in June or will it be too hot? Also in case Corona situation continues how's the weather during July/August? I don't wanna extend it too much to really cold weather either.
3. I'm planning to book hotels on my own and hire a cab with driver for the duration. Any suggestion on this? Looking for reliability more than anything, since this will be our first trip I don't want any hassles as you can imagine. Or any reliable packages that I should look into?
4. Any other scenic places near to these locations that I must visit? Like I mentioned before I don't wanna spend a lot of time in car especially if the terrain is rough.

Thanks you for reading and sorry for the long post."

Scheduled,Crimes in Delhi,"Hi guys,

I am sorry if this post doesn't belong here or If it sounds like a rant but just 2 days back, I just came to know that my cousin's dad was attacked brutally by 2-3 goons in Dwarka at night when he was returning from work on his bicycle. He got off the metro at around 12am at night and was on his way home when he was stopped and beaten mercilessly. The goons didn't rob him and stopped only when they saw a PCR van approaching.

He is in the hospital now and had multiple scans done and is now scheduled for jaw surgery. This is truly heartbreaking for me as their family is really nice. They are a family of three, all of them highly educated, hardworking  and soft spoken people. He returns late from work everyday and rides his bike from the metro station to home even though he has a car just to stay fit while also reduce carbon emissions from his side.

The police doesn't seem to be helping much and are treating it as ""just another everyday case"", like this is normal and expected at Delhi streets. And ofcourse I expect nothing ever to happen to the people who did this, and I am pretty sure they wont get caught.

Just wanted to put this out there, stay safe people and care for your loved ones, you never know what could can happen on the streets of New Delhi."

With all the commotion going on and Jet cancelling international flights, **is there any way I can get all my money on those tickets back** (without the losing 10,500 per ticket)?

As per the ticket fine print, I am eligible for a full refund if they reschedule or cancel. But they haven't mailed me personally about the reschedule, I have sent them a mail asking for my money.

Scheduled,Taj Mahal (Best Moment Of Life),[removed]
Scheduled,I have been getting calls from some organization called Child Help Foundation and want to know if they are legit.,"So some lady called Seema contacted me yesterday asking me to donate some money for some child's operation. I was outside at the time and asked her to contact me later. So she called me again today. When I asked her where she got my number from, she is not replying. On repeatedly asking, she said some database (but was very vague about it). I started asking her multiple questions about the disease and treatment and all she said she will send me pictures and documents about it, but was once again, very vague. On asking her more questions about the hospital, she kept saying they are legit and the child needs help. When I bluffed and said that since I am a journalist, let me do some background check and get back to you, she sounded a little concerned and said okay and asked me to call back when I can.

Now I have been doing some research and found a website and all for this, but there is absolutely no buzz on the thing they want to the fact that it seems made up. I found something about the child she mentioned and apparently the surgery was scheduled for yesterday, so dunno why she is calling me today also. I found a similar letter of appeal from the doctor she mentioned by name, but for another child. I don't know, a lot of things about this whole thing seem fishy.

**TL;DR - I wanted to know if anyone has gotten a call from some Seema (or anyone else) from Child Help Foundation asking for a donation for a child called Sia Samanta who's operation costs 16.5 Lakhs. If it is fake, I am legit going to a journalist friend and tweeting to the cops about this shit along with her number and all so they don't exploit other people.**"
Scheduled,Disappointing startup environment here in India,"As the title suggests, although there are some really good (supposedly) government initiatives on incubating infant startups but I haven't once come across a discussion thread related to startups in this subreddit. So I was wondering if you've a startup or did and it failed for some reason or the other, how was the experience? What lessons did you learn from it? Do you've plans for another one? What were some bureaucratic hurdles you have faced and how are you supposed to tackle them?

A fact that caught me by surprise was that the IT sector contributes 7.7% to the GNP which definitely correlates to the fact that the tech environment in the country isn't as impotent as suggested by various reports. Agreed that a significant portion of the software engineers are in need of a major reskilling but look at the bigger picture. India is a country of 1.3Bn people and out of it, for a small section of the populace who are into IT, to contribute close to 8% of the \~3Tn economy is damn huge! 

Considering this, it's hard to believe that, not even one of those millions strong IT workforce failed to come up with a noble and most importantly a sustainable business of his/her own. Anyway, that's just my opinion from looking at certain statistics and although numbers rarely lie but sometimes fail to portray a bigger picture of an underlying issue.

I'm looking to having an open discussion here and if it works out maybe I could try out a scheduled discussion thread on startups, to discuss everything from ideas to official procedures, etc. So tell me more about your startup(s) and help me understand the startup scenario better in this country."

Long story short: He was in Congress, he dissented. He came out of it, along with other rebels + MLAs of BJP he became Chief Minister Of Arunachal Pradesh.

&#x200B;

>The [Supreme Court of India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India) dismissed Pul's government in July 2016. The court ruled out Governor [Jyoti Prasad Rajkhowa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jyoti_Prasad_Rajkhowa)'s decision on the formation of Pul's government. The Congress party accused Rajkhowa of tacitly helping the rebels by calling the assembly session in December, a month ahead of schedule. The government was also formed without a floor test or asking the Chief Minister to prove his majority in the house.[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalikho_Pul#cite_note-NDTV13Jul-16) [Nabam Tuki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabam_Tuki) took over after Pul but he was not accepted by a majority of the Congress MLAs. Pul and the dissident MLAs came back to the Congress fold and supported [Pema Khandu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pema_Khandu) as the Chief Minister.[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalikho_Pul#cite_note-NDTV9Aug-18)[\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalikho_Pul#cite_note-Violent-19)[\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalikho_Pul#cite_note-20)

&#x200B;

Look's like Usual Politics right?

&#x200B;

The judgement above was given by 5 judges [constitutional bench headed by JS Khehar](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/national/apex-court-restores-cong-govt-in-arunachal/article8843249.ece) \[He wasn't CJI back then\].

&#x200B;

**The trouble to JS Khehar begins now.**

&#x200B;

>Pul died on 9 August 2016 at the age of 47. His body was discovered that morning hanging from the ceiling fan in the room where he practiced [yoga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga).[\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalikho_Pul#cite_note-Violent-19) Police took the body into custody and sent it for autopsy.[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalikho_Pul#cite_note-Protest-21) He allegedly committed [suicide by hanging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_by_hanging) in the Chief Minister's bungalow at [Itanagar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itanagar) which he still occupied while his home was under renovation. He is survived by three wives and four children.[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalikho_Pul#cite_note-Protest-21)

>In 2017, the [Committee on Judicial Accountability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_on_Judicial_Accountability) published the suicide note written by former [Arunachal Pradesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arunachal_Pradesh) Chief Minister, [Kalikho Pul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalikho_Pul). In the note, Pul claimed that Khehar had demanded ₹49 crore (Para 15.22, Page 39) and ₹31 crore (Para 15.27, Page 41) in bribes from Pul for delivering a favourable verdict.[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagdish_Singh_Khehar#cite_note-15) The [Committee on Judicial Accountability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_on_Judicial_Accountability) has demanded a probe in the matter.[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagdish_Singh_Khehar#cite_note-16)

>The letter alleges that Pul was approached by the son of [Justice Khehar Singh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagdish_Singh_Khehar) for a bribe of 49 crores to get the decision in his favour.  
>  
>The note also accused a relative of Dipak Misra, Khehar’s colleague on the bench, of having done the same thing.

The events which followed :

>Taking into account the serious allegations against various constitutional functionaries, Justice Khehar directed that the whole matter requires a serious judicial deliberation. Pursuant to this order, the matter was listed before a division bench.

A Bribery Case

>Transcripts of purported conversations between the three accused persons – retired Odisha high Court Judge I.M. Qudussi, middleman Vishwanath Agarwala and B.P. Yadav of the Prasad Education Trust – in the medical college bribery scam reveals that college officials had, in fact, planned to bribe senior functionaries of the Supreme Court and the Allahabad High Court in return for a favourable judgement, reports The Wire. [1](https://thelogicalindian.com/news/transcripts-cbi-tapes-accused-medical-college-bribery-scam-prashant-bhushan-cji-dipak-misra)

**CJI Mishra was one of the judge who gave the judgement \[mentioned above\].**

&#x200B;

There was lot of tussle among top judges.

[**2 bench judge said: It should be taken up by top 5 judges;  which was overturned by the** ](https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2017/nov/10/tussle-in-judiciary-sc-reverses-order-says-cji-is-master-of-the-roster-prashant-bhushan-walks-out-1697879.html)[**bench headed by CJI**](https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2017/nov/10/tussle-in-judiciary-sc-reverses-order-says-cji-is-master-of-the-roster-prashant-bhushan-walks-out-1697879.html)**.**

>Justice Chelameswar, who is the senior-most judge after the CJI, had ordered setting up of the five-judge bench of top judges of the apex court as a petition by an NGO and an advocate had claimed there were allegations against Justice Misra.  
>  
>However, in a dramatic development, the CJI today set up a five-judge bench headed by him and overturned yesterday's order of the two-judge bench, saying the Chief Justice had the sole prerogative of setting up a bench and allocating matters.

&#x200B;

Then,

[**He constituted a three-judge Bench to hear the graft case involving allegations of bribery against members of the higher judiciary.**](https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2017/nov/11/judges-bribery-case-amid-tussle-cji-dipak-misra-says-all-cases-to-be-listed-before-him-1698693.html)

>The three-judge Bench, which would now hear the case on Monday, also comprises Justices R K Agrawal, Arun Mishra and A M Khanwilkar, who were also part of the five-judge Constitution Bench that declared on Friday that it was the CJI’s prerogative to decide which case would be assigned to which Bench.

&#x200B;

**Dipak Mishra, in his entire tenure, gave cases without following SC tradition; which later led to a major event in the history of India.**

On 12 January 2018, four senior judges of the Supreme Court; [Jasti Chelameswar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasti_Chelameswar), [Ranjan Gogoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranjan_Gogoi), [Madan Lokur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madan_Lokur) and [Kurian Joseph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurian_Joseph) addressed a press conference criticising Misra's style of administration and allocation of cases. However, people close to Misra refuted these allegations.[\[27\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipak_Misra#cite_note-27)[\[28\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipak_Misra#cite_note-28)[\[29\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipak_Misra#cite_note-29)  \[I think everyone know about this quite well, So I won't elaborate\]

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Then there's Ranjan Gogoi: I wrote elaborately about him:  [Justice Ranjan Gogoi: The Worst Chief Justice of India (I've ever seen)](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/exexa4/justice_ranjan_gogoi_the_worst_chief_justice_of/)

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

I'm not directly blaming BJP over this \[contrary to the title\].

But let's take a look:

1. Jagdish Singh Khehar's case related to the death of  K Pul.
2. Dipak Mishra: K Pul case &  Bribery case.
3. Ranjan Gogoi : Sexual harassment case.

In all 3 cases, BJP Govt came heavily in support of these judges.

Did it make these judges to incline towards BJP?

Had there been proper protocols to deal with such incidents, which upholds the integrity of SC, wouldn't it be better?

Scheduled,(CONFESSION) Kinda Stuck Here,"Alright people, my post might be a bit self-centered with all the chaos and bloodshed that is happening right now in our capital city. But, I really want to share this out here so as to get some good advice, feedback and discussions.

A few months back, I got a job in very nascent startup and been working there as a Graphic Designer. Tbh, I like everything about the role and the job that I get to do here, people appreciate, validate and respect the work that I am doing here - I have no complaints in that regard.

Sure, being a very new startup, there aren't much co-workers around and the very handful there are, are older to me by a generation or so and thus, we have almost little to none in common with each other. I am also the only designer in my department and thus, things tend to get very lonely for me, at times (though, I've been plagued with loneliness for years now). 

But these aren't a dealbreaker for me and aren't the reasons for why I have made this post in the first place.

The dealbreaker for me however, lies in the fact that I am expected to show up to work for all 7 days. 7\*365. Let alone this, I used to be the kind of person who loathed the idea of there being a 6-day working schedule (as one barely gets to do anything in that single day they get on a Sunday).

I mean, this was made clear to me during interview, when I enquired them about the weekends. And I understand, being a part of the food and beverage industry, the company is expected to operate 24\*7\*365, due to the kind of industry that it is part of.

I thought, after not being in a job for the previous year, my self-discipline and schedule went out of control and thought maybe working all 7 days will get back my old discipline as I thought that it will make me ""more active"" and ""less lazy"". 

And, I guess, I've been proved wrong all the while, simultaneously, my doubts have been proved true too, in regards to working all 7 days.

I struggle to get up early now, even despite getting sound sleep and going to bed early (I made a thread about this, a few days back here). I really feel burned out and am struggling to get my tasks done, due to not being able to focus and concentrate properly. I mean, I felt the burn-out in a mere months after I started working.

Again, I understand the kind of industry I am in, what I don't understand however, is why must I, a designer (well, I am a Marketing Analyst to be more precise, if that helps), needs to show up for all 7 days? I understand the production team needing to show up like that as well, F&B industry but even me too? Besides, the production team, most of them, reside nearby in a lodging whereas, it takes me 40-50 minutes to reach my office and home.

I took a day-off today and whatsapped my boss even, telling him that I need this break as I have been struggling to do my tasks for the past few days for which, he understood and granted.

And thus, I am feeling that this job is too much for me, the schedule at least. Which is sad, as I like almost every aspect of this job, being the only designer in my company, I also don't have any managers supervising or micromanaging ( I report to the CEO directly) and thus, I am bestowed with full control in what I get to do.

The timing is also not fixed. Boss seems like the kind of person who knows what he is actually doing and isn't egoistic, petty or tyrannical in any way.

I honestly don't think that I can get such freedom and privilege anywhere else . And that is why it pains me to share this post as despite all this perks, no matter how good and ""ideal"" a work is for someone, ultimately, there needs to be a break where I could have all the personal time that I crave for and where once, just for once, I don't need to wake up everyday with the thought that I need to go to work for that day. 

Sure, during Sunday I could leave for work earlier than usual but, it defeats the point of keeping it in the first place, doesn't it? To only show up for a handful of hours, there is ample time to get whatever work there is left, in the remaining 6 full days.

My fear is also that, if i resign from this job, I don't think that I would get one anywhere else. Seeking for one for three full months prior to landing in this and eclipsing this from my parents (mother especially, as I feel that they tend to give a typical, Boomer-esque advice that doesn't help me at all and only infuriates me further) was already a cruel and painful experience, man. 

I would quit this in a heartbeat if my mother is an understanding and supportive type. Expect, she is very emotionally abusive and neglectful and will never (and has never in the past too) ever, provide me the support that I want (and even deserve maybe). She will at best, be neutral and at worst, be antagonistic towards me (and she's like that too to both my Dad and sibling).

Based on the feedback I get (and deep down personally), I know that I am not a bad designer, if I try and put effort. And yet, I was sucking in all the interviews that I attended prior. Was it because I am a fresher? I don't want to go to the whole ordeal again.

And thus, I feel like I am stuck here. I am sorry for the long post, but wanted to let this out in the hopes that others can hear and understand the predicament I am in, right now.

TL:DR - Graphic Designer (Marketing Analyst, actually) working for almost 3 months now. Satisfied with everything else, though need to show all 7 days in a week due to the industry and thus, is gradually taking a toll on me. Afraid of quitting and finding a new one in the fears that I won't get any, because of being a Fresher no matter how competent I might be. And also in the fears that I won't get the perks and privileges (that I've described in this post) that I am enjoying here."

Scheduled,"AMA Announcement: Aatish Taseer, writer, journalist. December 27th, 9:30 PM IST (i.e. today!)","Hello r/India,

Most of you are probably already familiar with Aatish and his writing. We invited him for an AMA and he agreed to do it. Aatish will be with us to answer questions and share his opinions on politics, the ongoing citizenship protests in India among other things. 

In case you are not familiar with his work please find some details below:

> Taseer was born in London to politician and businessman Salman Taseer (who was born in British India to a British mother and Indian father, the latter became Pakistani at partition) and Indian journalist Tavleen Singh. His parents never married, he was raised by his mother and had no contact with his father until he was aged 21. He was raised in New Delhi, before attending Kodaikanal International School, a residential school in Kodaikanal.  Taseer later studied at Amherst College  in Massachusetts, earning dual Bachelor of Arts degrees in French and Political Science in 2001.  In his first book Stranger to History (2009), which received many reviews in India, he wrote about his estrangement from his father who was a governor of the Punjab province in Pakistan

> Aatish Taseer became a contributing opinion writer for The International New York Times in the fall of 2015.
> He is the author, most recently, of “The Way Things Were,” which The Los Angeles Review of Books described as “the best Indian novel of the last decade.”
> His other books are “Stranger to History: A Son’s Journey Through Islamic Lands,” a Costa-shortlisted first novel, “The Temple-Goers,” and the highly acclaimed “Noon.” He has written for The Wall Street Journal, The Financial Times and The Sunday Times, London, among other publications.

> On 8 November 2019, Taseer's Overseas Citizenship of India was revoked by the Indian Ministry of Home Affairs claiming he attempted to ""conceal information that his father was of Pakistani origin"". Taseer has said this is untrue, he never concealed the identity of his father with whom he had no contact and his mother was always he only legal guardian as a minor. Taseer alleged that the ministry didn't give him enough time and that it was an act of reprisal. In his May 2019 cover article for Time magazine, published during the Indian election entitled ""India’s divider in chief"" he was highly critical of the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi. He told The Guardian that his citizenship issue had not caused him any problems before the Time article was published. The Home ministry rejected the claim that the Time article had any connection to the rejection of Taseer's citizenship.

> Taseer's first book Stranger to History: A Son's Journey Through Islamic Lands (2009), His part memoir-part travelogue, has been translated into more than 14 languages and hailed as a ""must-read"" for anyone attempting to understand the Muslim world. Taseer's well received translation of Saadat Hasan Manto's short stories from the original Urdu, Manto: Selected Stories, was published in 2008.

The AMA is scheduled for 27th December, 9:30 PM IST. 

Please be there!

Scheduled,"An update to my story of rescuing puppies and some tips, essential information if you want to rescue some puppies too or just want to know what it takes to raise a dog without a mamma dog.","Around 8 months back I posted this thread seeking help on rescuing puppies [that we found in the neighbourhood.](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/augpwm/need_a_little_help_with_these_rescued_puppies/) 

I know it's been a long time I haven't updated what happened thereafter because I got really busy with them. It wasn't easy raising them, they are just like human babies. 

**The journey until the weaning process:**

Soon after making the post in the afternoon I went to a pet store and got Royal Canin (RC) Babydog milk. The making of the milk was very easy, you just have to add warm water and mix according to the label. it comes with feeding bottle and different nipples for cats as well as for dogs. You can use little more or less powder according to your preference, depending how well the puppies are able to tolerate. It had a very bad smell, so bad that I had to wear some masks whenever I used to feed them lol. After few days I got adjusted to the smell. 

also we found out that the babies are only 1 weeks old, their mom died on the night before we took them home.

Don't forget he milk: There's two options that are generally available in pet stores. One is RC Babydog milk and another one is from Beapher Lactol which doesn't come in large packs, overall RC is cheaper (still costly)

Bedding: For bedding we used a hot bag in the lower portion of a carton (big amazon boxes), then some clothing, bed sheet on top of it and newspapers on top of all of them. Basically created a layer so they don't feel the hot bag but continue to get a warm environment. The temperature is extremely crucial to newborn babies as they aren't able to generate or regulate temperature on their own, they rely on their mother for it. The temperature shouldn't be too much or too low, place your hand on the top of bedding if the heat is tolerable only then place them on top of that else just add some little less hot water next time or put some more clothing in the box. Too much warmth can lead to hotspots, blisters on their skin. 

You have to keep in mind their feeding timeline too. For newborns according to breed size (pariah dogs are medium breeds) you have to feed them 8 times in 24 hours. Again you can break them in even more smaller batches. I used to feed them every 1 or 2 hours apart. Gradually increase the gap when they grow up. Don't feed them too much as that may lead to diarrhea. [Here's a chart printed on Royal Canin's Babydog milk.]

When it comes to toilet they don't urinate on their own. You have to take a cotton boll, dip in lukewarm water and stimulate their genitalia to make them urinate. For potty there's no option so keep them over newspaper and replace them when you see them doing potty. The potty is watery because well all  they are just drinking is milk. If you see them covered up in potty just take some cotton balls and clean them with lukewarm water. 

Take care of mosquitoes too, I used to keep some mosquito coils, or good knight burning all the time. 

All was going well until I ran out of RC Babydog milk, I couldn't find it in local pet stores. So I ordered online from Amazon. Was getting good deal on 2kg pack. Sadly it could arrive two days later. 

I contacted some vet and they said to give them amul spray. I didn't like this plan as cow milk has good amount of lactose which is bad for dogs. Seeing no option I had to give them the amul spray by mixing in water. 

It went fine for two days, no digestion issues popped up. Meanwhile the RC milk arrived, this is where comes the saddest part of raising them. 

None of them were able to tolerate the RC milk for some reason, they instantly vomited. Being a noob we continued to give them the RC milk. Three went back to normal ish but one didn't recover. We contacted another vet who told me it's probably because of sudden diet change. They have extremely sensitive stomach and any sudden change would screw them up. The amul spray we used to give had more lactose content which probably made their stomach bad with the lactose content that is why maybe they weren't able to tolerate the RC milk later. Vet told us to give less amount of powder in more water.

Few days later the dog which was affected worse died. :( 

This incident took a toll on other dogs too, they used to vomit a lot after eating. We couldn't find why but came to conclusion it's probably because they used to drink milk in a hurry. So we made some changes in feeding timeline and went with small batches inbetween so that they don't become very hungry. 

**The weaning process:**

1 month later I started the weaning process with Royal Canin Starter as suggested by vet. I tried first by giving them as it is but nope, they would smell  but wouldn't eat. Then I actually read instructions. :p

According to instructions I soaked them in lukewarm water, wait until the pellets become soft then mash them and make a porridge. It also had a very bad smell but tolerable. The smell is extremely important because that's what makes it attractive to them. They would just gobble up their food. I used to give it 5 times a day. Morning at 7am - 10am - 12pm - 6pm - 9pm. 

Yes you can give them rice, daal at this point but some won't like it. It's easier to feed them ""mashed pellets turned into a porridge"". If RC is costly for you Pedigree has same starter food. 

**The worst part of weaning process, the nightmares:** 

After few weeks later they weren't eating the porridge. Again being a noob I didn't understand that it's time to give them solid food because their teeth has grown. Also maybe they just got bored. 

I bought Pedigree starter and made same porridge. This time they ate like they used to before but again some days later they lost interest. That's when I found out it's time for them to eat solid foods. Also found out I'm supposed to give them Royal Canin Medium/Maxi Starter and not Mini. Yes these brands have created different products based on size of breeds. Confusing af. 

So anyway I got the Maxi starter, they used to eat but again stopped eating. This caused me nightmares and I had sleepless nights thinking why they aren't eating. 

Now Royal Canin was getting really costly as they grew up so I tried Pedigree Pro Starter. They liked it a lot but after some day same result, they won't eat. I tried many brands like Purina, Hill's and same result on everything. Luckily they found cheap Pedigree milk and chicken tasty and business as usual. But another problem started up, some used to vomit after eating. Again we found the culprit was eating too fast and drinking a lot of water after eating which is normal in pellet diet. 

After 1 month In between of those pellets and vomiting we tried rice, daal which they didn't like at first, but they absolutely loved rice+curd (amul masti dahi), then as they grew up we started giving them veggies, eggs which also they loved. 

The schedule was: veggies like potato, carrot, pumpkin in the morning. Curd rice at lunch and daal, roti at night. Eggs once a day. Our family has turned completely vegetarian so no nonveg like meat. I know it's foolish, I do give them Pedigree once in a while and eggs. The diet is still the same till date. Dogs are actually omnivorous unlike cats.

**Poops, urine everywhere..**

You'll see them finding their own spot for urinating and pooping, it's extremely crucial to train them else you'll have to deal with poops on floor and urines. Watch some videos on how to potty train, or better hire a trainer. We didn't do any of that in time and as a consequence mine poops everywhere. Still untill they get trained you have to deal with the poops. Better get cheap toilet paper rolls from Amazon, Bigbasket. Buy their own brand like Presto, Solimo and bbhome. To clean the urines get a scotch brite jumper spin mop and some microfiber clothes as they soak more water. Also keep lizol, dettol handy to clean the floor after each poop.

**The de-worming process.**

You have to deworm them periodically before the first vaccination, else vaccination will get wasted. Like humans they also have tapeworms, a lot. Vet suggested us Drontal puppy. You first need to weight the puppy and give 1ml/kg body weight. 

Now how do you weight the puppy? Weight yourself first in a scale then substract it from the weight of you holding the puppy on the scale. Drontal puppy suspension liquid comes with a dropper to measure and feed the puppy. 

Be prepared to see a lot of tapeworms coming out in dog's poop. ALWAYS directly apply dettol, lizol on floor and mop during this time. 

Deworm 14days in between during vaccinations.

**The vaccinations.**

After two months from the post (from their birth date) it was vaccination time. Our vet came to our home and did all the vaccinations. 

* 2 months after birth: DHPPi - For Canine Distemper, Hepatitis, Parvo virus and Para-influenza virus.

* 3 months after birth - 1 month after initial DHPPi - DHPPi booster. 

* 4 months after birth - 1 month after DHPPi booster - Rabies shot.

* 5 months after birth - 1 month after rabies shot: Corona shot. 

From second year onwards you have to give DHPPi booster, Rabies booster, and you can give cororna but I feel it's not necessary as this virus is not widespread in India. So two shots in total. 

Regarding charges doc charged us 2k for DHPPi, 2k for DHPPi booster, 1.7k for rabies and 1.8k for Corona. This is total cost of three dogs and doc's charge for coming to home. 


**The first bath:**

Ideally you shouldn't give them bath until few weeks past the first vaccine shot. But you can use Himalaya Freshcoat. You need to spray them over their coat and dry them off with a towel. After the first vaccine I'd suggest to wait for two weeks and give them bath in lukewarm water with Himalaya Erina Coat Cleanser shampoo.

**Holy mites (and fleas).**

If you are adopting a street dog then it's most likely to come with some parasites. Often it comes from mom and environment. You won't notice them until they are 1 or 1.5 and even later days months old. You'll probably notice some bumps, redness, poor coating, blood. Sadly our dogs came with parasites and got [affected in the worst way.](https://imgur.com/a/ApNnu1n) As we couldn't bath them until vaccination we had to use erina fresh coat spray and Erina powder. Those didn't help at all, there was flesh wounds. We used to give Wokazole lotion, Himalaya Scavon spray and they did help to recover from the wounds. They were also itching very badly so doc gave some injections (after first vaccination) which costed us ₹600. 

Those insects also affected me and my mom. Mites spread fast and also on humans. Luckily they don't last long on human. I got redness and bumps all over my elbow and shoulders during that time. My mom got itching for a month! She had to take some anti histamine. 

It's an endless battle. This issue is still present on them, I shower them with two shampoos: bolfo and erina coat cleanser every week with spot on application evey two months. Their coat is way better now. 

**The fights and battles:**

I got two males and one female dog. Earlier they used to eat together but as they grew up they started to fight with each other during eating. One would eat other's food but won't let anyone touch their plate lol. So had to give them food in three rooms which I still do. 

**My deteriorating health during this time:** 

I was really frustrated with the redness and bumps all over my body, also got deeply scratched by them. The scratch happened before they got their rabies vaccine so I was really scared of getting rabies as I didn't have any prior rabies vaccination. I went to a doc and he suggested 5 dose of rabies vaccine on  day 0, 3rd, 7tg, 14th and 28th day.

 Then one day when they were fighting I tried to separate them and by mistake my thumb got punctured into one's lower tooth. It was very deep so I got even more scared, there was endless blood, pain. I washed my thumb into running tap water and also used detergent. Went to same doc in evening, he said not to worry as I was already getting vaccinations so RiG is not needed (Rabies immunoglobulin). He gave me instructions to complete 3 tetanus shots and gave some antibiotic ointment. 

During my last rabies shot I got pneumonia/bronchitis, wasn't able to get up from bed, Had extreme fever of 104-105 and fever stayed there for three days straight, also was experiencing terrible chest pain while getting up or trying to sleep. Mom went to medicine shop and they gave some paracetamol and antibiotic which helped a little but the fever woukd again shot up to 104-105. 

Four days later I went to doc and he gave me same paracetamol, antibiotic but also added penicillin.Which helped tremendously and my fever was gone in next few days. 

But after the fever went away the chest pain didn't. It haunted me for months. Doc prescribed some paracetamol to help and some syrup. In the end it went away. 

Meanwhile while visiting the medicine shop for my last vaccine of rabies they said it won't help if I get the rabies shot that time because it was late. In confusion wheather to start rabies shots again from day 0, I took the last shot and went to doc. He said no worries. 

**Finally here's how they looks now:**

[This one is a male, we call him babla/tiya(Bengali name, tiya means parrot).](https://i.imgur.com/WcIt2Xv.jpg) He's nicest of the bunch, always stays away from fight.

* Here's how he looked when he was around [2 months old.](https://imgur.com/a/iPPUzYgk)

[This one is also a male, we call him Ananda (Happiness).](https://i.imgur.com/xRT2gM9.jpg) He's quite the troublemaker, always fighting, biting and peeing everywhere.

* Here's how she looked when she was around [2 months old.](https://imgur.com/a/1W3Z8XT)

**Some do and don'ts for someone willing to rescue a puppy, or looking to own a dog:**

**Do:**

* Always consult a vet.

* For strays check with locals for approx date of birth, it helps. 

* Stock cheap toilet papers, cotton balls, lizol, dettol, newspapers. You are gonna need it. 

* Always clean floor with dettol after they do their business if they aren't trained. 

* Buy Erina Freshcoat, Erina EP powder. Use them until first bath, this will help with parasites. Also any clotrimazole dusting powder during rainy seasons. Wokazole Plus lotion, scavon spray.

* Deworm properly and carefully. 

* If you are giving them amul milk, amul spray make sure to use little milk, powder and mix with water. 

* Pedigree Pro is a good alternative to Royal Canin. 

* Fresh veggies and foods should be prioritised over pellets. (If you have time)

* Give them treats when they are nice and obeyes your orders. Like hug them a lot. 

* Trim their nails frequently.

**Don't:**

* Do not suddenly change their diet when they are young, this could turn into fata casuality. Always keep in mind the transition period where you have to mix some of old food with new food and gradually increase new food over the period. 

* For newborns ALWAYS check for bedding temperature. Make sure it's tolerable, not too high or low. 

* Milk is always a no no. Curd is good because it has probiotics which helps with digestion. My dog loves amul masti dahi. 

* Don't leave too much gap between meals for young dogs, if their  stomach gets too much empty they'll might vomit during morning or anytime. 

**Was it worth it?**

I would say yes, during this time I got really attached to them. I knew what it takes to raise a child. 

Yes they are always fighting, ruined our walls, our new sofa, our washing machine cover. Our fridge. They wake me up at 5 demanding breakfast, there was a time when I had to wake up at 5 to make breakfast for them. One urinates like fountain. One urinates everywhere. I always get scratched by them. We spent about  ₹10-15k in vaccines, milk, endless bottles of shampoos, scavon spray, Wokazole lotion, spot-ons. 

But all those nuisance doesn't feel bad at all whenever my sister comes home from work and they licks her face with love. You got to see them in person lol, they would make different sounds, gets all excited after hearing door bell then jumps onto her. Same with me and my mom whenever we enter home. 

This turned out to be quite a long post, so sorry for that. Also sorry to everyone who has pmed me and I didn't reply, I was really busy with all these.

Scheduled,"Hi r/india, I made a bot to stop fake news on WhatsApp","[edit 3: looks like it's been blocked by Facebook. Fuck. I will try to speak to them about this]

As we all know, WhatsApp is a major source of disinformation in our country. To help mitigate this, I've created a bot that crowdsources information on fake WhatsApp forwards. It works with text, photos, videos, audio clips, etc.

Wanna try it out? **Send any fake forwards that you have received to +14704378045** (over WhatsApp). Please encourage any gullible friends you might have to try it too.

It's a little bit volatile at the moment (blame Facebook for making automation difficult) and goes down from time to time. Please be patient if this happens, it is scheduled to restart at 5:30 am IST everyday.

Comments and suggestions welcome.

Edit 2:
Many people are asking how the bot stops fake news, so I'm copy pasting my explanation here -

There are two main scenarios:

1. You receive a WhatsApp forward which you know is factually fake and want to report it. You can forward the message to this bot and report it as fake, and leave a note as to why you think it's fake.

2. You receive a WhatsApp forward and want to check if it's genuine before believing it/passing it on. You can forward it to the bot, and the bot will inform you how many people have reported it as fake and their reasons for doing so

Scheduled,My recent experience with a NEXA dealership.,"TLDR: Don’t take the word of a car dealership/service station at its face value. Do your due diligence, ask around  before committing to any off the schedule repair/maintenance. 

So about 3 weeks back, I borrowed a near new condition Ignis (about 2.5 year old and less than 15k kms) from a cousin and drove to about 130kms to a town nearby for some urgent family matter. 

15 mins into the drive, the steering felt a bit strange and I stopped over to check. Upon inspection of the tires and the engine bay, everything seemed ok. But thought I’d get the wheels balanced and aligned once I reach my destination. So I refilled the tires with correct air pressure (which was off a bit) and went on my way.

Drive to the destination was fine and mostly highway driving. Upon reaching my destination I noticed that the car’s front tire assembly would make a funny sound on sharp turnings, as I was parking it. Opened up the hood and saw a lot of grease/oil smeared near the passenger cv shaft ( the rod that connects the engine to the tire and drives it). I immediately knew that the CV boot ( rubber cover around a bearing) had busted and had spilled all its grease. 

But just to be sure and since this was not my car, I took it straight to the Nexa showroom, while I also calling the owner of the car. The Nexa showroom people pointed me to the their service station, which thankfully wasn’t that far. Nobody at the showroom bothered to come see the car and see if it was even drivable (or safe to drive). But I can understand since this was just a sales showroom.

Upon reaching the service centre the foreman inspects the car and says that the whole cv shaft is broken and would need a replacement. I asked if he was 100% sure and asked to see the owner for confirmation. The owner repeats the same and they quote me Rs 7000 (plus labour) for the fix and ask me to leave the car there for a few days as they would need to order the part. I asked them to provide me with a inspection/quotation paper. Which they did. I then tell them that according to my experience and knowledge only the cv boot needs replacement. They totally dismissed my input. By this time I had already removed the car from their service station and parked it outside. 

I then call my cousin and explain the whole situation in front of the service station owner and the foreman. I tell him what the Nexa service people think was the problem and the price and time associated with the fix. He then asks me what my opinion was, and I tell him that that the CV shaft in my opinion was ok and only the boot/rubber cover needs replacement and refilling with grease. Since the wheel still had power and the CV shaft was intact in one piece, and the reason for the sound was no/low grease around the cv bearing. I tell him that I knew that the CV shaft was fine and only the boot/rubber covering was broken since about 4 years ago I had personally replaced the whole CV shaft on my own car (common issue on older cars) and know about these issues.

After hearing this, the owner leaves and the foreman asks me to sign the quotation/service form which now states that they couldn’t repair the car because of “unavailability of part”. 

After that, I go to a car repair market nearby and consult with the mechanic there. Who confirms my diagnosis. And after confirming with my cousins, he fixes it within 1.5 hours for a total of Rs 700. The car drives fine, no problems since. 

Knowing that this was not my car, I would have happily paid more that Rs 700 if Nexa service people were willing to replace the cv boot. Maybe just maybe they don’t replace the cv boot, period. But at least they could have been honest with me and not miss diagnosed the issue. I never trusted car dealerships and their service stations, this just added to the list."

Scheduled,Either India's property developers are insane or I am.,"I'm at the age where buying a house is the next thing on my agenda. I've been looking at listings on property websites a lot lately. So consequently, most of the ads I see online on Instagram, Facebook and even Reddit are for properties.

Nothing about these properties or their pricing makes any sense to me whatsoever.

Take a new development by Godrej in Delhi - Godrej South Estates. They've been spamming the shit out of me with their ads. The prices start at ""only"" 2.6cr for. 2 bedroom. For a 4 bedroom apartment, rates start at 6.5-7cr.

They're pushing it as some sort of ultra luxury destination...except its in Okhla, which is an industrial area. I used to have my office in the area and its literally one of the shittiest areas in the entire city. There is a literal trash mountain right next to the development

Not that development has even started yet. They're advertising $1M apartments built near trash heaps witg delivery scheduled around Modi's next term.

The situation in Gurgaon seems to be even more insane. There are apartment complexes built in the middle of nowhere with not a single street light for miles being advertised for crores.

Meanwhile if you wanted an apartment in the already established, well settled areas in DLF Phase 3, you can get them for half the price

Back in my hometown of Jaipur, apartments rates are equally out of whack. You can pay 1cr for an apartment in Vaishali Nagar...or you can buy a piece of land 100 meters away from the apartment and built a little mansion of your own for less than 1cr

My brain is not really able to compute any of this. 5cr apartments that are not even 50% ready built in the middle of nowhere? Who is buying them? More importantly, why are they buying them?

At this point, I feel that I will keep renting all my life. Not because I can't afford a house, but because nothing about the Indian property market seems rational to me. I make very substantial money but I refuse to participate in this utter irrationality

Scheduled,[Scheduled]The population debate: The depopulation phase of India and it's impact of the economy,"Here's a question:
We know through stats that around 2050-60, the population the country will fall down, and with an estimated 2-digit trillion economy, we will see the rise of the GDP per capita.

This is all WITH the current TFR (It is at a replacement rate). Now we change some data shall we? The goverment decides that from tomorrow, would apply mandatory childless policies. It's illegal to procreate and people would need to adopt children if they want to be, you know, parents. Amazing! Orphans would get new homes and they are really happy (Let us assume, they law is perfectly enforced).

The TFR would fall down below the replacement rate, ensuring population WILL fall down. However, there's this problem: We have a lot old people, and the thing is *they can't work*. Especially a country like India, where there is huge population and on top of that: *a huge old population*. How are we going to give them pensions? Government would *spend* more than *gain* more? An old poor population isn't a very good incentive for FDI either. How are we going to tackle the massive grey population we have?

Ninja edit: some words

I received an interview call for one of the research institutes in US for PhD. They have invited me to appear for an interview in Kansas with a nonimmigrant B visa. My interview is scheduled in Feb 13th. 

I have filled up the DS-160 form. I currently live in Andhra Pradesh. When I tried to schedule an appointment at US consulate in Hyderabad, it is giving the earliest date of appointment in April. I tried the same for Chennai, Kolkata and Mumbai where the appointment date available is Feb 10. In New Delhi the earliest appointment date available is Jan 17th. Goin by this 

I am at loss as to what to do at this point. Is there any way I can expediate the whole process? Can I even apply for  appointment in other US consulate (ex-New Delhi) given that I live in Andhra Pradesh now.

I don't know if applying for emergency visa will work or not? Please suggest me what should I do at this point. I do not want to lose the opportunity to pursue a grad degree. Thank you."

Scheduled,(CONFESSION) In a Dilemma,"Alright, this is a follow-up to a post I made a week back regarding me feeling stuck in a job that I really like but also, one that expects me to show up for work all 7 days.

I seem to have trouble giving a link to my first post here as upon posting, I get a message saying that it is awaiting approval. Been trying to do it for a couple of hours and I felt by then, the post would have gotten stale and old to be seen by others, in the feed.

A few days back, while leaving for the day after de-briefing with my boss, he noticed me looking tired than usual (really was dull and tired that day) and told me if there's anything wrong with me. I told him there's nothing wrong but he insisted. Since it's been only 3 months since I joined work, my probation period was coming to an end. I told him that whatever issue that I have, I'll discuss with him during my performance review that would have likely been conducted after the probation got over.

But, he insisted sharing whatever was bothering me and thus, I spilled it out - that a 7 day working schedule is too much for me to handle and that I might not be a fit in this industry (note that I've mentioned ""industry"" and not the ""company"") in the long run (It's a food and beverage industry). I told him a day off in a week is all I expect. For which, he told me that he is fine with me taking a break every week as long as I don't take it on a Sunday, as the production team too, will start demanding days-off.

I guess, it is kinda reasonable but still, I find it odd that there's no day-off by default and that I have to take one from my part. But that's kinda resolved, right? Except this isn't the problem.....

When he inquired me as to what my long-term goals are, I told him (and have told him prior, even on my interview) that my endgame is to become a professor in the field of Humanities or a psychologist. He kinda dismissed that desire of mine and told me flat-out that I am not a ""professor material"" as I am shy, reserved and socially awkward who lacks people skills. He told me that the role that I am in, right now, is what I was made to do due to how good and ""exemplary"" I have been, in these three months it seems.

He broke down in detail and gave (what I feel) was a worst-case estimate as to how my desire won't work out for me and told me that he too was in my place when he was my age - confused and ""lacking a sense of direction"" and told me as to how he earned this place due to sheer hard work and asked me data to back-up my claim of becoming a teacher, when I told him my desire was purely based on intuition (he told me to not ""hide behind such a pretext"").

Honestly, I felt humiliated, insulted and destroyed after the conversation. This is the first time someone is telling me that I am not a professor material. As, based on previous interactions with some of my classmates, friends and even my teachers, almost everyone agreed that I have what it took to become one. But, boss was a highly educated guy who has had tons of XP with life and is sitting in this position out of his sheer hard work and dedication and so, he implied that by not taking his advice, I am losing a great opportunity and going on a path in ruining my life.

I felt so patronized and the entire conversation reeked of condescension, from his part. I literally could not tell anything from my defense and told him that I'll prove him wrong somehow.

Tbh, I never even told that I was planning on quitting....all I said was that the schedule was too much for me and so, I'll give a few more months only after which, I might call ""quits"". He told me to quit asap if that was the case, as he does not wish to invest and spend any further on me as it was go to waste, once I quit and thus, he'll have to find another one and have to start the entire thing from scratch all over again. Which is very understandable and fair, as I never thought about it from that perspective.

Honestly though, I did not know quitting a job will be this emotionally draining and intensive. I thought it would be cold, formal process but no....they patronized, guilt-tripped me and made me feel absolutely terrible and worthless.

He has given me two days time to come to a conclusion and based on what I wrote in my previous post, I am still stumped and at a loss in taking a decision based on the perks and privileges I enjoy here. But the whole interaction has left me with a bad taste in my mouth - no one patronizes me and dictates me into telling what I should be and what I cannot be and insult, mock and belittle my desires and dreams under the pretext of being ""honest, rational and practical"".

Maybe my desires are impractical but, it could have been broken down to me in a better way.

(Sorry for the long post and please read my previous post that I have linked in the first paragraph, to get a better context)."

Scheduled,I am from Shaheen Bagh and I hope the protest here ends.,"I remember the day of violence at Jamia university. I had just come from office and one of my friend who was in the rally that had tried marching towards parliament and as soon as it had reached Mathura Road, a major road in Delhi, the rally faced an unexpected amount of force from police, a violent lathi-charge. He said, people ran in all directions and cops chased them all over. Next thing he sees is buses burning, police firing gun on protestors. 

All I said to him is, "" I wish people didn't protest because this will not yield anything"", he didn't believe me so, I switched on my TV and showed him the narrative that was spun on the incident by media. He was shocked. Next day Shaheen Bagh protest started and rest is history. But never once did I think from day one that BJP will talk or courts will intervene. And never believed that this was a good idea as Shaheen Bagh road is major thoroughfare between Noida , Delhi, Faridabad and Gurgaon and hence it will only make more haters because I know most people don't really care what the Indian Muslim thinks. 

It has all come true, and today as more than ever, I wish this protest ended. 

I was brought up in India and never did I consider this country to be more than a Hindu nation, with Muslims living in their ""aukaat"". I grew up watching Mahabharata, Ramayana and om namah shivay on government owned national television, visited government offices with temples and other unlimited signs of Hinduism in government that established that. As you grew older, met kids who had never met a Muslim and knew zilch about Islam but could tell you 100s of stereotypes about Muslims as facts. Countless incidents made an imprint on you and you learnt to keep your head down and just live in your ghetto. But now my ghetto, which is chose for security over facilities is gone. 

But the thing is, I had learnt to live with that. But this protest makes me feel unsafe. I feel noticed. I don't want that. Till this protest , nobody knew what was Shaheen Bagh, I liked that. Now I feel exposed and worried that I might have crossed my ""aukaat"" and will soon feel the punishment for it. So please my friends at the protest, please stop it.



PS: just my rant, thought, don't downvote because you don't agree, kindly comment or else move on.

Edit : I also do not want the protest to end. You have to understand that as a Muslim in India, I am used to keeping my head down and going on with life. But this, this is totally new. This is a revolt of a sort, which totally makes lots of people among us nervous, we get these thoughts and I just articulated it here. Thank you all for the support and understanding."

Scheduled,Mental Health Therapy service for NRIs,"Hey Everyone,

**tl;dr – if you are like me, I want to arrange free online therapy for you (with a small catch).**

Big fan of this sub. It's been really great to read news about India and be able to discuss it. 

**About Me**

My name is Prakash. My family is from Kerala and I grew up in Hong Kong. After my primary and secondary school there, I ended up going to the Bay Area for university. After 7 years in the Bay, I moved back to India in order to work (believed that there were interesting things happening in consumer tech).

I’ve also had depression since I was 12, ended up getting hospitalized for it and then spent significant time figuring out how to manage it with a therapist.

What really helped me was moving back to India and being able to talk to a therapist who could understand the specific cultural issues that I was going through. I didn’t have the greatest relationship with my parents and it was sometimes really difficult to get a handle on my more negative thought patterns. My decision to move back to India was also really hard - lots of family members questioning my sanity and a lot of self doubt (am I stupidly just chasing risk?). Finally, I had a lot of insecurity about how I looked because I was usually the only brown person in the rooms I was moving in (and Hong Kong is not the most accepting place for people of colour).

**What I’m trying to do**

After having spent time both abroad and in India, I realized that there weren’t that many therapists abroad that could understand where I was coming from and that my Indian therapist was a lot more effective because of our shared cultural background.

I’m currently trying to see if other people feel this way, so here’s what I’m proposing -

Go to this website [www.talkfreely.uk](https://www.talkfreely.uk/) and sign up.

I’ll reach out to you via email and schedule a weekly online session with a therapist.

For the first 5 weeks, this service will be free, after which it will cost you roughly 20 pounds per hour (or your equivalent local currency).

In return, you and I jump on a short call every week so you can help me iron out the operational kinks. I want to get feedback on what’s effective and what’s not, so that I can make the service better.

**Caveats**

If you’re facing really SERIOUS depression or another serious mental health disorder, DO NOT use this service. You need to get professional help in person.

If you’re in the US, you unfortunately **can’t use** this service because of regulation. If you’re in the UK, Singapore, HK, Dubai…you’re fine. The pricing is set in pounds, but I'm happy to convert to the currency of your choice."

Scheduled,How to deal with a HR who just stood you up?,"So I'm a Mechanical Engineer currently working and I had recently applied for a position in one big MNC for a job which was in line with my experience. So I get a call back for an interview. They ask me to be there on a very short notice I asked for an extension. So the HR suggests a skype interview. I agree and confirm her via mail. I put in an sick leave and stayed home for this interview. It was scheduled in the morning. But I never received a call. I called them back every time she said she'll check and let me know. I was sitting at home all dressed for the entire day waiting for a call. At least she should have said it'll be postponed or something. But no. Even at 5 pm when I called she said she'll get back to me in a minute. Again nothing. Now I don't know what to do. Do i mail her asking how they can play around with people's time?

Scheduled,Do you feel that Point of view of general public is slightly changed about our PM after yesterday's events?,"I mean come on, you've got to give him some credit. He landed in bengaluru from two day visit of Russia at afternoon of 7th September. In a day he did meet few people, went to ISRO center at 1:30 AM midnight of 8th September, stayed there late until 2:45 AM, though mission did not go as planned & though with heavy heart he left the place after giving a small speech of encouragement to scientists. Immediately in morning at 8:00 AM, he gave speech at ISRO, Bengaluru facility acknowledging scientists & the nation about Lander mission failure. After that we saw a moving interaction between crying ISRO chief and PM comforting him. This interaction really gave me chills and will be forever etched on my memory. A PM of nation comforting a crying ISRO chief on his shoulders. 

Well, If you think he stopped there, then you are mistaken. He immediately embarked plane to attain the inauguration ceremony of launch of new Mumbai metro lines. He gave a speech there. But before that he didn't forget to attain a 100th anniversary of local Ganapati Mandal. At noon he left Mumbai for Aurangabad, to facilitate 8th crore beneficiary under Ujjwala scheme and to open First Greenfield Smart city there. Another speech. And lastly at the end of the day, he was planned to visit Nagpur but due to heavy rains forecast he unfortunately had to cancel.

Now you tell me, at his age who works this harder for nation?  Do we really deserve him? And will people now be little kinder to him?"

Had extremely extremely high social anxiety, 0 confidence, followed by crippling depression. Ideas like I will never be able to earn money etc. Now: social anxiety is so less, its completely crazy.  Almost gone is several cases.

Realize depression, anxiety WILL go away. You are wrong if you think your anxiety can't go away or you won't be confident. Same with depression, curable. Get this in your head.

Things that actually really worked with me:

1. Sunlight! My psychiatrist told me. 1 hr daily. Direct sunlight on your head, neck areas, ideally within 3 hrs on waking. He also suggested about an option of buying some lights that do the same thing.
2. Sleep schedule is very important !! Cannot be stressed enough. Something I ignored for years! Even now its not perfect. But wake early after 7-8 hrs of sleep. Wake at 6AM, go outside in the morning breeze.
3. Exercise. Strength exercise specifically. At least for me. Its not about muscles. Your body, you, feel different. I didn't know back muscles could be flexed. Don't attempt to rush it though. Make it a medium term plan to become physically stronger. Start slow, stretch, jog, walk. Avoid injuries. took 4-5 months to feel results. 

Confidence is not magic. Nor is depression a mystery. Think scientifically. Human body has evolved for millions of years in a certain environment - with open areas, lot of sunlight, doing hard labour. In the absence of sunlight, living in a cave with a weak body, our body is in unknown waters. Issues are bound to happen imo."

Scheduled,Vegetarianism in India has more to do with caste hierarchy than love for animals,"
Why do vegetarians in India prefer social distance from non-vegetarians? A look at caste-wise food preferences could provide some insights. As is common knowledge, the ranking of castes is mostly influenced by purity of occupation and diet. In caste-society, to achieve purity of body and spirit, it is necessary to be a vegetarian and religious simultaneously – something best embodied by a Brahmin.

The percentage of non-vegetarians among Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, both for men and women, is much higher than among those who are not from these communities. And in the latter group, the highest incidence of vegetarianism is found among Brahmins at almost over 50%. The higher the caste, the greater the possibility of them being pure vegetarians.

The burden of diet-purity and vegetarianism is, however, more on women than men.

Broadly, present-day vegetarianism in India constitutes a form of moral power of minority within Hindus, with such a power being forced on the non-vegetarian majority – with their consent. This new sociality is a sign of progress in modern caste belief where the seductive power of vegetarianism and its associated purity travels seamlessly across bodies and spaces without dissent.

How fragile must the morals of the vegetarian castes be if they feel threatened by the introduction of eggs for poor children in schools? The morals of Indian vegetarians continue to be based less on compassion for humans and animals, and more driven by ideas of hierarchy and purity. In this scheme of hierarchy, one who eats beef is placed at the lowest rung. Like humans of caste, not all animals carry equal sympathy: there exists some hierarchy where the cow (indigenous, not jersey) takes the highest sacral form compared to the rest. Gandhi improvised his vegetarianism through inflicting violence and control on the self. Present-day caste-subjects and their vegetarianism, however, thrive on violence, both on the self and others. The state across India through various governments has mostly been party to this process, promoting the hegemony of misguided vegetarianism."

Scheduled,Can Indians grow a spine already?,"I am so sick of Indian men and women being pressured into arranged marriages. I am sick of the whole virginity being the sacred bowl of purity, sick of aunties who will keep on nagging you to get married. This is absurd. 

Everyone puts up the whole, 'Arranged marriages are done with consent' bs. Are they though? Deep inside everyone knows that the majority of the Indian population is pressured into marriage. 

Let's see, if someone pressures you to have sex, it is *sexual assault*, right? It is a crime. You shouldn't be pressured into *anything*, not even marriage. I can't believe how manipulative parents can get, 'I will slit my wrists if you don't get married', 'You will see my dead face if you don't get married'. Here's the thing, taking your own life needs a *lot of courage*, trust me, I have tried. *Your parents won't take their own lives for this*. You are an adult, probably earning, you can take care of yourself and take your own decisions. *Please don't be pressured and ruin two lives*, hell maybe 3 lives, if we assume that you will have a child. I am from a dysfunctional family, arranged marriage, of course, and my life has been hell. I remember wishing that my parents never got married, even if it resulted in me not being in this world. 

Here's the thing, life's already complicated, you need to earn, do your job, take care of yourself and others, etc, why make life more difficult with things that don't need to be complicated. Socialize, date, make friends, find common interests, know each other for *years*, marry. That's how biology of the body is. 

Some say that arranged marriages have a courtship period, but how long does it last? The maximum amount of time I have seen someone just being engaged in an arranged marriage is 1 year. Not to mention, the courtships can be in an controlled environment and fixed meeting and schedules. How can you be sure your partner wants to marry? Hell, how can you be sure? Is it because *this is just the next step*? What if your sexual libidos, kinks don't match?
 I, for a fact know that I won't marry someone until I have know them for atleast 3 years! It's sad to see where the society is going. You can say that that's how the culture of India is, but does the culture have any value if it suppresses and unnaturalizes the whole concept of love and relationships, the way biology works? If it affects mental health? After all, isn't culture just man-made? Only the positive aspects of culture should be kept. Relationships, sex, love are natural. Nothing *sacred*. If you want arrange marriage, good for you, just make sure your partner has *actually consented*.

Sincerely, a rant by me. Seeing my dear best friend in depression after being emotionally blackmailed into a marriage with same threats of suicide, 'log kya kahenge', etc has been terrible. Know that parents are not Gods, they are humans whom you should definitely respect but they *do* make mistakes. Even if love marriage doesn't work, you have yourself to blame, not your parents and part in your own terms. If you are pressured into a marriage, how can you say that you won't be pressured to no divorce? 

Stand up for yourself.

Edit: This is amusing. I would like to point out few things,

1) I am not claiming that *all* arranged marriages are forced. I have just stated how forced marriages do happen. Some people have taken it personally.  *I just feel it is projection*.
2) Many people are denying this, but it happens. A lot. To the point that it is so normalized that you don't feel it. *This is not a village thing. The friend I mentioned is from Mumbai*.
3) The ""I am a virgin, I want a virgin"". Okay, good for you, it's just, I feel that you are insecure about yourself. Atleast, that's how it looks like to me, as  a girl. (Oh, I am a *virgin* girl, so don't come at spewing shit like, ""You had sex that's why you don't want virginity to be considered""). If not, tell me why your partner's virginity matters to you, if it's not insecurity. It's a preference? Well, why is it? I mean, given the trend in the comments, most of you want to marry for sex. Which defiles marriage in itself, which you claim is sacred.
4) if calling me names, saying I am a weak shit for pointing out the obvious things happening in the society *and denying that it happens* makes you feel better, well, you do you. Classic ad hominem. Oh, you can say that I am generalising, and you know what, maybe I am, because generalizations always have a bit of truth of the society in them.
5) ""I won't get a good looking girl if I don't have an arranged marriage"". Oh my, that is so shallow. Just like a girl asking for 6 figures is wrong, then so is you asking for a good looking girl. Don't cry foul that women want money and gold diggers when you are just as shallow as them. I guess the quote should go, 'Don't judge a person until it's time for marriage'.
6) MARRIAGE IS NOT A CONTRACT AND DEFINITELY NOT A PASS FOR SEX. If you are marrying just for sex,   you are pitiful. Screams lack of confidence in yourself. People need to work on themselves, you don't get things you want just by sitting and hoping to get it. Since, most arguments are from men here, I have noticed that they are happy that they don't have to do anything and their parents get them a bride and sex while the bride gets 'financial security'. Reminds me of how you have to pay a prostitute to get sex, except here, it has a better name. 

Again, I would like to clear that I am against 'forced arranged marriages', though I am not a huge fan of the business like transaction of arranged marriages, what people want is none of concern. People have started bashing it as if I am totally against arranged marriage. Though, I have tried to counter the points which have been posted in defense of arranged marriage (and I didn't find them convincing). Though most of them argue about how arranged marriages are not bad, which I agree. *It's just how it happens here, is bad*. And I have tried to counter them too, though those have no relation to the whole point of the post. Which is how many are being forced into marriage and how it is so normalized in the present society.

Oof, formatting in reddit sucks. And I have realized that India has a *long, long* way to go. 

*Pretty ironic. A country in which romantic movies are usually the highest grossing, shuns love in real life.*

Scheduled,Indigo flight to chandigarh overbooked passengers stranded.,"So, flight 6E 592 from Bangalore to Chandigarh Indigo airlines has been overbooked by indigo. These guys came to know about this when boarding bus was at the door of aircraft with 50-70 passengers still in boarding bus. 

We have kept the flight stranded for now.

But such irresponsible behaviour from indigo has left all of us in jiffy. We are standing at tarmac currently.

Will update.

Please upvote this for visibility. These are such malicious practices. How can they have overbooked so much.

Update1: so indigo guys scheduled same flight to two different places instead of two. And passengers for other location (I couldn't get that) have not be allowed to board.
Now they have boarded all the Chandigarh passengers.
But rest are still stranded. I am on board but still there are atleast 30 people stranded. This is some pathetic show by indigo

Also I am not sure whether i will get my luggage today.

Okay will update after I reach Chandigarh airplane mode time. Hope these guys don't remain stranded here for long.

Real shit show by indigo

Update 2: Reached Chandigarh got my luggage.

About the whole fiasco. Seems like those passengers were going to Amritsar and Indigo cancelled their flights and tried to put them on Chandigarh flight and a further passage to Amritsar. Now due to almost complete show by Chandigarh passengers ,Amritsar guys were stopped from boarding.
TLDR: seems like indigo miscalculated the no show and caused stranded passengers
 Edit: https://www.flightstats.com/v2/flight-tracker/6E/592

Scheduled,We compiled the absolute best ways for Indians to pass time during this lockdown,"For the past few days my team and I have been trying to figure out ways to fight against COVID19 digitally and positively. We believe it’s super important for Indians to stay level-headed & use this lockdown as an opportunity to spend some quality time with their families. In India, as we grow older and start working, we often forget about our old hobbies & the things which we used to enjoy when we were younger. 

This lockdown will last a minimum of 21 days, and everyone needs to find quality activities to fill their schedule with & things to enjoy with their families.


To solve this, [we've launched IndiaSmile](https://indiasmile.org/): A one-stop resource for the best things to do while stuck in quarantine, with a unique indian context. What's more, it's 100% non-profit and open source!


It contains:

* Best movies and TV shows to watch -- Hindi & English

* Home workout tutorials for Cardio, Yoga, Strength, and flexibility.

* Guides and apps for managing anxiety and social isolation

* Community chat to discuss & engage with

* Unbiased, scientific news

* Learning resources 


We're trying to benefit the community by providing carefully curated lists of content to consume and resources to follow, regularly updated by a team of dedicated citizens.


The IndiaSmile WhatsApp communities section aims to provide more social connections by only permitting authentic and positive content. 


We have also added [a tool to check the nearest confirmed covid case to your current safe location](https://indiasmile.org/nearme/).


Tech details: lean PWA (Progressive Web App) using Nuxt, built to have negligible load times and be super performant on all devices (especially the slower Indian ones). Offline first and heavily cached to provide extreme performance. [Completely open source & non profit](https://github.com/IndiaSmile). 


Open to contribution, ideas, and thoughts. How can we truly make this a genuine resource to help every indian successfully go through this unprecedented lockdown?

Scheduled,"[AskIndia] Fathers/mothers of Reddit India, what were the 38-41 weeks of pregnancy like for you? Long post ahead.","Hi everyone!

I am currently in my 25th week (late 2nd trimester) and I'm trying to educate myself about what lies ahead for me. I have to zero in on the most important decision - the city of birth (job city?/my hometown?/husband's hometown?). I need to decide this ASAP as traveling after 28 weeks(April end that is) is generally not advised.

Which brings me to making this post here. I want to gather all the information/anectodes/experiences, in a countdown way, about the D-Day/D-weeks. If the circumstances allow, I would prefer a normal delivery. However, I totally understand how uncertain pregnancies can get. I just feel being informed can help us stay less anxious & not panic. Its going to be long and my thoughts might seem all over the place, so please bear with me. Here are my questions:

1) How frequent are the scheduled* OB/GYN visits in the very last month, assuming a normal pregnancy? Currently I visit once a month, for routine check up and milestone/mandated tests (flu vaccination, various blood tests, sonography, etc)

*(By scheduled I mean no complication was experienced by the woman or any urgency(water breaking, bleeding, etc) occured)

2) One lady who had the same OBGYN as me when went for her scheduled 37th week visit, was told she will have a C-Section as the child is getting overweight (weighing 3 kgs then). The OBGYN asked her to soon decide which date she would like the surgery to happen and let the doctor know. The lady said she however got labor pain the very next day and delivered via vaginal delivery. Now, I am a little skeptical here; from what I've read, **2.5-3.5 kgs is the average birth weight for newborns in India**. How can 3 kgs be overweight then? I'm already very paranoid about the state of deliveries in urban, big-name hospitals and this incident scares me more. There is no data public on the number of normal and surgical deliveries a hospital has, so that one can decide, and once you're in, you're in. After that, you have to leave everything at the doctor.

3) One lady who delivered at the same hospital (different OBGYN) as me, went at 37 weeks when she felt contractions. Her cervix was examined twice in a 5 hour span. She said she couldn't bear going through that painful examination again and asked for a C-Section herself (totally fair). My question is, are these cervix examinations by hand so necessary, when they're leaving the bearing lady in pain? Is there no other way (imaging, ultrasound, etc)? My point is those contractions could have been what is called 'false labor' and if not for the pain due to the examination, that lady could have gone home and come again full-term or when she felt contractions again?

4) My sister went for a scheduled visit in 38th week. Her cervix was examined, she started bleeding. She was told to come back if bleeding continued till evening, which it did. She had to be operated the next day, after staying in labor room for some 24-32 hours. This again makes me skeptical about cervix examinations.

5) What's the countdown going to be like? When does one know that ""yes, its now that I rush to the hospital."" Should I be scared of just a few drops of blood? Should I rush the very first time I experience period like cramps? From my few interactions with mothers, I feel 37-38 weeks is the sweet spot where many things happen. I know my post gives a lot of distrusting vibes towards doctors, that they're there to loot us, they try to 'invent' some complication in these sweet spot weeks to push for C-Sections, etc. Trust me, I would like to be proven wrong. Hence, I'm here to collect as much anectodes about false alarms, doctor sending the lady home even after mild contractions as its not time yet instead of asking to schedule a C-Section, etc as I can.

5) From what I understand, some women might never experience labor even after 40-41 weeks and hence have to be induced. Are some women induced before that too? What could lead to induction before full term?

6) Do all women having a vaginal delivery get an epidural/other pain medication, or only those who demand it when they get tired, or when they can't bear pain?

7) Did anyone research natural birth centers? There are many in the major cities, like 1) Sanctum Birth Center, Hyderabad, 2) Birth Village, Kochi, 3) Daimaas Natural Birth Center, Mumbai, 4) Apollo Cradle, Gurugram. Google reviews are mixed. Anyone undertook the services of these natural birth centers?

So everyone, contribute what you can towards my questions & in general, your pregnancy stories."
Scheduled,ok lets have some serious talk,"i am going to get straight to the point I think that the schedule caste  system is corrupt and if being misused by that I mean that it is a wrong privilege for SC,s to get special treatment for ex  more chance in exams even if they score low or not  which means that the general is kind of being discriminated I am no expert at law so take what I say with a grain of salt 

then the point is that if the government didn't want  SC,s to be discriminated  then they should take away their privilege's  as most  hatred and discrimination by the general class toward the SC,s is that they now have an outright advantage in academics and college enrollment

Scheduled,February Goals >>>>>>>>,"February Goals

It's been a little late for me to make resolutions for this year but we live in present and not past.

I think we all have the ability and audacity to think good and even exceptional things for ourselves. And I've learnt two things in life till now: whatever your goals are, let people know about it. It does two things: Firstly, people around you will help out and the secondly it will make you committed / liable.

So here it is:

Since I'm into public accounting and auditing, I've set a goal for myself to work with one of the big4 (**Deloitte, EY, PWC and KPMG**) in second half of 2020. 

For me it's a big deal to be a part of multinational and reputed accounting firms around the world. And I think it also serves a justice to my degrees as well.

So I've mapped out a plan which will help me in achievement of my goal. 

1. Everyday I would try to connect and speak with at least 1 recruiter and 3 people who are/were associate with those companies.
2. I will have my CV made from someone professional and experienced in this industry.
3. I will attend as many as networking events as possible and recite the same thing again to every person I come across in the hope of getting a connection somehow.
4. Try to schedule informational interviews if that's a thing in Dubai.
5. Make a professional video about my profile and upload it over social media.
6. Even I'll go one step further, upload all those networking and informational interviews videos on Youtube.
7. Maybe even run my Facebook and instagram ads against people who work in these organizations.
8. Last but not the least, prepare for that final day, EVERY SINGLE FUCKING DAY.

Now that would be it from my side and I'll leave out rest things on LUCK. 

Three things gonna happen from this post:

1. No-one responds (which is intact even worse) and I'll get on to my to-do list and check off every item listed above.
2. Someone who actually care about helping others and either work in these organisations or know someone there who can make things move would reach out to me.
3. And last one would be ones who will rant about everything.

Or just help me out on how to meet people and network with people over here in this part of the world? Coz I really want this thing man."

Important controversial Judgement: Justice Goel’s judgment on prevention of misuse of SC/ST Act in Dr. Shubhash Kashinath Mahajan vs. The State of Maharashtra, is one of the much talked about decision. Justice Goel along with Justice Lalit examined the question on the inclusion of procedural safeguards so that the provisions of Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) (SC/ST) Act 1989 are not abused for extraneous considerations. The Bench held that, a Government official cannot be prosecuted on mere allegation of committing an offence under the Act without the sanction of appointing authority. [1](https://www.indialegallive.com/constitutional-law-news/courts-news/justice-ak-goel-retires-from-sc-defends-his-judgment-in-sc-st-act-51270) [2](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/justice-ak-goel-who-ruled-on-dalit-atrocities-law-retires-from-top-court-1879280)

***So what about him?***

Let's go back to Vajpayee's government when Arun Jaitley was Minister of Law and Justice.

From Article: [Govt ignored IB report on HC judge](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Govt-ignored-IB-report-on-HC-judge/articleshow/45701970.cms).

>*High court judges are appointed in the following way: The state government sends a list of names through the governor to the chief justices of the Supreme Court and the concerned high court. This list is then sent to the law ministry, which obtains an IB report on the nominees. Thereafter, it prepares a matrix with three criteria â€” professional competence, integrity and political links.*  
>  
>*In the case of Goel, the law ministry matrix contains no entry under the ''Professional Competence'' column, while the ''Reputation/Integrity'' column bluntly says: ""Corrupt person"".*  
>  
>*The key to his subsequent appointment appears to be the listing in the political affiliation column, which notes that Goel was general secretary of the All-India Adhiwakta Parishad, the lawyers'' wing of the RSS.

# [Arun Kumar Mishra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arun_Kumar_Mishra)

He is a judge of the [Supreme Court of India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India), former [Chief Justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Justice) of the [Calcutta High Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcutta_High_Court) and the [Rajasthan High Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasthan_High_Court), and a former justice of the [Punjab and Haryana High Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_and_Haryana_High_Court)

The Caravan Magazine says and I quote

>*the collegium had thrice considered and decided against Mishra’s nomination; on one of these occasions, it had asked for a background check on him. According to an article in the Economic and Political Weekly, the check revealed that Mishra was close to the RSS. Any prior reservations were evidently put aside with the advent of the Modi government.*

\[But I couldn't search in *Economic and Political Weekly, If anyone finds the article, please do comment \].*

AK Mishra has been known for his BJP favouring judgements. [1](https://theprint.in/report/friend-of-cji-misra-target-supreme-court-judges-ire/28323/) [2](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/contempt-threat-to-lawyer-justice-arun-mishra-apologises/articleshow/72380063.cms) [3](https://frontline.thehindu.com/the-nation/article29897723.ece)

### Along with these 2 appointments, [The Union Law Ministry has turned down the elevation of the former Solicitor-General of India, Gopal Subramanium, as a judge of the Supreme Court](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/law-ministry-turns-down-gopal-subramaniums-elevation-as-sc-judge/article6127460.ece)

>*As an* [*amicus curiae*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amicus_curiae) *in the Sohrabuddin fake encounter case, Mr. Subramanium targeted the Narendra Modi government in Gujarat with new facts and was instrumental in the apex court ordering a CBI probe into the case. He was also the amicus curiae in the Sree Padmanabhaswamy temple case.*

Well, none of these are wrong to someone who considers RSS-BJP as a group run by pristine men.

This series is not for them, but for those who have recognised the RSS-BJP as fas\_ist forces but fail to understand what went soo wrong with our great judicial system.

Scheduled,Late Night Random Discussion Thread !,
Scheduled,Does anyone know how the PMNRF that we are all donating to (Prime Minister National Relief Fund) is utilised?,"In last year alone, PMNRF had a surpluse of 570.68 crores in 2018-19. As per the FAQs section, these funds can be utilised for medical assistance, floods, drought, terrorist violence and other unforeseen occurrences. Indians who are either affected by these calamities or who require financial aid for treatment of major diseases at Government/PMNRF empanelled hospitals can partially defray the expenses. Has anyone ever directly benefited by the scheme? Funny, FAQ Q18 reads as 'since a large number of requests are received seeking financial assistance for medical treatment, it is not possible to accommodate all requests due to limited resources.'
Limited resources? They had 570.68 crores in surplus from just one year? 
Also it is mentioned that the balance amount(which are significant surplus since 2011-12) is ""invested"" in various forms with scheduled banks and other agencies to ensure long term sustainability. So, about 75% of last year's funds are ""invested""?
We keep getting posts on r/india of doctors working with limited resources and have a lack of proper protective equipments. Why haven't been a lot of these funds transferred in times of crisis or better, for improvement of healthcare facilities? 
Does anyone know about how these funds are disbursed? Is there any answer to why such a huge amount is kept reserved? Has anyone ever directly received financial aids from this fund?

Scheduled,Is this an idea that can be executed at some level ?,"Get a group of doctors to digitally ( via phone /video chat) ,connect with elderly (over the age of 60) on a daily basis.
Each doctor can be assigned 50 elderly people. They will schedule a 10 min check in with them daily via video conferencing.
This will ensure that we cover the age group most susceptible to coronavirus and identify cases which may begin to crop up among the elderly. Early identification may lead to lesser victims.

I haven't made the population calculations as to how many doctors we would need , but since this is a remote thing , I believe there can be some level of planning around this."

Scheduled,Pros and cons of living in Hyderabad. Feel free to add your perspectives or discuss how your city is better than Hyderabad in the cons department I mentioned here,"Pros - 

- It's affordable for anybody. 

- Enough uptown cafes and clubs for anyone to explore.

- The distances aren't nearly as far as other metro cities. Travelling the entire stretch of the city shouldn't take longer than 2 hours. 

- The metro makes connectivity to all major areas areas and landmarks easier. The only place it isn't covered is probably Attapur and towards the Airport. 
 
- The airport is almost equidistant from all major residential areas. 

- IT/Corporate hub! Don't have to say more. There are enough opportunities for everybody.  Gachibowli and Hi-Tech city are so well developed that being a resident of this very city, I'm still in awe at how cool the corporate buildings are everytime I go to that part of the town. 

- It's relatively safe, for women especially. Keyword - relatively. You have creeps and psychopaths everywhere, but there are lesser crimes reported from Hyderabad.

- Most locals are welcoming and helpful.

- The GHMC and Hyderabad traffic police are responsible enough to act on infrastructural shortcomings, the regular water logging and the flow of traffic. They make communication easier with their WhatsApp numbers and apps. It's upto you to be outspoken and giving them information via their social media and helpline numbers.

- You see Hindus and Muslims especially living together in harmony. Temples and Masjids literally right next to each other. 
They're really indifferent to whatever the political mood is at the center. It's a good kind of indifference. You almost never see protests or violence in the name of religion, and this city should really be the hallmark of communal harmony for anyone to follow.

- Less traffic during the weekends so you can schedule your recreational plans then.

Cons -

- It's polluted, overpopulated, has a lot of traffic, but this can be said about any major Indian city.

- You have to haggle a lot with autos. They never follow the meter. 

- A lack of last mile connectivity from metro stations to short radiuses. Makes me change plans or compromise with visiting places which are just walkable from metro stations.

- Uber and Ola autos cancel on you if you pay online and not physical cash. 
Uber and Ola do surge a lot and you have to be ready to pay over a 100 to just travel 2-3km.  But again, this holds true for any Indian city and not particularly Hyderabad. 

- RTC buses are a nightmare. Unusable.

- It takes trial and error to know what routes have the worst traffic and around what times during the day/during what festivals. Traffic from Tank Bund is diverted during some festivals because of religious procession. Google maps can't be relied upon completely. 

- Secunderabad has the worst traffic. I was stuck in traffic for over an hour to reach a place which was just 3km away. 

- The weather is harsh - extremely hot summers and very cold winters. You have to be privileged enough to have air conditioning to survive the 45° +  summers. 
Off late, it's not even been raining as much during the monsoon months, and that is concerning in the long run.

- Lack of good colleges and universities for commerce and the arts. There are no good private universities or colleges for the non engineering fields. The Central University called Osmania University has the worst and most redundant curriculums. 
It's however, slightly better for post graduate management education.  
 
- I personally want Hyderabad to have more hobbyist events and activities in terms of art, literature, public speaking, etc. It is at a good place, but still not ""woke enough"" if I may. It can get better. 

Summed up everything I could think of.

I've been living in Hyderabad for almost 8 years now, and I want to move to another city to grow as a person and gain more perspective. But I'm glad to have a place of my own in Hyderabad and be able to ""fall back"" here whenever I want. It's one of the best livable cities for Indian standards."

It began back in 2013 with a night shift job. I did the shift for a year but when I left the company my sleep schedule stayed the same. And now even after 7 years it is the same. Even I am to blame since after I left the job I did not try to fix my sleep times and prolonged it.

Since I am a freelancer now it doesn't affect my work but it is affecting all other aspects of my life. At times if I have to be up early I'm just miserable and cranky the whole day.

Scheduled,Most effective way to deal with Indian clients.,"Hi there.

I was hoping to trouble you for advice about how to deal Indian clients.

I'm a Sri Lankan criminal lawyer practicing in Canada.  My office is in an area with a large number of immigrants from South East Asia.

I don't want to generalize, but I've had some issues with Indian and Pakistani clients.  For one, despite being in an area with many Indian and Pakistani client, I've only retained very few Indian and Pakistani clients.

Despite only being retained by very few Indian clients,  I get a lot of calls and even visits from Indian individuals.  These people often try and take up as much time as possible and ask loads of questions but will refuse to sign up or pay for anything.  Because they're a large community in my area, they actually interfere with my practice by taking and energy time away from paying customers.   After many such visits, I've began to realize that they were only after free advice and not interested in buying anything.

Of course people of other races call for free advice from time to time as well.  But they are in 99% of cases honest about it, and polite about not taking up too much of my time.  Unfortunately the opposite is true for nearly 90% of Indian callers.

Also, I noticed that the few Indian customers I do get are demanding and not very good at keeping up with payment.

Of course this hasn't been the case with all Indian clients, some have been absolutely stellar.  However, it has been the case with way too many of them to the point where I realized I need a better strategy to deal with  it.  Of course, this only seems to apply to people who have immigrated from India or Pakistan relatively recently or people who haven't really integrated well to Canadian culture.  Indians who have integrated to Canadian culture are a joy to work with.  And because at least one person is bound to say it - yes I understand generalizations, not all Indians etc etc.

I realize this sounds like a rant  but it's not.  The reason I'm here is because I realized that there must be some of you who run service oriented businesses in India.   If I'm getting a disproportionate amount of this behavior from Indian clients, Indian businesses must get it alot from their clients.  My question is how do you deal with it?  How do you run an effective business under these conditions?

Do businesses in India have a method for spotting and  weeding out individuals who are looking for free advice and just wasting your time?   Do businesses in india have a strategy for dealing with difficult or demanding clients.   What strategies to Indian businesses employ to make sure payment schedule are met on time.   And finally, I'm starting to suspect that the main way to get Indian clients is through referrals through someone they know, is this suspicion accurate or is there another way to market effectively to Indian clients.

Basically what's the best way for a business owner to serve Indian clients without losing his mind?"

Scheduled,I Am Amazed and Inspired by Indian Youth,"I myself am not an Indian national. Rather, I am an American-born Pakistani. I have subscribed to this subreddit because I think it's important to understand the other half of the discussion. 

I don't want my idea of what Indians believe to be made up entirely of my family's steriotypes of what this community is. 

In addition to being of Pakistani descent and from a muslim family, I am also gay. I was shocked when India legalized gay marriage. I always thought Pakistani and Indian culture to be so similar. This was what piqued my interest in India. I wanted to gain a greater understanding of the mentality and political compass of Indians as far as I could understand it through Reddit (which I understand is not necessarily demonstrative of the majority of Indian voters).

Countless times I have been inspired by the Indian Reddit community's relentless efforts to cling to the secular identity of Indian political culture. Time and time again, I read about Indian pride for being the largest democracy. This is in most cases, within the context of a diverse community. People of every faith and every ethnicity all as Indian citizens sharing a common but spectacularly diverse culture.  

I am so glad that I chose to follow this subreddit or I probably wouldn't know that there is in fact a very large population of Indians who object to islamophobia or racist views of the vast subcultures of India. 

So I just wanted to thank everyone who stands for the Indian cultural ideal of tolerance and inclusiveness. It's very inspiring and I hope that bigots around the globe can learn a thing or two from this.

Edit: It has been pointed out that in fact gay marriage has not been legalized, rather, sodomy has been decriminalized. I stand corrected and apologize for this misconception. I do still however maintain that it is an excellent step in the right direction as another commenter has mentioned."

The first semester in Ist M.B.B.S goes very good, my problems begin in the second semester where i start having issues with my health.During this period i consulted many doctors. I'm unstable and bed ridden, taking multiple pain killers and muscle relaxants prescribed by them.The doctors aren't able to give me a diagnosis a few months pass keep in mind even in such a state I'm studying. I give my prelim examination and barely make it. I'm geared up to give my Ist M.B.B.S exam. My health takes a turn for the worst and now I'm unable to move, my parents come all the way from Kerala. They aren't able to see me in such a state and they take me back to Kerala . They get me checked up and within 2 days the competent doctor gives me the diagnosis, i have T.B spine. My parents are shell shocked, my mother starts crying. I felt numb. I felt helpless. My treatment schedule is put in place and i start with my medication. The treatment plan was for a year, with physiotherapy. Luckily the  vertebrae involved ankylosed without causing a need for surgical involvement. I healed physically. Now my treatment was done,  i was healthy. But during this period all the friends i had made in my college, were now strangers. I had become a social pariah. I didn't disclose my illness except to 1 close friend who was also from Kerala . He kept me updated on what was going on in college even though he had moved to the second year. I had completed my treatment and had to sit for the Ist M.B.B.S exam. With 2 months left after my treatment, i give it my all and with the grace of God i make it through. Now begins the second year, I'm with a completely new batch. I became a junior. Nobody knows who i am. I thought i get a fresh start. But slowly the news spreads and they get to know that I'm from their senior batch. Initially they assumed i was a transfer. Initially people tried making small talk with me and i was soon ""friends"" with a few of the people from this batch. Slowly i was isolated and my ""seniors"" wanted nothing to do with me. I was completely alone, even my close friend got busy with his life and abandoned me aswell. My parents kept asking me how the new batch was and if i had adjusted. I lied to them just to make them feel better that everything was perfect. Keep in mind my parents are doctors and they have extremely busy schedules and I didn't want to burden them further. Now somehow i have kept myself together with the support of my parents, the only people i talk to are my parents. I somehow made it through the second and third year aswell, now I'm in my final year. This year has been nerve-wracking. All i do is study, eat and sleep. I'm completely alone. All the ridicule i face from my batchmates and juniors has got me all messed up ( for something that wasnt my fault at all). I don't know who i can trust anymore.I have no one in my life besides my family. There is only so much I can take. I'm in another state away from home questioning my sanity. My batchmates are now in internship. They'll graduate soon. Everyday i keep thinking what i had done to deserve this. I keep thinking is it worth it to even live anymore.  Why should i pain myself to become a doctor at all under such pathetic conditions? Why should i have to live with this? If this is how the society is I'd rather be dead."
Scheduled,Non-hiring someone because of his/her family name is considered as cast discrimination ?,"Hi guys !

I was working for a French start-up in Bengaluru recently. One of my responsibility was to be a part of the recruitment team. 

Once, my boss refuses to hire someone because of his  family name/cast.

To tell you everything, he refuses to hire a ""Gowda"" because he wont fit in our team of low-cast villager people profile. 

(lets not discuss about hiring low-profile people from countryside because they are less complaining and more ""flexible"" to be polite)

Is that considered as cast discrimination by the law ?

What is your opinion about that ?

Scheduled,Job Consultancy companies request PAN Card before scheduling interview and then cancel the interview after sending the resume and PAN card. Possible scam?,"So my wife has been trying to attend interviews in the last couple of weeks, I have noticed a trend which kind of raises a red flag. 

The consultancy calls up for a potential opening in some company, they inform that the interview is next day and request to share the resume and PAN Card details. Once these information is sent, she gets a mail from the consultancy saying that this position is put on hold. 

It has happened three times already. It looks like some kind of scam. 

Why do they ask for PAN Card? Is it safe to provide the PAN Card? Can they do anything malicious with the PAN?"

### 1) SARS-­CoV-­2 

* A paper published in a recent issue of the peer­reviewed, open­access journal ‘Emerging Microbes and Infections’ has cautioned that SARS­-CoV-­2, the virus causing the COVID-­19 outbreak, is being shed through multiple routes, so testing through oral swabs alone might not be sufficient
* A paper by Wei Zhang, et al, all from the CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, says investigations on patients in a local hospital infected with the virus revealed the presence of SARS-CoV-­2 in anal swabs and blood as well. What’s more, more anal swabs than oral swabs tested positive at a later stage of infection. Since COVID­19 is believed to be a disease of the respiratory tract, usually only oral swabs are used for diagnosis, and discharge is based on the oral swabs testing negative. The anal positives suggested, they argued, shedding through the oral ­fecal route, and therefore transmission is possible as well. The researchers also showed that a serology test (testing blood for antibodies) can improve detection positive rate, and thus should be used in the future.
* As part of the research, samples ­ including oral swabs, anal swabs and blood were collected by Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital. Two investigations were performed the paper describes ­ In the first investigation, samples were taken from 39 patients, 7 of whom were in a ‘severe condition’. In the second investigation, samples were lifted from 139 patients, whose clinical records were not available.
* When counting all swab positives together, we found most of the positives came from oral swab (8/10, 80%) on day 0. However, this trend appears to change on day 5. We found more (6/8, 75%) anal swab positive than oral swab positive (4/8, 50%)
* The data suggested a shift from more oral positives during the early period to more anal positives during the later period
* The current strategy for the detection of viral RNA in oral swabs used for 2019­nCoV diagnosis is not perfect. The virus may be present in anal swabs or blood of patients when oral swabs detection negative
* This observation implies that a patient cannot be discharged purely based on oral swabs testing negative, and the researchers go on to make a recommendation to do serological tests to confirm the status

#### About Coronaviruses

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.

#### What is COVID-19?

COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.

#### About SARS

The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are related to each other genetically, but they are different. SARS is more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19. There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since 2003.

### 2) G20 Meeting in Saudi Arabia

* Recently, the ministers and central bankers from the world’s largest economies participated in the G20 meeting held in Riyadh (Saudi Arabia).
* It was presided by Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is the first Arab nation to hold the G20 presidency.
* The 2020 G20 Presidency will focus discussions, forums, working groups and Ministerial Meetings under the theme of “Realizing Opportunities of the 21st Century for All”.

#### Key Points

* Global Economy:
   * The global economic growth remains slow and downside risks due to the geopolitical and remaining trade tensions, and policy uncertainty.
   * Though the economic growth is expected to increase in 2020 and 2021 due to loose monetary policy and an easing of trade tensions.
* IMF’ Views at the Meeting:
   * It projects a “V-shaped, rapid recovery” for the global economy, but it warns about the uncertainty around the spread of the coronavirus (COVID 19).
   * The IMF also warned about other risks including rising debt levels in some countries as well as climate change.
* Demand for Global Taxation System:
   * It discussed ways to achieve consensus on a global taxation system for the digital era by the end of 2020.
   * It aims to allow governments to tax digital companies where they do business, rather than where they are registered for tax purposes.
   * India has also demanded closer collaboration between international revenue agencies to investigate the tax affairs of offenders who cross borders for escaping tax investigation.

#### G-20

* About
   * The G20 is an informal group of 19 countries and the European Union, with representatives of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
   * The G20 membership comprises a mix of the world’s largest advanced and emerging economies, representing about two-thirds of the world’s population, 85% of global gross domestic product, 80% of global investment and over 75% of global trade.
* Headquarter
   * The G20 operates as a forum and not as an organization. Therefore, it does not have any permanent secretariat or management and administrative structure.
* Origin
   * 1997-1999 Asian Financial Crisis: This was a ministerial-level forum that emerged after G7 invited both developed and developing economies. The finance ministers and central bank governors began meeting in 1999.
   * Amid the 2008 Financial Crisis, the world saw the need for a new consensus-building at the highest political level. It was decided that the G20 leaders would begin meeting once annually.
* Members
   * The members of the G20 are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the European Union.
   * One nation holds the Chair every year, known as the 'G20 Presidency'. Argentina chaired the G20 summit of 2018 and Japan for 2019.
* V-Shaped Recovery
   * A V-shaped recovery is characterized by a sharp economic decline followed by a quick and sustained recovery.
   * The recession of 1953 is an example of a V-shaped recovery.
   * A V-shaped recovery is different from an L-shaped recovery, in which the economy stays in a slump for a prolonged period.

   * To provide efficient & time-bound citizen-centric service delivery.
   * To develop, install & implement decision support systems in courts.
   * To automate the processes to provide transparency of Information access to its stakeholders.
   * To enhance judicial productivity both qualitatively & quantitatively, to make the justice delivery system affordable, accessible, cost-effective & transparent.
* The e-Courts National portal (ecourts.gov.in) was launched in 2013. This provides Case Status, daily Case-list, Cases Filed and Cases Registered through the Case information System (CIS) Software.
* The National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG) is a part of the e-Courts Integrated Mission Mode Project. It was launched in 2015. The aim is to track judicial performance across different courts in the country.
   * The NJDG is working as a National data warehouse for case data including the orders/judgments for Courts across the country.
   * NJDG works as a monitoring tool to identify, manage & reduce pendency of cases.
   * It also helps to provide timely inputs for making policy decisions to reduce delay and arrears in the system, facilitate better monitoring of court performance and systemic bottlenecks, and, thus, facilitate better resource management.
   * NJDG has specifically helped India improve its ranking in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Report.

### 6) Joint Commands

Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) office is working on a tentative timeline for the establishment of joint commands among the three defense services Army, Navy and Air Force beginning with an Air Defence Command.

#### Joint Commands

* It is a unified command in which the resources of all the services are unified under a single commander looking at a geographical theatre.
* Meaning, a single military commander, as per the requirements, will have the resources of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force to manage a security threat.
* Functions of joint command:
   * The commander of a joint command will have the freedom to train and equip his command.
   * He will have the logistics of all the services at his beckoning.
   * However, the three services will retain their independent identities as well.
* Joint command at present:
   * There are two tri-services commands at the moment.
   * The joint command at the moment, the Andaman and Nicobar Command (ANC), is a theatre command, which is headed by the chiefs of the three services in rotation. It was created in 2001 after a Group of Ministers had given a report on national security following the Kargil War.
   * The Strategic Forces Command was established in 2006 and is a functional tri-services command.
* What is the structure right now?
   * There are 17 commands, divided among the three services.
   * The Army and the Air Force have seven commands each, while the Navy has three commands.
   * These commands report to their respective services and are headed by three-star officers.
   * Though these commands are in the same regions, they are no located together.
* Need for joint commands?
   * The leader of unified command has control over more varied resources, compared to the heads of the commands under the services now. And the officer commanding will have access to the Air Force’s fighter jets and can use them if needed. Through such integration and jointness, the three forces will be able to avoid duplication of resources. The resources available under each service will be available to other services too. The services will get to know one another better, strengthening cohesion in the defense establishment.
* Do the militaries of other countries have such commands?
   * Several major militaries are divided into integrated theatre commands. China’s People’s Liberation Army has five theatre commands: Eastern, Western, Northern, Southern and Central. Its Western Theatre Command is responsible for India. The US Armed Forces have 11 unified commands, of which seven are geographic and four functional commands. Its geographic commands are Africa, Central, European, Indo-Pacific, Northern, Southern, and Space. Cyber, Special Operations, Transportation and Strategic are its functional commands.

* The state government felt the project would enhance connectivity and develop the state’s foothill areas into economic and industrial zones.

#### Issue Area

* Trees may have to be felled and pillars erected from the ground. Petrol, diesel and other materials will be transported, leading to loss of natural habitat.
* This corridor will be a threat to the adjoining Nameri Tiger Reserve in Assam too.

#### What should the Govt. do?

* The Government, while building such a mega project, should consult renowned conservation organizations in the area and also bring all stakeholders who will be impacted by the project on to the negotiating table.

#### Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR)

* It lies in the foothills of the Eastern Himalaya in the East Kameng district of Arunachal Pradesh.
* It falls within the Eastern Himalaya Biodiversity Hotspot.
* Pakke is also the only Hornbill sanctuary in India.

### Tl;dr

IFF has written an open letter to Justice A.P. Shah and shared a copy of it with the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI). In it we have expressed our concerns of self censorship beginning to permeate across online video platforms. We have sent this as a response to three recent developments. First, the Government filed a counter affidavit before the Supreme Court last month in which it endorsed self-regulatory institutional mechanisms for domains like social media. Second, the Minister of Information & Broadcasting Prakash Javadekar met with industry players setting a 100 day timeline for market participants to agree on a code of conduct and adjudicatory mechanism. Third, Hotstar India’s largest online curated content providers banned an episode of Last Week Tonight which dedicated an 18 minute segment to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Therefore, we have written to Justice Shah to take cognizance of these developments and the risk the IAMAI’s self regulation code poses to people’s right to receive and impart information.

### Background

In early February 2020, the Internet and Mobile Association of India launched a new Code for Self Regulation of Online Curated Content Providers. Among other things it sought to establish a second tier oversight mechanism under the aegis of a Digital Content Complaint Council (“DCCC”). The DCCC has been constituted in a manner which is eerily similar to the Broadcast Content Complaints Council (“BCCC”) which is the relevant self-regulatory oversight mechanism for television in India. Notably, the BCCC and the accompanying self-regulation code operates parallel to statutorily recognised content norms for cable television. When such parallel frameworks subsist it is likely that content creation, removal and censorship decisions err on the side of caution. As we all know, India’s TV ecosystem has aligned itself to be a risk averse space where content remains homogeneous and its quality pales in comparison to global creative economies.

We have studied the IAMAI’s self regulation framework and many of the same problems that we see with respect to TV come up in this context as well. It establishes vague prohibited content norms which go beyond constitutional thresholds and provisions under relevant laws like the Information Technology Act, 2000 and the Indian Penal Code, 1860. In addition we are concerned with the way that the framework has been designed in an exclusionary manner, the scope and applicability of the DCCC and its interactions with government in particular, and limited actual considerations of the public’s right to free speech and expression.

We believe it is likely to translate into a paradigm where there will be excessive self censorship which will plague India’s online content space. At a broader level we believe it will lead to an overarching chilling effect which will mean that certain types of content will not get made and it will lead to a body blow for plurality and diversity in India’s fledgling online content ecosystem. Sensing these concerns we have already written to the [**IAMAI** ](https://internetfreedom.in/online-video-streaming-and-tv-are-not-the-same-so-why-is-the-iamai-trying-to-make-it-so/)and the touted chairperson of the proposed DCCC, the former Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court, [**Justice A.P. Shah**](https://internetfreedom.in/a-gentle-open-letter-to-justice-a-p-shah-on-the-online-video-self-regulatory-code/). In it we have articulated our aforementioned concerns with the framework.

Subsequent developments since then reinforce our trepidation with the DCCC and the IAMAI’s self regulation code. To be sure, the Code has only five signatories who have developed the code in conjunction with the IAMAI in an opaque manner-- with no inputs from external stakeholders. The exclusionary nature of the Code is magnified by the fact that the online curated content space in India has more than 35 payers. Therefore, it is concerning that the Indian Government has started taking steps to formalise industry wide adoption and endorse such parallel frameworks which fuel self censorships.

### Latest Developments

In an ongoing matter on online content regulation, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) filed a counter affidavit filed before the Supreme Court of India. In it MIB [**endorsed**](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/self-regulation-model-may-work-for-ott-companies-govt/articleshow/74410087.cms) a self-regulatory institutional mechanism for other domains like social media. This concerns us because it seems like there is a slippery slope brewing which could lead to a chilling effect spreading across major online platforms (both which are fully curated and those which are semi-curated).

Additionally, a [**report**](https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/mumbai/cover-story/curb-your-ott-instincts/articleshow/74449516.cms) in the Mumbai Mirror dated March 03, 2020 revealed that the Union Minister for Information and Broadcasting Mr Prakash Javadekar met with online content industry representatives. In the meeting, the Minister gave the representatives a 100-day timeline by when they must arrive at a consensus on an industry code of conduct and an appropriate adjudicatory mechanism. This is clearly indicative of a risk that the Government may be pushing other segments of the industry to become signatories to the IAMAI Code and come under the jurisdiction of the DCCC. If this happens we could be fast heading to a restrictive online content space along the lines of how it functions in the Indian television ecosystem.

Our concerns self-censorship were of course exacerbated by the recent incident in which Hotstar, one of the primary signatories to the IAMAI’s self regulation code, proactively [**banned**](https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/hotstar-blocks-john-olivers-last-week-tonight-episode-criticising-narendra-modi/article30920096.ece) an episode of Last Week Tonight with John Oliver which was centred on Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

### What have we written?

Given these multiple developments we have written to Justice A.P. Shah outlining these incidents and how it ties up with our stance on the IAMAI self-regulation code. We have urged the concerned parties to revisit their current positions and will follow up with them to consider avenues through which self-regulation does not become a gateway to trample upon people’s freedom of speech and expression, overall creativity, diversity and plurality. To this end, we have shared with both Justice Shah and the IAMAI Governing Council links to a recent report by [**Access Now**](https://www.accessnow.org/guide-how-to-protect-human-rights-in-content-governance/) which looks at different models of online content governance. The report also examines self-regulation and outlines certain key principles in ensuring such systems do not violate human rights.

IFF will continue to continue to engage with the subject, and fight towards ensuring self-regulation does not become a means for collateral censorship.

Politics,"Amidst the continuing assault on privacy within the country, here's one more scam from which you can't escape. (NPR data)","The next round of recording biometric and family­tree details of Indian citizens under the National Population Register (NPR) will be conducted in September 2020, a government notification said. The exercise is different from the decennial Census and is not linked to the National Register of Citizens (NRC).

The objective of the NPR is to create a comprehensive identity database of every usual resident in the country. The database would contain demographic as well as biometric particulars. 

The exercise was conducted earlier in two phases in 2010 and 2015, a senior government official said. For the purpose of the NPR, a usual resident is defined as a person who has resided in a local area for six months or more or a person  
who intends to reside in that area for the next six months or more.

Earlier, the roll out of NPR had slowed down due to overlapping with that of Aadhaar. “In pursuance of subrule(4) of rule 3 of the Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003, the Central government hereby decides to prepare and update the Population Register...... And the field work for house­to­house enumeration throughout the country except Assam for collection of information relating to all persons who are usually residing within the jurisdiction of local registrar shall be undertaken between the 1st day of April 2020 to 30th September 2020,” said a notification issued by Vivek Joshi, Registrar General of Citizen Registration and Census Commissioner.

**It is mandatory for every usual resident of India to register in the NPR.**

[https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/centre-to-ready-npr-for-pan-india-nrc/article28808817.ece](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/centre-to-ready-npr-for-pan-india-nrc/article28808817.ece)

Here's couple of arguments that one may present in favour of such an exercise:

1. It iS a DuTy aS CiTiZeNs of InDiA!!  
Counter: Then why is there an Aadhaar already in place.
2. It WiLL help wEeD oUt thE ILlegaL ImMiGraNts:  
Counter: Are you saying that NRC is a failure?
3. iT wAs Al$0 coNdUCted in 2010, duRinG UPA's RuLe!  
Counter: Bhai tab Aadhaar nahi tha.

Leaving the fun aside, why is this duplication of works being legitimised by the government? Why have an Aadhaar, NRC and NPR all together when any one of the three can perfectly suffice. Even if there are minute differences in the three, why doesn't some ""intelligent"" guy just roll all these up into one?

As far as I'm concerned, Aadhaar and NPR sound the same to me. Just imagine the magnitude of funds involved in any one and then multiply it by 3. That's what it will cost to implement all the three country-wide. This government is really hungry to know all about you- where you go, where do you live, what do you do, whom do you support, who are you in a relationship with...

Talking about redundancy, I'll give you one very specific example. I'm from Gandhinagar, Gujarat. I have witnessed the ""Gujarat Model"" in work. They have a fookin' ""Children's University"" there, which is supposedly ""teaching"" expecting mothers how to deal with pregnancy. I have never seen anyone exit or enter the premises, which sprawls over almost 3 to 4 football fields. THIS, when you have a nation-wide scheme of ASHA workers and Anganwadi doing the same bloody job and even more.

This ""Children's University"" is a classic example of diverting funds into literally defunct areas, making bloody artificial quotations for artificial demands and then hogging that hard-earned public money.

They say the roads of Gujarat are smooth AF don't they? Well no one told you that the same road are rebuilt literally every 6 months with poor materials so they there's a need to remake them again in another 6-8 months. Imagine the amount of money involved in each tender! And these roads are smooth only for the outer regions. The road right in front of my house wasn't rebuilt for almost 5 years and it deteriorated like hell.

TL;DR: Another redundant scheme by the data and money hungry GoRMinT to strip you off your privacy as well as hard earned money to achieve exactly zilch."

Yes! All of that and yet, more importantly because she was a veteran politician: one who fought till her last breath.

Often in democracies, we overlook the importance of an able administrator - those who keep the wheels of motion turning thereby enabling the rest of people to fulfill their potential. Sheila Dixit was that; and more.

One may differ with her policies and implementations; one cannot but marvel at her tenacity. That rarest of rare quality which sometimes makes all the difference, especially when found in a politician.

Sheila Dixit was an extraordinary lady. With her sad demise, the nation has lost one of its most exemplary daughters.

Politics,Abrogation of Article 370 and 35A. Why now ? What was the urgency ?,"Players involved:

&gt;RAW, ISI , Pakistan Government(PG), Govt of India(GoI) , US Govt, Taliban

Some facts first :

* Trump is in deep waters if he loses 2020 elections, may even go to jail. He wants a win badly, to sell to his vote base . His focus :
   * Trade deal with China.They are not budging
   * Nuclear Deal with North Korea, thats why his chummy messages for Kim-jong-un. They are not budging either. Just recently they conducted missile tests.
   * Iran. Not happening fast enough. All other against pulling out of the deal.
   * Mexico : Wall not happening.
   * Afghanistan. He wants to pull out all his troops from there.
* Out of all these, Afghanistan one seems most doable, since it only requires a deal with Taliban. A non-govt entity, which cant wait it out to end Trump's tenure.

So how come India and Kashmir gets into this particular picture ?

Trump wants to pull out  from Afghanistan since they have realized that they are fighting a losing war in Afghanistan, against Taliban, like Vietnam war(many parallels here : Nixon--&gt;Trump ; Kissinger--&gt; Zalmay Khalizad ; VietCong --&gt; Taliban). Now to get Taliban to talks, they need someone with sway over them, so enters Pakistan. If Pakistan /ISI is able to break a deal between Taliban and US, they would get into good books of Trump, hence renewal of Aid, removal of sanctions (FATF).

5 July, RAW Chief briefs PMO that US and Taliban could reach an agreement by 1st September. So if we want to get full control of Kashmir, the time is now. Because Trump may choose to reward Pakistan by meddling in this front. He already knows the situation (Courtsy Balakot, and Abhinandan's release negotiations. US govt was involved, Trump announced the 'good news' before Pakistan).

Direct quote from HT times article :

*.... following which Washington could choose to reward Islamabad for its role with the resumption of military and economic aid. That could lead to an intensification of Islamabad’s direct and indirect sponsorship of terror groups operating in Kashmir. If India had to make the move on J&amp;K’s special status that was on the government’s agenda, there wasn’t a lot of time to lose.*

22-23 July : Biggest blunder by Trump . Imran Khan was visiting US. And Trump said Modi has personally asked him to mediate on Kashmir, a claim refuted first by US state officials themselves. then by Indian officials. This was the final nail in the coffinn by thr US, clearly indicating a deal between US govt and Pak Govt could actually happen on Kashmir. Time to take action was now, or this could get really ugly in coming years (internationally)

So, what happened next ?

India sent Satellite phones and Heron drones in Kashmir.

Increased number of troops.

Closed Amarnath Yatra.

GOT FULL CONTROL OF KASHMIR, IN FORM OF UNION TERRITORY.

We can discuss all the legal, moral aspects of the manoeuvres done to achieve that (Curfew,house arrests, comm blackout etc.), but for GOI, it was now or never. And they choose now.

In words of Benito Mussolini –

“Democracy is a kingless regime infested by many kings who are sometimes more exclusive, tyrannical and destructive than one, if he be a tyrant. It is the fear of being exposed by the media before the public that most of the politicians keep themselves under control to some extent""

If media is honest and committed in its job, democracy is bound to function more efficiently and the loopholes present in any democratic system can certainly be plugged to the fullest satisfaction of the people. On the contrary, if media is biased, corrupt and favours only a particular party or few individuals, it can prove to be very dangerous for the smooth functioning of democracy.

For this very reason I believe people like Arnab Goswami  
 and Navika Kumar are a disgrace to Journalism and Democracy. People like them should be treated as Anti Nationals of this Country."

Also the his relationship with rss leaders were good apparently. Recently too there were articles that he didn't want the shit storm Kashmir would bring and wanted Hyderabad over Kashmir.

I understand people can be wrong at times but if BJP is using his face is there any political philosophy that sardar had that resonates with BJPs goals.

Edit: the question is because of mixed signals by all the groups some praise SVP some call him a communalist I'm not declaring him a bigot here I just feel that bigots look upto bigots or are just using his name."

But not much to my surprise, voters of Delhi gave this huge mandate against the decisive policies and stood up with a progressive approach.

Now as the analysis were going on, experts on TV pointed out some really interesting traits of Kejriwal's Election campaign, which were basically some core reasons behind this victory:

>Not getting into communal vs secular scenario

>Made arguments on work profile.

>Assumed a soft hindutva position. Rejected an Idea that is Hindutva but not a belief that is Hinduism.

>Redefined 'Nationalism'. Rejected Bhajapa's version of the same thing.

>Avoided any direct, serious 'Dig' at NaMo

>Avoided Shaheen bagh

There maybe more than these. 

My question here is, are we seeing a new template here, one that other aspiring states can follow as well?"

Politics,An interesting take on Indian elections by Shekhar Gupta at Centre for Policy Research on 'How India Voted',"This is going to be a long read but one of the best post-election analysis that I've seen. I have transcribed, paraphrased, and highlighted what Gupta said [here](https://youtu.be/mL5quXQzLkY?t=4925).

Today Congress and the rest can complain about resources but in 2014 Congress was in power and Modi was an outsider and yet he won. To analyse this, we need to forget our voting preferences and admit that Modi’s rise is not a fraud on India. Modi’s is a phenomenon and has had a better story and a better product to sell for almost a decade. 

Since it suited everybody around Congress, they said BJP lost 2004 due to 'India Shining'. Cut down those number : **BJP just got 9 seats less than Congress. BJP lost due to Gujarat 2002 where BJP's previous allies (Mamata, CBN) were no longer willing to ally with them since BJP refused to fire Modi**

**Another myth was spread after 2009 when the incumbent came back with a larger majority than the previous one. Who do you then give credit to? If you credit it to MMS, it’s an outrage in the Congress party.** So you have to find an excuse and credit it to Mrs.Gandhi and whatever she had done. So you say loan waivers and MNREGA. 

In urban areas, where least poor 30% people live Congress party’s strike rate in 2009 was 68%. In the areas where 70% of Indias poorest live, Congress party’s strike rate was 30 something percent. This data was available, and the party was not willing to see the reasons that **India had seen 7 years of breathless growth and because the intellectual establishment and political darbaar of the Congress party was not willing to accept that, they undermined UPA2**,and pushed it back - people got so angry who got used to growth people brought in Modi from Gujarat because he’ll bring you something. 

**In this election campaign, the most striking thing was Modi getting away with saying that nothing happened in this country before 2014** - that history of this country begins in 2014. That is not true. **The previous 10 years had a lot of growth, built a lot of infrastructure - many things happened**. Look at the way global economic downturn was handled by India, it was a great economic success story. Look at how Satyam was handled. But the amazing thing was, in so many days of campaigning I never heard anyone from the Congress party say anything about what their govt did under UPA2. 

**This is the autoimmune disease of the Congress party. This Congress party wants to blame Modi, media - they’re watching the wrong channels. That fact is the only achievements the Congress party was willing to talk about was not even of Rajiv Gandhi but of Indira Gandhi when 80% of the voters are born after Indira Gandhi had passed away.** So don’t blame others. Look inside - the voter is transactional. The transaction for the voters is NREGA money, the gas cylinder, or it can also be the pride/security of the country and how good is the leader. 


**This idea of keeping India secular has been outsourced to it’s 15% muslims. The muslims are fed up because nobody does anything for them but you keep dragging them everywhere as if it’s their responsibility.** *You have to save secularism, I have the Yadavs with me, so and so will bring the Dalits.* Dalits are not with her anymore. She has has 10 seats, Akhilesh has 5 seats. That tells you that Mayawati is finished because Akhilesh has been able to transfer his Muslim votes to her, but she hasn’t been able to transfer her Dalit votes to him. The Dalit votes are now changing.

This time as I drove around the country I would just get ordinary people and ask who are you voting for and why and record it. I have 60 of these recordings. All 60 are voting for Modi. From north KA, south KA, Bengal, UP, Bihar, MP, Rajasthan, Haryana. You can blame media, money, whatever but **if in Haryana if BJP can get 68% vote, and Haryana’s premier Jatt party INLD only gets 1.8% that tells you, that you are looking at something new.** Somebody just had a much better product. So respect the verdict, but for that first you have to first accept that there was a much better product on offer. 

People have been defeated despite money. Look at CBN, he wasn’t short of money in Andhra. **You can have a great organisation but you need to have workers who have the commitment.** Look at what YS Reddy has built in AP. It’s an organisation that can fight BJP anyway. Look at Mamata in WB - if it weren’t for BJP would have gotten 35 seats. 

**The voter in this country does not trust Congress schemes. Anything that happened in the past, very little got to the voter. This time LPG, the house, and toilets. I was looking for evidence to the contrary but we were not finding it. We were finding gas cylinders - we would even peek inside the houses and found gas cylinders. You build a house govt gave you 1.5 lac, you build a toilet and govt gave you 15k. The govt didn’t build anything for you - they used Direct Benefit Transfer. The used the JAM trinity. Jandhan - Aadhar - Mudra loans. Initially I thought Mudra loans were all rubbish and they were all fake. But I have videos of a Dalit saying that I got 50K mudra loans to build a chai shop and I pay 1300 per month back and if I don’t the branch manager comes. Check the data - 4.81 cr have gotten Mudra loans and 2.1 cr loans has been dispensed.**

**I have to say, we journalists and commentariat chose not to see it. Even when we see it, we compulsively tried to deny it. *“Oh they’ve got gas cylinders - but they cant afford the next one”.* But the fact is they got one. *“Oh the next one is full price”* - that is a lie - the next one is not full price. Next one you pay the full price and you get your subsidy back in the Jandhan bank account. But once you have the connection - you’re empowered. Once you have the toilet, *“Oh but water is not there”* - but the water will come. The fact is these people had never seen delivery of anything. And even if they got anything they did not see anything they could get without having to bribe including in most cases the NREGA wages.** So this is a big change. This is a big governance exercise - you may like it or not like it. But smart people will learn from it. KCR did, Babu did it and now Jagan will do it. Non-smart people will complain about. 

It’s wrong to say this is only Hindutva. Hindutva has helped Modi consolidate upper caste. I have never seen any caste vote bank so cohesive. Because they also see him as this guy having protected “merit” . Ensure that these other “faltus” don’t walk into this territory. He has taken away all the other OBC’s simply because caste based parties became family run parties. Because SP &amp; RJD family run Yadav parties - Yadav stayed there, other OBC’s fled. Similarly for Dalits - jatavs became powerful, the rest have fled. 

In a lot of rallies, Rahul spoke out “Chowkidar char hai” - a lot of people spoke out went back saying “Ye angrez Aadmi hai, jo apna desi Aadmi hai aur khudse banke aaya hai use chor bol rahe hai” . There was this video going around where Priyanka was talking about Rahul being black belt, diving,pilot etc. This was being circulated by the other side! The ordinary people were saying they also wanted to dive, become a pilot. So they started asking what does Rahul do that he has so much money. This India hates elitism. Modi is now elite - he dresses well, he’s got style. People say he has earned it unlike you guys who came because your daddy gave it to you."

But this rant is not just about this situation, it is about people's ignorance and lack of knowledge, people don't understand what is propoganda, and they don't know there history either and they continue to pit up a communuty against a political party. No BJP does not represent Hindus all it represents are the hindu extremists, so when i say fuck bjp, it means, fuck the politicians who are making this country burn. Bjp is the only party who has reached new heights and depths of instigating people to turn on each other, and paint muslims as someone who are gonna attack hindus for no reason. Regardless of what people want, a political party's job is to maintain communal harmony in a democratic country. What part of this people don't undertstand ? and why are dalits even supporting BJP's assholes, they beat up dalits, discriminate against them, all bjp is trying to do is keep brahmin supremacy in this country. Everyone is crazy about religion, i say fuck religion, if you believe in a higher power that is cool i don't care but killing in the name of god, fuck no.

Had to get this off my chest, sorry, and thanks for reading if you made it to the end.

If you have any objections to what i have said, i can conversate or debate sanely but please stop the craziness, use your brains i don't care what your parents, uncle aunties believe in, use your own brains otherwise India is not gonna stay a democratic country, and this is not even a baseless fact anymore, it's all around us, we just close our eyes to look around."

Almost every single chutiya politician in our country has tons of hateful tweets (calling people various names, telling people they're jihadi etc) that are easily visible on Twitter. If you have time, please go through the twitter profile of accounts that you might think are spreading hate and report all the tweets. If we all do it, we might be able to get some of these accounts off the platform. 

Start with reporting the ones with lesser followers so Twitter is more likely to take action. We can make a difference if we all act together."

Politics,"To everyone so loudly celebrating today, ask yourselves a few basic questions.","1. What strange idea of a unified nation are you celebrating when the decisions (some of which are yet to be formalized into effect) to alter an entire state's present and future were taken without its citizens' consent or even knowledge, amid a total blackout of communication services and lockdown on personal movement, so that the state's own people had no idea (and many might still not) what was going on until after the rest of the world? If this ever happens to you, I'd like to know how celebratory you feel.

2. What bold move are you celebrating when the only way this could have been done was in total secrecy and by silencing any voice of dissent from the state, by placing leaders under arbitrary house arrest? What courage does it take to silence and subjugate everyone and then make your move unimpeded?   

3. What historic step are you celebrating – the one that has set such a dangerous precedent for Constitutional principles and democracy, the one that has trampled all over human rights?

4. What is this #KashmirHamaraHai that you are shouting about? Is Kashmir just a piece of land to you, one to be annexed and forced into submission by trickery and without the consent or knowledge of the people who actually live on that land? Are you honestly just so excited about buying that retirement home in Sonamarg or Pahalgam that you've forgotten basic humanity?

5. What development opportunities are you so looking forward to – the arbitrary use of UAPA to arrest any protestor on charges of terrorism?

6. What firm message against terrorism are you celebrating - do you not see that this is smoke and mirrors to distract from the fact that the economy is doing so poorly?

7. Even if you genuinely believe that 370 and 35A need to go and that bifurcation is somehow going to be useful, is there any need to be so ridiculously insensitive to the absolute fear and panic within which all of this is unfolding, the fact that people have been unable to speak with their parents, unable to find out if they are even alive? You might argue the end justifies the means – that is, if you're even thinking about the means at all. But the next time something like this happens – and make no mistake, there will be a next time, and it won't always be in far-flung Assam or Kashmir that don't directly affect you or your family – think about how you reacted today.

Edit: This is a post from Facebook. I am not the one who wrote this. I shared it here because I found it raised some important questions, and we should put ourselves into their skin before taking sides. Or if there are indeed times when you can't take a side, then this is probably one of those for me. Also, I don't doubt the intent of the government, but I can not support the undemocratic way in which this whole thing was carried out."

For right wing supporters like my dad, the reason for this chaos is 'liberal Islamists', illegal Muslims trying to take over India, etc. (you know, the usual right wing rants) and for the left wing supporters, the reason for this chaos are the WhatsApp University passed bhakts who are pro-fascism. But whatever the reason is, one thing remains - that our country's conditions aren't good at all.

If you look  from a foreigners' perspective, India is now a hellhole. Its economy is in shambles, riots are breaking out all over India over the controversial acts of BJP like NRC, CAB, University fee hikes, etc., rape reports are rising with the recent brutal Telangana rape case, Kashmir has been in dark for 4 months now, internet shutdown has now become the norm of BJP and if your area is facing internet shutdown, its just another day in India. Not to mention things like pollution, water running out, environmental and climate crisis, etc.

Its very hard to maintain peace and sanity in minds of people in this pathetic condition of this country. No wonder Twitter and other social media are such a toxic place nowadays. Nobody is at peace, at least in this country, everybody is paranoid, frustrated and angry at each other. Sometimes I just wonder what our country initially aspired to become - a developed nation with money, technology, freedom and peace. And look at what it has become."

Politics,Some things I need to get off my chest about India's sexism,"Hello, I'm Indian on my dad's side but I don't live in India (I won't tell my location for privacy reasons). I have been there a couple times but never lived there so my opinion might not count. I won't pretend that I know fully what it's like to be a women in India but I know the pressure that my community puts on me even if we don't live there.

What I wanted to tell is something that has been weighing on my heart for a long time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Watching the news, hearing the stories my dad tells me about his female friends, walking around in the Indian neighborhood of my city... all of that hurt me very very deeply.  I'm not saying that all Indian men are like that, no, not at all. I'm saying that the eduction provided by society, the parents, schools, and the internet has led me to a conclusion that might not please everyone. 

&amp;#x200B;

Most Indian men I meet (not all!) have very predatory behaviour. I live in a city where I see more immigrants from all over the world than locals, but I almost only experience that kind of arrassment around them. Some have said very vile things in front of older shop owners who wouldn't defend me, but rather look down upon me because I went out there without my dad. To them that's the reason why I deserve to be treated like that. The only times I've been followed on the street and on the trains were with Indian men. I seriously don't want to come to this conclusion, but it's the truth.

They have no respect for women, they think you're just a piece of meat waiting to be bought, touched. Women are considered a source of income with the dowry. Did you know that the dowry must go to the wife after a marriage? And did you know that traditionally, the women is supposed to control the money in a marriage? Or did you know that it's stritcly forbidden in Hinduisim to ask for more dowry? (source: my dad, a brahman) 

And look where we are now... Women getting attacked with acid, raped, shaved, tortured, because the husband, or his family, is greedy. Greed will be the downfall of India, of civilization.

&amp;#x200B;

I love India with all my heart. It's my country, my nation, my people. I feel so confortable thinking of India, my family over there, but this has to stop. Women need to take actions, fast. I get so angry when I read the news, I cry just thinking about the state of the nation. A woman gave you your life, she carried you, cared for you and you dare treat another woman this way? 

&amp;#x200B;

What bothers me the most is that Indian men (the okay ones) leave that problem to the women, they don't wanna get involved. They don't help their Indian sisters, won't defend them, they stay silent... Silence is also a form of assault. Please, if you're a men witnessing a form of assault, help your Indian sisters.

So yes of course women need to take actions, be as violent as the men if need be. We have been told to hold back our anger to please. Please who? The elders who contribute to rape culture? The future husband who might not like your words of protest because he feels attacked ? Frick that. Fight back. They wanna be violent, so be it. 

Women: create groups, go after those who have hurt you but never payed the price of justice. Try to be as legal as possible, but if the law doesn't do justice, make your own justice. Remember that sometime ago, slavery was still legal. The justice system tolerated it, but it was immoral. If the system tolerated assault against women, fight back. That's the only way."

I replied in the group with a funny Arnab gif and everyone dismissed it.

If you ask me, by believing in messages like these instead of our Medical and Security personnel, who are putting their bodies on the line to fight COVID-19 for us, is utterly disrespectful and stupid.

However, with the absolute BULLSHIT that the government is doing in Kashmir, I am terribly disappointed and I truly believe this is the worst thing India has ever done. But do you know what's even worse? Our fellow Indians are being BLINDLY nationalistic as always, ready to support the government from phantom threats. There should be protests happening in all the big cities, for what the Indian government is doing right now is an atrocity. People are getting shot on the street with anti-protesting shotguns. I guarantee that if this was happening in some other country, all of us would be quick to jump on the criticism bandwagon and compare them to North Korea. But I will tell you without any doubt that the actions India is taking against Kashmir is unwarranted and is comparable to the likes of North Korea of China, who you all so dearly detest. Say whatever you want, that I'm a snobby NRI who lives comfortable life in the U.S, or that I don't know any struggles in life. Who TF cares??? This isn't about me. This is about the greater good of our beautiful country. Why is everyone silent? This is absolutely unacceptable! 

NEVER HAVE I EVER BEEN SO ASHAMED TO BE INDIAN. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR : What India is doing in Kashmir is horrible, to the likes of what China and North Korea would so, so why in the world are is the population not saying anything?"

We have all been moaning about this problem since decades but nobody has done anything about it. Congress is criticizing this move now but why didn't they do anything in the ten long years they had?

From Pakistan's perspective, I don't see why are they making so much noise about Kashmir? Why can't they apply the Punjab model here too - just as Punjab is divided into Pakistani and Indian Punjab, why can't the same be applied to Kashmir too? Its a peaceful and least resistance path in the present circumstances.

Asking the citizens (plebiscite) is a wrong idea according to me because this will send a very wrong message to the integrity of our nation. Any state tomorrow will come with the idea of becoming a separate country in the name of plebiscite. Even strategically, J&amp;K becoming a country is out of question as it will be surrounded by super powers on all the sides.

For those disagreeing with the methods, how do you think article-370 would have been removed in any other manner considering the high resistance to it from separatists and militants in that state?"

The crisis is grave because several of those who resigned are senior leaders, ideologues not just opportunists.

None of these have joined BJP and have explicitly mentioned that their decision was not related to BJP.

The background context is that last election had no clear mandate. BJP won the largest number of seats but not enough to form a government. JDS and Congress formed a post-poll coalition and formed the government. But they were so incompatible that they could not even fight the LS elections united. Result BJP won landslide in LS polls.

Anyways this is a shocking development and points seriously to the extent of dysfunction in both Congress and JDS and their associates.

Veterans like Ramalinga Reddy (Congress) and Vishwanath (JDS) walking out is earth shattering in these parts of the world.

Is there anything I can do?
 She works in railways and hasn't been officially asked to go to work.
Anywhere I can complaint about this, or any suggestion would be helpful!!

EDIT: Thanks for the overwhelming support guys!! I've told mom to try many of the things you guys suggested, she'll ask her to give an official letter first and incase she still forces her to go unofficially, then I told her to use, u/marrmalayde 's idea, she agreed!!

Politics,[Useless thought] Does anybody else feels like BJP is trying to orchestrate a foreign country's / entity's control over India?,"their actions are remarkably simmilar to administrations that have done this before all over the world .



 First they win over the population by winning over the majority then declare the minority is conspiring day and night to finish 'us' I.e. the majority,  



be extremely vocal against foreign influence no matter good or bad when they are not in power. e.g.  FDI bill of UPA time allowing for 75% of FDI in retail . BJP going crazy over secular govts attack on their baniya brothers. This is an actual quote by gadkari . Sushma swaraj announcing she'll shave her head out side parliament if such draconian laws are passed.



Then when they come to power they passed 100% FDI bill shamelessly within months  .




There are numerous examples like this like the India US nuclear deal etc. If you look closely it becomes so clear that BJP has tried to weaken Indias standing in the world setting as a self relient powerhouse and but on other hand  increasing the market value of Indias, their end game seems like to make a consumption giant in today's global economy , a mere  market for foreign players to sell their good in , kind of like a watered down version of British raj 




But Indians,  myself included were made to think opposite,  Thanks to BJPs marketing game . They made us believe that BJP is taking all the right actions , bringing India back to her glory days . Now I realised the newly found respect from Goras and chinis is because we are making our markets easier for then . Indians hate that ,All this was impossible if BJP didn't have their Propoganda power . 


In Points the step they are taking :


1&gt; made party funding totally opaque,  now they can receive huge funding from anywhere ,no question asked 

2&gt; control large no of media outlets , made all of their voter base to watch it religiously.  Think for a moment,  can a self respecting,  successful , unbiased person watch channels like zee , India TV?

3&gt; after winning majority vote they merged their organization with the idea of nation . Now you cannot criticize BJP without being accused of anti nationalism. 
BJP = Bharat 



4&gt; slowly taking away human aspect of enemy group from their target audiences conscience.

But what they don't get is this hatred will shift toward their own after, if always does, after they're done with muslims most probably baniya, jains, gujjars  or other well off communities will be the target. 



5&gt;eliminated competition,  a viable option for people to turn to when they realise it's time for a new govt .

6&gt; Shifting of point of comparison,  I Remember people used to be unhappy during Manmohan days that India is performing not so good w.r.t China, singapore and USA in key sectors . Nowadays people are happy that we're out performing Pakistan in almost all sectors.



7&gt;instilled  fear of extinction in target audiences  ,constant violence,  riots and rape involving communal angle to keep the narrative us vs them rather than have people focus on real issues concerning the nation. 




&gt; this is not a point for the argument but another observation,  Hindutva imo was never possible to grow into this level of degeneracy if it wasn't for radical Muslim leaders having a free hand for so long. And no small percent of every community argument is not valid here. 



Last generation of middle class and rich muslims is directly responsible for this , they never spoke against I'll commented by their members,  I doubt know how but even the most emphatic muslims I know can just turn their head the other way if the culprit involved is Muslim and victim is not. 



Who is most vocal about hindutva ? Other Hindus


Who stoped separatist movement when they turned violent in Punjab? Sikhs



Who was most vocal against church abuse ?  Christians .



Unless we acknowledge this fact BJP will keep riding on the us vs them sentiment no matter how much we abuse Modi or Shah. 




This is just random thoughts about BJP,  hate politics etc share your thoughts."

I feel the exact same thing happened before elections too, when everyone started asking the real questions about employment, farmer distress, Balakot strikes happened and forgot about the real issues. Ofc Kashmir is an important issue but media should do a better role of covering the other issues too even if it is for 5-10 mins of time.

Indian politics is now in a new phase where your 'Party face' matters more than your party or your ideology","As the final results trickle in, exit polls have been proven true that a quarter of bjp and Congress voters have switched to 'kejriwal' in Delhi elections. AAP knew that Kejriwal's popular image is their biggest strength and they used it perfectly. From a campaign centered around kejriwal (""lage raho kejriwal"") to posing this question to Delhi voters :**""kejriwal vs who""**.

Gone are the days when a party enjoys blind loyalty just because of past history. As the opposition recovers from 2019 drubbing at hands of modi, it seems that they have realised that any election campaign now requires a strong and popular leader to anchor their campaign.

All the elections in which bjp have been defeated in past few years have one thing in common, the opposition had a strong regional leader

* rajasthan : sachin pilot

* karnataka : siddaramiah (Congress got more votes than bjp)

* Odisha : naveen patnaik

* punjab : captain Amarinder Singh

* maharashtra : sharad pawar (Congress pretty much gave up in maharashtra and didn't even bother campaigning while sharad pawar was doing rallies even in heavy rains)

* Jharkhand : Hemant soren

* telangana : KCR

* Tamil nadu : stalin

* Andra pradesh : Jagan


Indian voters are smart. Political pandits think that the average voter is an idiot who can't distinguish between state and national elections.

In not even a single state election has bjp managed to even come close to their national vote share. People know that modi won't be resigning as PM and coming to their state. Moreover, state elections are fought on different issues and environment than national elections. This was clear in Delhi where while bjp was going on a rampage about shaheen bagh, 50% of the voters didn't even know about it, while the rest didn't understand or care ahout it.

 It has almost no government land holding but land is pooled from farmers and given developed plots. 85% of the land is in hands of  Chandra babus community .  Proponents say we will have our own Hyderabad and Bengaluru in 15 - 20 years and the city will be the economic lifeline .

Second model -  [Siva ramakrishnan committee](https://m.jagranjosh.com/current-affairs/sivaramakrishnan-committee-submitted-report-to-union-home-ministry-on-ap-capital-1409293406-1).  

Basically a decentralized form of government by using technology ,where one area shall not be developed exclusively  .  It envisages setting up regional  zones  that should be developed  equally  depending on the locations strengths  and weaknesses .   

Proponents say development without equality is meaningless and will create regional hatred  and further divisions .

Politics,The confession of a pseudosecular,"October 31st, 1984. We heard about it from the senior students that Indira Gandhi was assassinated by her guards. The teacher told us after a couple of periods that we all had to go home. We were happy that we would not have to attend any more classes. Then he gave the reason. As he said that the Prime Minister of India was no more, most of the students pointed towards the only Sikh boy in the class and said, ""*Sir Sir, iske logon ne mara hai*"" (Sir Sir, this guy's people killed her). The thin little Sikh boy shrank in trepidation. All his friends were accusing him. We were children. We were really small children then, hardly 12 or 13 years old but we knew who belonged to which community, who was a Sikh and who was not. We knew who was a Hindu and who was a Muslim. I still remember what followed Indira Gandhi's assassination. It was bad but it was said that it was the punishment for killing Indira Gandhi and so it was okay. If it was okay for the elders, it was okay with me. 

Fast forward to 1988 -

""Can anyone tell me what is the national religion of our country?"", asked Mrs Gulati.

""Hinduism, Madam"", replied the class, almost in unison. I also said the same after scratching my head.

The withdrawn guy sitting in the last bench perhaps did not say anything and so Mrs. Gulati asked, ""Khurshid, what is the national religion of India?""

Hesitantly, Khurshid stood up, blinked his bespectacled eyes and said, ""Madam, Hinduism?""

""India is a secular country. There is no national or official religion"", said Mrs Gulati.

Class X Section A fell silent. We had no idea what was secular. It was a new word in our very limited English vocabulary. After the class ended, there was a buzz in the air. Who is secular? What is secular? When did India become secular? Are Hindus also secular? Now, when I look back to the days of 1988, I wonder why even the Christian, Sikh and Muslim students had no problem saying that the national religion of India was Hinduism. But the reasons were in front of my eyes. I just overlooked them. It did not occur to me that we chanted a Sanskrit sloka every day in the assembly. We celebrated Saraswati Puja in the school.  We were taught Ramayana and Mahabharata in the class. We studied Sanskrit instead of Urdu which was more widely spoken in India or any regional language which was more useful. Mrs Gulati's assertion that India was a secular country was just a flash in the pan. We heard the term, found it to be quite confusing and quickly forgot it. 

My personal understanding was that India was a Hindu country no matter if people wanted to call it secular. Secular was a fancy word educated people used. India was a Hindu country where others also lived. They were also Indians but they were the other Indians much like the platypus that was also a mammal but not exactly. The novel idea of secularism did not sink into my psyche for most of my age. The stereotypes did not let it happen. The Christian was either a priest with a big cross hanging from his neck or an alcoholic rolling on the beaches of Goa. The Sikh was the virtuous but not so smart alcohol-glugging, Bhangra-dancing semi-Hindu who said ""*Chak de phatte*"" with or without a reason. The Muslim was either the terrorist or the smuggler with a beard and a skull cap, who ate beef. No matter how many Sikhs, Christians and Muslims I came across in my younger days, the stereotype reigned supreme. It did not occur to me that there were more smugglers in India who were not Muslim. It did not dawn upon me that my father did not have to be a Sikh to be an alcoholic. It did not occur to me that LTTE fighters did not need to be Muslims to pioneer suicide bombing. 

My mother wore a new saree to go to the *mandap*. The loudspeakers blared vulgar Bollywood songs while children played and women queued up to pay homage to Devi Durga. My head throbbed with migraine. But I was not unhappy. Durga Puja comes once in a year. What is the harm if people have some fun. But I did not tell myself what was the harm if the loud *azaan* from the nearby mosque wake me up. ""These bloody Muslims! Can't they do their prayers without the loudspeakers? Secularism does not mean you wake up people before the dawn every day."". It is not like Durga Puja that noise pollution increases only for four days. I did not think that it was not just for four days that noise pollution increased. Kali Puja, Diwali, Laxmi Puja, Jaddhatri Puja, Dol (Holi), Janmasthami, Saraswati Puja, Shani Puja, Shiva Ratri, Vishwakarma Puja and every conceivable Puja resonated at the same decibel level and gave me a migraine. But India is a secular country and so people have the right to celebrate their festivals. My definition of secularism was a polymorphic virus. It changed its attributes and purpose. When the Babri mosque was demolished, I did not feel any pain or remorse. On the contrary, I sort of justified it to me by thinking that Babar was indeed a tyrant. It did not matter to me why Babar's being a tyrant should justify the demolition of a mosque more than 400 years after his death. I did not think about how I could not morally oppose the despicable act of thousands of hooligans and vandals. 

But as the years passed by, I became less and less of a typical uninformed and unaware Indian. I understood that secularism was not what was told to us. Secularism was not refraining from hurting others' religious sentiments. Secularism was the principle of separation between the state and the religious bodies. India was not a secular country. The state relentlessly and systematically pushed and propagated the religious sentiments of one community and it was my community. It took years but I realized that I was not secular. It takes time to change the stance. Sometimes it takes an event or an incident to change the stance.

""Go back to India. People will kill you here"", said the Chacha in Bengali. 

""Why? What happened?"", I asked.

""Hindus are killing Muslims in your country"", said Chacha, adding, ""Don't tell me later that I did not warn you. Go away tonight."".

My flight from Dhaka to Calcutta was still a week away. But I managed to get tickets and left Bangladesh that very evening without visiting my grandfather's ancestral village. It was the second night of the Gujarat pogrom. On the short flight, I cursed the Hindus of Gujarat for not letting me visit my ancestral village, the sudden fear of death I had to face, for running away like a fugitive for no crime of mine. For the first time, I felt a repugnance towards ""my people"". My people? How could those *Trishul* brandishing, *Jai Sri Ram* chanting vermins on a rampage be my people? What was common between me and those vectors of the disease of communal hatred? Wasn't that Chacha who warned me of the impending trouble ""my people"" instead? Yes, he was my people even though his nationality was different and his religion was different. A person cannot be my people just because his religion or his caste or his nationality are the same as mine.

By the time 2014 general election came, I was a proud secular. I hated the system that kept the Muslims backward by giving them a few subsidies and recognizing only the Mullahs as the representative of the community as much as I hated the burgeoning majoritarianism of the Hindus. Secularism had to be redefined. It can no longer be sucking up to the fundamentalist elements of society. It can no longer be catering to the whims of the religious filth of the country. But it was already too late. Indians were giving up all pretensions of being secular. The term ""secular"" was becoming a cussword. 

Today when I see the hooligans in Kanwar-yatra being showered with rose petals from helicopters by police officers, when I see food-fascism by banning beef, when I see Muslims being lynched for mere suspicion of possessing beef, when I see Muslims thrashed to death for no reasons, when I see lynchers being garlanded by Harvard educated ministers, when I see the dead body of an alleged lyncher draped in tri-colour, I feel that this country needs to be truly secular. That is the only way this country can survive. 

It was our collective negligence and deliberate misinterpretation of the word ""secularism"" that today the word has become dirty and we are a proto-religious regressive fascist country, instead of a secular socialist progressive democracy.  Our children, the future generation will curse us, spit on us for what we have done to our motherland. It is now our duty to bring this nation back from the brinks of ruination."

Literally whole day's effort got wasted because Modi living in his sab changa sii bubble still doesn't understand the common man of the country. He could have avoided the drama but that wouldn't fulfill his massive ego. 

His silly chest-thumping message put lakhs of people directly at risk of being exposed to the virus.

Photography,[SERIOUS] How would people in India react if someone started posting erotic/implied nude photography on Instagram?,"PS: I’m going to be as specific as possible so people here can actually tell how others, specially my friends, college teachers etc might react. I’ve also added serious tag so that the replies don’t turn into sarcastic/joke types. 

I’m an Indian guy in my mid twenties working abroad. I like to do photography as a hobby in my free time although art of any form but mainly paintings and movies have always been something I’ve been very interested in. Lately I started shooting female portraits which involves mostly European and sometimes Asian women. I post all my work on Instagram where my friends and even teachers from school follow me.

So far my friends and colleagues etc have been really appreciating my photos. Some of them were very impressed since I do feel my photos are good and stand out. Surprisingly I’ve received better feedback from my female friends.

Now I’m thinking of starting erotic/boudoir photography which involves women in very less clothing. Some of that also involves nude women where nudity is implied i.e. breasts hidden by hand etc (no frontal nudity). Something along the lines of playboy shoots. I have couple of shoots already planned with two  European girls.

I’m not someone who cares much about what others think but I’m a bit concerned if this is going to have a bad impact on me in any way that I am unaware of. I mean any way this can have a bad effect. In terms of reputation or how people may react or perceive me etc. I’m especially not sure how Indian people would react to this and if I’m going to be viewed in a negative way. Thanks for reading."

Hi Reddit India, thanks a lot for inviting me for this AMA! A brief intro about myself: Thithi is my debut fiction feature film as director, and is currently playing in theatres across India. I am also the author of an English novel called ""It's Raining in Maya"". Before making Thithi I made twelve short films, and grew up writing poetry and pursuing photography. I am thrilled to be here with my filmmaking soul-mate in many ways; the DoP for THITHI, the amazingly multi-talented filmmaker from Holland, Doron Tempert. Looking forward to chatting with you all; ask us anything! 

Hey everyone, thanks for making this such an amazing AMA, and thank you Reddit India for having us. It was very stimulating for the both of us, and is getting us more excited about our future work. Signing off with the reminder that Thithi is playing in theatres all over Karnataka and in Mumbai, Delhi, Pune and Chennai! We're hoping to come to other cities in the coming week. Please try and catch it on the big screen before it leaves theatres, the experience leads to a far more immersive willing suspension of disbelief :) Thanks again hope you all have a great night!"

Photography,Watching movies in India is a truly unique experience.,"Seriously, there is no dearth of weird shit that can happen. I went to watch Joker in an afternoon show and here is a list of things that happened.

1. Some guys came with Heath Ledger type facepaint and saste ka clown masks. They were denied entry because they didn't have ID to prove they were above 18. This bunch of Joker ""anarchists"" was then seen begging the security to let them in.

2. I overheard a guy was telling his girlfriend that Heath Ledger would make a cameo in this movie. I thought he was pranking her but he seemed to be convinced.

3. Another group of people (who I had the unfortunate experience of sitting next to later) were chanting anarchy slogans as they entered the theater. They were asked to shut up by the ushers. These same bunch proceeded to take videos and photos of ""iconic"" clips from the movie, sometimes with their flash on. Thankfully they were thrown out.

4. Someone's family member apparently died/hospitalized in the climax of the movie and he began crying loudly while on the call. He ran out after a few seconds but some people who were next to him were genuinely confused about whether to ask him to shut up or not.

5. I spotted a celebrity photographer in the theater watching the movie with his wife. I used to love his early work and it sort of inspired me into getting into amateur photography. I was contemplating throughout the movie what I will say to him or will he be cool to take a picture with me etc. I had them locked on while they were exiting and ended up standing right next to them in the dark exit hallway walking out. As I was about to talk to him, he and his wife started having an argument. I just continued walking past them and left thanks to the awkwardness.

Thoughts about the movie? It's great. Just try going for a show where you can avoid the college crowd. Dunno why these people worship The Joker."

Photography,[askindia] Am I really thinking wild? Confused. [career help],"I'm a 27 guy and currently working in a hectic job in a small town away from a big city with no like minded people around me or even friends to hang out. I'm stressed and with a lot of thoughts in my mind. One thought/idea ain't letting me sleep these days. I want to start a photography based business in a nearby big city. I've been in love for photography but since I've started working, I hardly get time. Don't have any like minded people around me, or even if, can't give much time. I've had a small business earlier which was unsuccessful but learnt a lot during college time. Now working for a year has got me a hang of how to deal with people, manage them, get results. 

Now coming back to my idea of photography and filmmaking business, it ain't any disruptive business but something I've loved. I have a small portfolio which ain't much impressive, not of any models in the photos but general landscape, street and travel. I don't intend to be the next fashion photographer either. So the idea is leave this work, get to the nearby city, start a photography firm with initially teaching the basics and advance of photography, not the costly ones but even college students which can afford. Side by side, also lectures from the well knowns in the field who might help me get some traction along with what I've been doing. I plan to get some amount of initial money from home for this. Pick up a few students, with some contacts, get some photography paid jobs. Get those students paid with some margin for me, get more contacts and  follow it up. The jobs I tend to initially get are concerts, photoshoots and even weddings. Photography instruments and cameras can be rented. A lot of things I feel I can do. 

But now the only fear is jumping out of my well paying hectic job at this age for something like this. How much harm will it do to my career if I fail out and if I want to go back to my work life again? How do I see the future when this field is jam packed with every photographer and film maker out there. I don't plan to bring anything different in photography but satisfied clients, good photographs and create a team which can deliver this with me. This all as happiness in what I will do and something belonging to me. 

I also thought of doing this after trying out for mba, as it might give me a cushion. Maybe help me out. But again confusing.

So how wild is this? I need some sane suggestions here, haven't asked my family or friends. 

I've not edited any part of this text, just raw, straight out of my confused mind. Please be gentle, already stressed and confused about all directions in career.

tl;dr: 27yo guy, hectic job, wants to leave for starting a photography business with not much experience and not a disruptive business but something just for happiness. Confused guy."

Did some research (I'm not the smartest when it comes to tech) and decided upon 3 phones - RealMe 2 Pro, Asus Zenfone Maxpro M2 and Mi A2.

Majority of my usage is streaming, texting, photography and social media. My usage is also rough

My requirements are:
1) Good lasting battery
2) Good build quality, durable
3) No lags
4) Good camera

I've read that all 3 phones are going to receive/have received Android Pie updates.

Also, what advantages do Stock Android offer over Color OS and vice versa?

Thank you."

Photography,Indian multimedia is horrendous.,"So I'm part of an multimedia help group. We volunteer, helping people from all over the world with various software, but mostly Photoshop. People will post their images or animations and ask for help or feedback which we assist with. 

Now I've been doing this for more than 8 years and I'm educated in art and multimedia design, and classically trained in print advertising. I'm also a graphic designer. So I know what I'm doing and I know what I'm talking about, as do the other volunteers. 

Now, India. Whenever we get an upload from India it's almost always a case of the following:

1. The work is terrible. Over use of vignette, blur, exposure, saturation. 
2. It's a ridiculous portrait. For example, some guy sitting on the roof of a Ferrari. 
3. It's almost always men of various ages working on images of themselves. Really over-acted poses and stares. Just, shit really, no matter how it's analysed. 
4. Despite the fact that it's a helping forum with clear instructions to post AND ask your questions, Indian work is NEVER posted up with any questions. It's just posted and left like, *""Look at my awesome work!""*

Now I'm not biased or racist or generalising and if you think I am, I couldn't give a shit. This is based on 8 years of experience and the simple, statistical reality of almost all posts that come in to our site from India. No other country's people act this way on our site. Every one else mostly posts reasonably good work of general artistic topics and asks for help on some level. Not Indians. It's always vain, childish trash that none of us volunteers can even begin to understand, and when we offer feedback (which is usually not positive but always polite) we meet incredible resistance. Like how dare we critique work and offer suggestions to work that is posted to our free art critiquing website? It's not a gallery. It's a help and critique site made very clear by all the comments and critique publicly displayed, **as well as** the rules stated upon posting. 

Even if you look at our collective ban list right now. 248 people banned in 8 years. 233 of them registered as being from India. 

So what's up with this, India? How do I better understand what's going on here? How do I help you to help yourselves? Why is your art and photography so self-centred, vain, and forgive me, just plain terrible, and why won't you listen to **free**, professional advice on a free, professional advice website that **you came to**?"

Photography,B.Tech. student with absolutely no idea what to do next...Need advice..,"I am a 4th year [B.Tech](https://B.Tech). computer science student from Kerala. I study in a well reputed college and have been scoring good marks ( 84% as of now, 8.4 CGPA) throughout my course although my scores seems to be dropping semester after semester.

I went for engineering coaching and got really interested to take it mainly because I wasn't exposed to any other streams other than engineering and medicine. So I took Computer Science as my degree because I had a faint interest in it and it had a lot of job opportunities. 

But since my second year I started hating computer science, every aspect of it. I know many like it but it's just a no-go for me. I tried many fields like Block chain, Web Designing (had a little interest, the coding part ruined it), Machine learning, IoT, etc. but nothing sparks any interest in me. Now, just hearing the fact that I have to do the project and seminar for next year just brings me pain.

Now I have no idea what to do. There are campus placements in my college the coming year and I don't think I can pass them in the case of interviews or logical questioning as I am really bad at coding and most theory parts. And even if I pass, I don't think I will be interested in the work too.

I have a lot of interest in studying architecture and anything that ignites the creative spark in me(which Computer science doesn't). I am interested a lot in Photography (I take good photos too) and Graphic Design as well. But the career scope in these are very small compared to computer science. Also I have no idea how to develop these skills to a career/professional level one without committing to them, which in turn waste my time on studies and computer science.

What should I do?  Do I continue with computer science till I get an interest in it (which I don't think I will) or should I change my whole career to something else that I am interested in??

EDIT: I know changing careers would be a huge task and risk for me so I am trying my best to find a suitable field for me in computer science itself. Changing careers is like my last resort and I wouldn't do it unless I really want to.
 Also is there any other subreddits I should post this to? For better response?"

Photography,I'm stuck with my career and could use some guidance. I am genuinely lost.,"This is a long post and I cannot tl;dr it because I need to explain my situation. Sorry about that!

So I am a 27-year-old who is a graphic designer by profession. I have been in this domain for 4 years and I can say I am alright at it. I am definitely not extremely good, but the last two places I worked, they were genuinely happy with my work. I got into this field in a weird way. I always liked to tinker with digital art, photography, etc. and I got a job as a designer straight out of college. Since then, I have worked in this field because I thought it was my passion and it was the only thing I could do to pay my bills. The more I worked in this field, the more I began to dislike graphic design. Over time, it became more of a chore for me. That's when I realized I am not passionate about it and just am in the field just because I have been in it for a while and I have some sense of design. For example, when I was working with a few brands, I just wanted to get the project over with so I can have some peace of mind. There was a lot of room for improvement but I didn't suggest it because more work for me. In the same train of thought, I am more than happy to be told what to do, and I will do it. Many passionate designers I met are completely against that idea. They want to give their own input and genuinely want to help their clients improve, but for me, it's just another deadline that needs to be done with. I also realized, if I have to compete with top designers to get better jobs, I have to improve my skills. Now, I would happily do it if I was genuinely passionate about it, but I know I am not.

I quit my last job in June and have been surviving on my savings since then and now it seems to be running out. Since, June, I was so happy that I don't have to wake up and do this shitty job. I still tinker around with digital art and have fun doing it and that's when I realized I began hating my hobbies because of this job. I am old now to understand this passion and drive I cannot cultivate in this field for sure. Now I have to look for a job. Realistically, I can work for any ad agency or even try my hand out with Amazon (I have already worked with them) or some other corporate where I could get paid a decent amount for some donkey job where I don't have to think much, etc. but I am feeling I will go back to hating my life and work again. I am okay with a boring 9 to 5 job even if it is some mind-numbing work, as long as the pay is alright and timings are decent. I don't expect the perfect life anyways, but I feel I need to change this.

Can any of you give me some solid career advice on this aspect? Should I just suck it up and continue working in this field especially when I am not passionate about it? I feel the only way I can make significant leaps in this field is my striving to constantly improve myself, but to do that, I need to genuinely love the work, which I don't. If not, what other options do I have? Some of my friends were telling me to get into hospitality since I am pretty good at talking to people and managing things and it also has a scope of me to go abroad (which is a long term plan for me). I feel going abroad bit will be severely hindered by graphic design because it's not a that sought after field with which I can move abroad.

If you would suggest I stay in graphic design, are there any schools or courses that can help me? I am a fully self-taught designer so I have never had a proper foundation of design sense and style. I had a helpful mentor in my last job, and he kept telling me don't go for studies in this field, just keep working and you will improve. I learned a lot from him in terms of my work improving and all.

Other than this, are there any other jobs or fields you would suggest?

Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!"

We have had many amazing posts this year which go from the entire subreddit grouping together to help people in Kerala with the largest donation drive ever on this subreddit with verified donations over ₹7,00,000 to paying college fees of a user who couldn't afford to. 

Here are some highlights in **no particular order** which made up this year of r/india: 

* [The massive Kerala donation drive started](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/981o7s/will_donate_thrice_the_number_of_upvotes_amount/) by /u/TheBeginnerr to match the donations to the upvotes of the thread inspired hundreds of Redditors to donate to the Kerala Disaster Relief Fund.  

* [Hindustan pencils responding to a request by a mother](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7k0muz/a_mother_wrote_to_hindustan_pencils_about_her/) sends special sharpeners created to be used by left-handed people with ease.

* [India and Pakistan bond over ](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8f0jig/pakistani_friend_of_mine_tried_a_lays_indias/) the flavour of Lay's India Magic Masala

* [Section 377 gets scrapped](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9dfine/gay_sex_has_been_decriminalised_in_india_the/) and gay sex gets decriminalized after one of the longest legal battles in Indian history and \#LoveWins.  
And the [beautiful image of a son no longer being considered a criminal](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9dt64s/if_you_are_not_moved_by_this_picture_i_wish_i_had/) became one of the highest voted posts of this year. 

* Among the many historical posts, r/india particularly loved the pictures of [three women training to be doctors (1885)](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7mczx1/an_indian_woman_a_japanese_woman_and_a_syrian/),  [historical photos of Bhagat Singh posted on the day of his death anniversary](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/86h70i/87_years_ago_today_shaheed_bhagat_singh_was/),  a [smog-free New Delhi from the 1950s](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9wow0r/new_delhi_in_1950s_clean_air_without_smog/), [a French boy introducing himself to Indian soldiers during the First World War](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7x16j8/a_french_boy_introduces_himself_to_indian/) and [Prof. C.V Raman teaching in 1960s](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9d7nxf/1960s_physicist_cvraman_teaching_in_class/).

* And a photo of kids at the [back of a school bus](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8ztvst/i_took_a_picture_of_a_school_bus_from_behind/) is always adorable, isn't it?

* A slightly [morbid imprint left on the Delhi Metro after years of use](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9ttt1x/this_mildly_interesting_imprint_left_behind_after/).

* [While this stunning photo not only became popular here, but rather all over other social medias](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8uzewx/this_is_india/)

* And an [absolutely stunning photo of a lightning strike taken by u/sick-of-this123](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9pgs4p/i_photographed_a_lightning_strike/)

* Some photographs are not meant to be beautiful, instead they are meant to make us think. [Surely this photo of a bridge in Kerala after it's flood makes us think](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/98kz12/this_is_the_photo_of_a_bridge_in_kerela_after_the/).

Photography,Dal lake on a fine sunny day!!!,
Photography,Broke up 30! What next???,"Hi Everyone,

I browse through reddit quite a bit and love the answers and support that comes especially under relationships/life.So here goes my story.

A little about myself. I'm 30 yr old Indian woman working in IT and earning well. I am the only kid and my mother raised me as a single parent after my dad left us.She has raised me to be independent and has given me freedom unlike other Indian families.

I had my share of relations when I was young and I was single for a considerable amount of time in mid 20's and I made good use of it. I started traveling and over years have come to love it. Travel opened doors for me in blogging and photography and my friends say I am decent at both. Being single also taught me value of friendships and I'm fortunate to have made some solid bonds over the years.

I met my bf (32 yrs) two years ago and with time we realized we do want to spend our lives together. As we started talking about future I realized that my bf is very keen to move to his hometown and take over his family business/ agriculture (he mentioned it casually once a yr ago. I had no idea he was serious about it).  I refused to agree for this as it is hard for me to relocate to a place which has zero opportunities for career. I hate the idea of staying at home or being dependent for finances. For the reasons above and also that I would be giving up all my friends,leaving my mom,work, travel everything for one person seemed like a bad deal.

We tried to come up with solutions but none of them made of us happy and hence agreed for mutual breakup. This breakup has left bitter feelings in me about everything. I want to stop feeling negative about my ex (somewhere I feel he could have stayed considering he has been staying in the city for 20+ yrs) and stop feeling sad for myself. I am scared that I might end up alone given the age taboo/caste etc in India and quite not sure how to deal with all the negativity in my head.Any suggestions are welcome!

Thanks,

Ablahnaari!

Photography,Its becoming hard/Impossible to find good CS jobs in India.,"But unlike some people, I am willing to dedicate more of my resources and skills to find the right fit.

Why can't employers do the same?

Edit: Some questions I read.

Z921 in their rant on another thread here:
> You need to have a hobby other than photography

Who are you to decide what hobby is worth my time? Sounds like you are the kind of person to micro-manage your employees and be on people's shoulders like vedhal is to vikramadithya. Also sounds like you are/will be the kind of parent who does not like what their child is doing and would like him/her to study engineering.

> DumbwitPatra:
> What is your expectation from an employer? How can I, as an employer, assess you and be sure you're unlike the others? Jobs ARE available. But the people aren't knowledgeable enough. Even engineering passouts with 80-85% can't crack simple dynamic programming questions. I hire based on a coding test I give on hackerrank. And out of 400+ CS engineers from tier 1 collegee, only 15 or 20 students (per college) could get three questions right in 3.5 hours. Because we want coders who have strong basics, we hire only there's people. If you're one among them, you'll get a job. If you aren't, you need to have visible proof that you have put in efforts to specialize in a particular field. The guy who is leading the AI team in my company is from BBA background. He learnt AI and math from the internet, built some applications and had content that would show his efforts. If you do have something like that, take your idea to a hackathon. You'll have your idea recognized even if you don't win and will get a job. However, I'm not sure if i understood your question right. What are you expecting from your employer and what change do you want to see in the way hiring is done?

Quantitative Aptitude exams. The messages you are sending to your prospective employees are:

* You only care about speed and memorizing power and nothing else about the developer because all your talk of github profiles and other hobbies does not come into play until you see my resume yourself which is usually after all the written rounds.
* For all the talk of being the risk takers in the industry, you don't want to trust your prospective employee so you pass up on a potentially good employee who may not have the best aptitude test taking skills.

What you expect to happen:

* You assume good aptitude problem skills imply good problem solving skills.
* You assume people won't game the aptitude round and learn just enough to pass that round.
* You assume that all the brilliant programmers solve the problems in no time and you are left with a roster of excellent developers.

What usually happens:

* People game the system and just study how to solve the test problems.
* Actually good developers may not have the time to study aptitude problems because, surprise! they are busy learning actual programming. Many good developers get filtered out in the first round due to the lack of knowledge in aptitude.

> I hire based on a coding test I give on hackerrank. And out of 400+ CS engineers from tier 1 collegee, only 15 or 20 students (per college) could get three questions right in 3.5 hours. Because we want coders who have strong basics, we hire only there's people.

15 or 20 students per college seems like the right amount of students who are actually passionate about their field. When the stakes are high, Skills go down a few notches. It's the observer effect. As soon as people find out they are being assessed or being watched they don't perform as well.

> What are you expecting from your employer?

* If you want Tom Cruise as your boyfriend, you need to be Cameron Diaz. If you want brilliant developers, you must be a innovating company who offers their weight in salary and/or Resume Value. If I am a good developer, then it is possible I know my worth. I am not going to put up with you for $400 a month or less.

* Stop taking credit for my work. I once heard that my friend got a pat in the back for making the company $12000. He never got a bonus or saw $1 of that money.

* I want you to stop whining and start treating employees like human beings. Pay them a proper wage and give them interesting problems to solve. Automate the boring stuff. Don't ask me to do the documentation manually. Haven't you heard of tools that do the documentation from comments in code?

* Once I am hired. I want a manager who actually understands what I am saying and not some prison warden who intimidates devs to get things done before a very early deadline that they came up with without consulting the devs. This is a sure way to make devs secretly hate you while burning out.

* I want reasonable work-life balance. I am passionate about programming, but I am a human being too.

* More investment into employee training or undergraduate education in the government. I know IT companies lobby a lot, so I expect them to actually put effort to improve the syllabus of colleges to suit what they want in terms of technical knowledge by diverting some money towards education.

> minusSeven:

> define ""good CS jobs"" please.

a job which makes you wake up early everyday.

I like CS actually.

> What are your qualifications ? Where's your GitHub link ? At onr end of the spectrum you have Google paying upwards of a crore per annum to people from IISc. At the other end you have people working as game testers for 10000₹ per month.

Yes but I am not the one whining about not finding good developers. It is the employers looking for good developers but are not willing to pay them a living wage.

> People working as game testers for ₹10000 per month

There is your problem. Why are you not willing to pay more?

I am not personally looking for a job. I have one. It is good but I notice the bad side of IT occasionally. Namely the ""this will do"" attitude from people who expect a lot for less. It's about managing your expectations as an employer when you are asking your employees to manager their expectations of their salary.

Photography,[R] Advice for a career in photography.,"I am asking for my brother who just finished his 12th and wants to pursue photography as a career. He does not want to become an engineer. Can you help me with the following:

A good coaching institution which he can go to over the weekend. M-F he will be pursuing some commerce course, cuz some degree in the backup.
I have found [Udaan](http://www.udaan.org.in/weekend_course.html), andheri, mumbai which does that.

What types of jobs do professional photographers get into? Is it true that the field is on a decline with smartphones?

Suggestion for a camera which he can kick start his career with. Budget = 30k

I am not in Mumbai but want to help him pursue what he likes and help me set on a good path.

Photography,[Career Advice] Exploring opportunity in IT sector.,"Hi fellow Indians. 

I would like your advice on prospective career development in IT sector. Though I am already working in field of art - photography, graphic designing, video editing etc. I am now looking for something new in IT as it has always been something that I am being recommended since past 20 years so thought why not give it a go. Those who are already in this field, please let me know what are my options. 

Let me first tell you about myself so that you may know where I stand right now and where should I begin. 

• I love learning about new technology, how it works, whats going on in background etc. I do easily figure out behind the scenes of a hardware or software by using it for a while or maybe after a bit of research. That’s why I am good at troubleshooting because I can easily identify the fault and works towards it and don’t even hesitate to go into rabbit hole if the problem demands it. 

• I also am a bit of tinkerer and like to develop my own things like using raspberry pi to make ot into my door opener, use it as DNS blocker (/r/pihole), make it into my own Alexa device, hosting my own websites and hardening the security of it etc. And now a days I am tinkering with NodeMCU to use it for home automation using the HomeKit by Apple. 

• Speaking of Apple, I love breaking the boundaries set by it in their iOS and do more than an average user (/r/Jailbreak). Because of things I mentioned in first point, I am also good at troubleshooting unique problems that only I am facing due to the combinations of tweaks I made in the system.

• Although I can understand most of the code and figure out the problem/BTS, modify it a bit according to my preference but I can not code the whole thing myself. 

Please let me know if this is enough to begin with or should I learn more before even thinking about any course or training. Also based on my information, what are my options and where should I start. 

If you are still reading, I thank you from the bottom of my heart for taking out time."

Photography,[R] Why are Indians blindly running after MONEY???,"What i dont understand is that why do Indians run for Money!!!. Wherever i look, everyday, i see Indians trying to get squeeze every inch of a penny from customers, trying to sell everything possible. etc. 

The people working for salaries like 50k or even 90k or 1.5L a month, don't actually have a life. to be honest ( MY opinion)

Okay, a person earning 1.5 L a month (like a cousin in delhi does) is extremely busy all the time. I have seen high earning salaried class, going to offices from 7 AM (2 hour drive) , returning at 10pm. Sometimes, they are thrown away to projects in other cities for months at a time. 

And in some places, Saturdays are also working. and on top of that, fierce competition, stress, anxiety. 

I know a person earning 3L a month. He has to go to office at 8am, and he returns at 11pm. He works in exports (Merchandiser). The stress he is in everyday in unbelievable. He suffers from insomnia and panic attacks. Is this MONEY worth your health???

People are dying In exchange for What? MONEY? shit doesnt get more stupid then this. 

Before people start burning me and asking me how i live my life. I basically started from scratch with clear goals in Mind when i made my own company at age of 21
1) Work only 4 hours a day
2) Holidays - 2 atleast in a year
3) No Stress related work
4) Debtfree forever
5) Self-Sustaining income
6) Passive income from investments

Today, even if i dont work, i can live through my life from passive income. Hell, i can live even without passive income. 

And a lot of Indians can live like the way i live. But they choose not to , for one simple reason. MORE MONEY. 

A lot of people i know personally. like 95% of them, live under loans. Car loans, house loans, credit card lines, PC limits, etc. They are basically stuck in a vicious circle of being a spend thrift and then working their asses off to pay the monthly obligations and creating more obligations for themselves for a FAKE future. 

Although when you transfer yourself into a more frugal and acceptable way of living, you will realise that the true happiness if being with your family, spending time with kids, chilling out in the sun and not thinking you will be late for office. And most importantly, being DEBT-FREE. Only after that you can think of creating Self-Sustaining earning for yourselves. 

Just ask yourself few questions and maybe they don't all apply to you, and maybe a few of them do. But if they do, just think why are you doing this? and creating Stress for yourself.
1. Why do you need a phone that costs 40k+?
2. Why do you need to buy a house on loan?
3. Why buy a car on loan? 
4. Why spend what you dont have yet (C.C.)
5. Why work more than 45 Hours a week? 
6. Why you go on a holiday and post pictures on facebook EVERYTIME? (Occasionally its okay)
7. Why do you put pictures of the food you eat on Insta, FB, Twitter??? 
8. Does it feel like, you are travelling to various places just to put pictures on your facebook and insta??? and if it does, why do you do it?
9. Dont you feel that your Job is hindering in doing what you actually LIKE? (Travelling, Hiking, Trekking, Exploring) etc.
10. Even if you can afford the most expensive phones? why do you ACTUALLY need it? have you asked yourself that? 
11. Have you lost touch with various people you loved? and WHY have you? Lack of TIME?
12. Do you want to learn something technical and CANT DO SO EVER? (Guitar, photography, boating, climbing, learning a piano, learning another language)

These are just A FEW of the things, which everyone of you must ask yourself. Because ultimately at the end, We are all going to die, one way or another. And to be brutally honest, a lot of people are going to regret how they lived their life. Not everything is about ""MORE MONEY"". And when you die, most probably you will be forgotten in 50 years. and that too if you become a celebrity. Otherwise, chances are you will be forgotten instantly. 

I have even seen people mentioning a ""BALANCE"". What balance? that you work for 6 days a week for 8 hours a day and then Sunday is a BALANCE? because that shit doesn't sound like a 50/50 balance to me. We sleep around 8 hours a day. And the rest of activities we SHOULD be doing in a day would constitute for around 7-8 hours (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Exercise, Errands). What you are left with is about 8 hours FREE. in which most of you only WORK. Exercise is totally forgotten. and even that 2 hours for exercise is given to work. 

Where is the time for yourself? to contemplate? to think? to feel about yourself? to do things you ACTUALLY want to do? 

I think even working for 4 hours a day is TOO MUCH. and should infact be only 2-3 hours. 

Money is just something the BANKS have created out of thin air, on which they ask you to pay an interest!!!. 

Have you thought about where the INTEREST money comes from which you pay??? . You guessed it, BANKS print them too. There is no Way out of the DEBT system. 

Only changes in your lifestyle and the way you feel about the world can result in self sustainable income and environment , where you can do things you want. 

Think about these things deeply.

Photography,Kota District Collector's letter to the parents of IIT aspirants [NP],"Dear Parents,

On behalf of Kota City, I take this opportunity to welcome your child to a city of wonders which processes the young minds of this country and fuels their passion to become the architects of Modern India.

My humble request at the beginning of this letter is to read this with some patience and time and it would be ideal if both the parents can read this together.

It is the dream of every parent to see his child touch the pinnacles of success and reach places which only few can afford. Every parent plants a seed in the mind of the child which over a period of time bears fruits but after careful nourishment and tendering since the seed is so tender that any mishandling may fail us from realizing our dream.

It is a very difficult situation for parents to leave their child in a place where they do not live and things become still difficult when the purpose for which the child is left behind is for dedicated and committed efforts in scaling excellence in education.

When parents look at the huge billboard signage/hoarding/ newspaper clips depicting pictures of young beautiful children who have achieved what they dream for their child, the resolution to inspire and motivate their children becomes still stronger.

Good career in the field of Engineering & Medicine, as the case may be, is more or less like certain insurance in terms of decent earning and living standards. I sincerely think that in most of the cases, this is the very reason that makes us dream such careers for our children.

There is nothing wrong in thinking on a certain kind of Assured Career Insurance for one’s child since limited resources and high degree of competition demands one to think ahead of times.

However, I think we all agree that the world too has changed drastically in the last 15-20 years so much so, that most of the facilities and services that were available for a limited few are now available to many due to the huge progress in technology which was witnessed in this period.

Art, Entertainment, Professional Sports, Literature, Health & Fitness, Entrepreneurship, Journalism, Photography, Event management, Music, Adventure, Destination tourism, etc, to name a few too witnessed immense growth in comparison to the bygone era.

Many of these even created a new niche which not just nurtured creative potential of the human mind and its capabilities but also were very successful career options.

Well, the point is not about asking you to see them as better options but certainly to see them also as options.

It is a matter of fact that today, young children are facing immense amount of pressure relating to their academic performance and due to the same many of them go through various levels of stress.

Even if we consider that a certain element of stress would exist in competition parental support, care and the right kind of family situations would help the child to cope with any difficult situation.

However, current reality is that due to the lack of right kind of conditions and support systems, many children are going through stress uncared and unattended for and in a few cases such situations disabled the children to such an extreme extent that they committed suicide…

Don’t get frightened suddenly as to what is being said about your child… Your child is perfectly safe and sound and you have no reasons to worry, but you have reasons to have concern of your child which I believe you will understand as we read my letter further.

I consider myself a very unfortunate person because I got a chance to read around 20-25 Suicide Notes of Young, Brilliant, Beautiful and Wonderful Children.

Am I giving so many adjectives to such children because they committed Suicide?

I am sorry. Answer is No… They were in fact, as I said earlier, Young, Brilliant, Beautiful and Wonderful Children.

A Girl with an amazing command of English language in her suicide note (grammatically perfect 5-page Suicide Note with beautiful running handwriting) thanks her mother for giving up her career for raising the children… Subtle hint that she was pricked on this matter again and again.

Another girl wants her grandmother to become her mother in her next birth. Another requests her parents to allow her younger sister to do what she likes and not what they like. One tells candidly that he was manipulated to study science which was not his taste. Many simply write in fewer lines that they could not fulfil the expectations of their parents. Rather few say they were not really capable of doing what is being asked for by them.

All of them thought that Death was a much peaceful and effortless action than going through this dilemma of artificially doing what parents want them to do.

As they say “Tip of the Iceberg” reveals little and hides mountains within, similarly apparent Suicide Cases reflect numbers but reality or the hidden mountain is all those children who did not opt to take this extreme step but certainly are going through stress/worry/anxiety due to pressure on performance.

Many Parents cannot believe after the disaster that it was their own child who took such a drastic measure and I don’t mean to hurt their sentiments any further but the reality is that the child was mentally looking for some blade of grass which a drowning man searches for. That blade of grass could have been your simple appreciation of his efforts… your solacing words of comforts of asking him to do his best and forget the results your absolute unconditioned appreciation of his extraordinariness.

In return, what the child got was threats of performing still better…psychological manipulation by repeat and re-telecasting of the hardships you have gone through for the sake of family. comparison with better performers (neighbors, relatives, children of colleague, ancestors…could be anyone) sharing imagination on the loss/notional gain of social status being dependent on child’ s performance.

We need to understand that statistically speaking not many children commit suicide in comparison to the total number of children coping with such academic pressure if we analyze the numbers but life analysis tells us that their hopes and dreams are overlooked and hurt many a times. So it is high time we pause and contemplate a bit. I need to take a pause here since I hear many of you saying kids do not like many things which are good for them. So the question I tend to hear from you is… Should parents go childrenâ€™s immature ways? Not necessarily.

Well let us try to see what all good things they resisted… Eating right, sleeping right, talking right, behaving right, seeing right, listening right, reading right etc.

Child actually observes parents and never follows anything blindly. Moreover, there is one thing which is certain… Child analyses and looks at the parents to see whether in case any of those things preached are followed by parents to begin with and if so..Whether their parents are really loving, joyful, peaceful and happy by doing so.

They tend to pick up only those habits of their parents that make them happy and peaceful…In case you have seriously messed up situations, your child may even not like you.

It may appear strange and extremely annoying… But there is a possibility of your child not liking you… This comes in many forms and shades. Absolute dislike, not liking few traits of yours, not liking you by comparing you with someone better, not liking you for your over protective care and concern which you may think as love but is suffocating for the child, not liking you for your double standards (we may have…) etc.

So, is it the objective of this letter to make you realise that your child dislikes you?

Answer again is a big No.. Your child does not dislike you… I am just making a point that unconsciously we may have created such a situation, which we need to undo…

Children are parents’ responsibility and we are no one to teach a parent their responsibility nor do we intend to do so… Parents really think good for their children’s future but the point I need to make is that your dreams are always limited to your experience of what is good… what is successful… what is the best thing… Well, the truth is your child may surpass your imagination and reach places which you never even dreamed of…

We all come from different segments of the society in terms of social & economic status, culture, religion, belief systems etc. However as far the natural principle of upbringing a child is concerned they remain the same everywhere.

I am not an expert in Parenting nor have many credentials in “Right Child Care Practices” and I fully understand that different kind of children need different kind of interventions yet I would request you to divert little attention to these fundamental aspects relating to child management.

Creating the right kind of atmosphere for the child to grow and flower in home by making home a really happy, loving and peaceful place to live.
Understanding the needs of the children. There are two extremes in this case…Making the child go through terrible hardships to realise “Your” dreams is one end and the other end is over-pampered care… Both of them definitely do not work.

Take time to switch from teaching mode to learning mode from the child since children show you the way to be really happy and peaceful at times…Instead of learning form them we tend to always assume the role of teacher/preacher.

Allow the child “to be” on his own terms and here I mean especially the child’s engagement with nature and world around and empower them with the right kind of communication skills which are more accommodative. Interaction with the other gender due to their coming of age is not an aberration but a normal process, which you can keep a note on but not try to prevent it totally.

Spend time with children without complaining of your office, life situation, problems, hardships all the timeâ€¦. It may be really too late before you want to spend and there is no more time available with the child. Why? Because we may have made him just like ourselves in an effort to tutor him. We certainly are not the benchmark for the child. Many a times, we may be regressive rudimentary types in comparison to the ability of the child.

Just a final thought. Are we interested in making the child realise “Your Dreams” at any cost or should it be like creating such situations that the child realises “His/Her” Dreams?

I could have simply attended a Parents Counselling Session during admission and spoken on these issues but usually it so happens that in such gatherings we are conditioned and influenced more by impression of the person sitting next to you or people who think different.

Nothing wrong in disagreeing but it is best to disagree on own terms instead of getting influenced by others. Finally, I would like to tender my unconditional apology for taking your time and telling you things about Child Management in which I am no expert and my words in this letter have been gathered by my limited experience in Kota dealing with similar cases and certainly there are great men who have inspired me to put my thoughts before you.

Be the Best Parent in the World!!!!
I am sure there is no competition there

I have a friend who followed his passion of photography and is pretty good at it. He got a degree in photography.

But he is finding it difficult to find a job. He has tried everywhere but can't seem to find any good jobs. He is getting very depressed and lost interest in life. It breaks my heart to see a guy who followed his dreams and is giving up now.

I do not have any idea of the career trajectory of a photographer. If you guys could shine some light on where and how he could apply or look for jobs that would help him a lot.

If you guys know of any job opening that would be great too."

Photography,"Anyone aware about the dynamics of worklife amd workplace politics, casteist politics of the under mentioned job(s)?","So fundamentally, I am in my third year of engineering at the moment and I have decided( although not wholeheartedly) that I will go for the government exams primarily because I want 1. stability,  2. recognition 3. Work life balance and 4. so that I can work o my hobbies viz ekectric guitar, photography and travelling

The government exams which I think tick the boxes for me is IAS, solely ( Though I will sacrifice my hobbies for that obviously as the responsibility would be much greater in magnitude). The backups which I think would work well are

1. UPSC CSE( IRS , specifically because it is all in all a desk job in my estimation, also is a great backup if I attemp the CSE again the subsequent year)
2. UPSC IFoS, for obvious reasons
3. SSC CGL( I have heard ministry of external affairs department has a few desk jobs. Also, ASO)
4. RBI Grade B, I heard that bank exams are mostly riddled with casteist policies such as late promotions and the like

What do you suggest? I have an aptitude for the social science subjects in general and psychology, philosophy in particular. In addition to that, I like to think that I am fairly decent in analytical reasoning and the rest of aptitude reasoning tests and even if I wasnt I could well develop and sharpen them as I still have two more years"

He messed it up very badly.

2. ITI
3. Any vocational course

Photography,Visiting India,"Hello everyone,

I am going to be visiting India soon for a business trip. I will be meeting up with our business friend, which is the reason for my visit. We will be in New Delhi, and I just have some random miscellaneous questions and I would enjoy talking to actual Indians instead of reading someone's travel blog. Above all, I want to make sure I'm not disrespectful to anyone.

Firstly, I am interested in doing some photography of my time here, both of the incredible buildings and of the culture. Is it considered disrespectful to do what we call ""street photography"" which is essentially taking pictures of the things, buildings, and people while walking around? What is the locals attitude towards a white guy like me walking around taking photographs?

Secondly, what are some good places to visit near New Delhi? I believe we will be going to the taj Mahal, and I would also like to go to red fort, humayuns tomb, etc. I know these are touristy, but I'm coming across the world and would like to see them.

If anyone has any questions for me I'd love to talk as well, it's always interesting to learn about others culture."

Photography,What are photography laws in India for public places?,"I just got into an argument with my friends who were under the impression that it is illegal to take photographs of a person without their permission even in a public place. I was dazed by their belief and their view of morality regarding that. Shortly after they withdrew from the conversation, refusing to talk further and leaving me frustrated.

 I could find only a little information concerning the matter on internet. And I have a lot of questions now. There doesn't seem to be any unified concrete law for photography. If there is one please let me know. 

An important article I found [here](http://blog.sujitshetty.com/2009/04/photographers-rights-in-india.html) has this information
>Passengers are now also permitted to take photographs from inside an aircraft while in flight or landing/take off at civil aerodromes. 

Which reminds me of the [arrest of 3 for taking picture of air hostesses](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/hindu-mahasabha-functionary-among-3-arrested-for-taking-pictures-of-air-hostesses-in-indigo-flight/)

Now I am not saying whether it was morally justified to take her photos when she clearly objected, but I am questioning whether it is illegal. So if I go to a public park and take a photo of a woman, does she have the power to put me into jail if I don't delete the photos on her request?

In the aforementioned case, the persons were charged under *IPC Section 354*(assault or criminal force to **woman** with intent to outrage her modesty) and under the *Sexual Harassment of* ***Women*** *at Workplace* (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act. 

This brings me to another question, is taking pictures of a woman without consent an act of sexual harassment? And what would have been the charges if the flight attendant was a man instead of a woman?

Policy/Economy,What is the biggest reason for migration in India?,
Policy/Economy,"In view of current state of economy, wasn't idea of Basic Monthly Income, an worthwhile experiment ?","To people who oppose govt giving sops to people, here is my argument.

Since economy works with buy-sell of products and services, current slowdown can be attributed to 

A. Cash crunch in hands of citizens. (I mean income, not currency notes)

B. Oversupply of pricey products.

C. Lowered consumer sentiment.

Etc etc... You must have got my point by now...


Since GST and demonetization, money from parallel market is invested (cough! Real estate! Cough! Gold!) And any bulk sale of these asset will raise suspicion.

Thus it's slowdown.

And since people are waiting for things to be rosy again, they are willing to wait for luxuries.

Now comes BMI. 

IF govt decides to push money to poor households...

Purchasing power of poor will multiply manyfolds.

And assuming, they will go buying...

Economy might revert back to health.

Basis for my understanding: was talking to a prof of commerce. Was talking about  current slowdown. When he pointed towards 2008 depression and MNREGA. He explained about the bottom byuoncy which kept local economy in good health despite external flu. This enrichment of lower strata of society with cash flow kept demand high thus subverting depression and subsequent rejuvenation of economy when depression subsided in world economy.

Since MNREGA is still available, on this he told... Economy has now equilibrated with  effect of MNREGA. 

His view about recent spurt of economic activity in Kashmir was favourable.

Policy/Economy,"Excuse me, what the fuck!","There have been reports (which I'll be linking at the end of this post) of AAP considering traveling for women by buses and metro to be completely free of cost. With a few months to go for assembly elections, this move by AAP seems more of desperate measure to rope in all the women voters.

Considering 25% percent of the riders to be women, the finances absolutely do not work out. There are already glaring issues regarding the safety of women and providing freebies is definitely not the way to go about it.

I have attached the annual report of DMRC which clearly shows that it is eventually finding its way to profitability. Making metro commute free for women will be a hugely regressive step in the existing scheme of things.

This proposal will not only fuck the DMRC finances but also the increase in footfall will be catastrophic for the management and also for the fellow commuters who are *paying* for the metro rides. I am an average randian and it took me a few minutes to predict the possibility of this glaring repercussion. Imagine the issues that will be discovered if this step is analyzed thoroughly.

Access to the  internet is a human right. Massive economic, social and individual harm  caused when it is disrupted. But the human costs are much deeper.  Cutting off Internet access prevents people from using the Internet to  reach out for help, and makes them panic. They cannot make sure their  loved ones are safe, or practice their right to expression and political  participation - the government cannot unreasonably deny anyone in this  country this right. We believe that internet based communications play a  vital role in promoting greater trust between people and their  government.

Arguments on security and public safety which are  often made have resulted in a situation where India has the highest  number of internet shutdowns globally. Most of these happen in Jammu and  Kashmir. As per SFLC’s internet shutdown [tracker](https://internetshutdowns.in/)  this is the 51st time (atleast) this year that Kashmir has faced an  internet shutdown and it won’t be the last until there is a serious  reform on shutdown laws.

We have through our work consistently  over months highlighted how it results in harm to different parts of  India. From Rajasthan, West Bengal, Maharashtra. But tonight, we are  concerned about Jammu and Kashmir. People there who are suffering from  anxiety and bewilderment due to a deprivation of internet and mobile  communication services. We are concerned for their safety, physical and  mental care. 

The last few days has underscored the need for legal  reform given that as per our understanding the existing law under which  orders for internet disruptions are passed undermine our fundamental  rights. **IFF urges the government to stop these arbitrary shutdowns that lack any sort of structure or oversight.**

**ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS-JOY FOR INC, WAKE-UP CALL FOR BJP**

**Can the Congress upset the odds in 2019?**

The biggest question everybody had before today’s results was can the Congress fight back against Modi and BJP, especially with 2019 around the corner. While their performance in Telangana and Mizoram was disappointing, it will take heart from its wins in Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh. 

For a party which was in disarray until a year and half ago with no clear sense of direction from the party high command, the Congress has slowly staggered back onto its feet to fight the Modi and Shah duo. With a seemingly reinvigorated Rahul Gandhi at the helm, they have taken the fight to the BJP in Modi’s own bastion-Gujarat, cobbled together an alliance in Karnataka and now snatched Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh back from the BJP. 

While the party is trying hard to capitalise on the anger of the masses against the Central government’s policies and decisions, the Congress still has a lot of work to do on the ground level if it seriously wants to come back to power in 2019. While the results might show Congress winning in three states, there is a very distinct and real possibility that voters were fed up with their state BJP governments due to anti-incumbency and they are still going to vote for Modi to become the PM again in 2019.The Congress’s performance in Rajasthan is also considered to be relatively disappointing with chaotic seat distribution, infighting and rebel Congress leaders costing the party another 15 odd seats.

**What next for the BJP?**

While the results aren’t going to make BJP workers too happy, the BJP still remains in pole position to come back to power in 2019. With the so called ‘Third Front’ still nowhere near fruition and the Congress’s efforts to pitch RaGa against NaMo not exactly gathering steam with other opposition parties means that Modi continues to be the most popular political leader in India currently. The extradition of Christian Michel related to the Agusta Westland scam and the recent court order allowing the extradition of Vijay Mallya from the UK also serve as a timely boost to the BJP’s anti-corruption rhetoric, which was on a slippery slope after the Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi sagas. The BJP has also made no effort to hide its Hindutva agenda, starting with the renaming of Allahabad to Prayagraj and Faizabad to Ayodhya. BJP led state governments in Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh also cleared the way for the building of gigantic statues of Lord Shiva and Rama respectively and this Hindutva pitch will only get more brazen in the lead-up to 2019.

While the BJP might be smug about its chances in 2019, it has to keep an eye on the grumbling middle class and farmers-both unhappy with poll promises not being kept. The agrarian distress and lack of job creation have taken the shine off Modi’s ‘booming economy’ pitch and the BJP will be anxious to ensure it doesn’t snowball further. Furthermore, the central government’s rift with the RBI and frequent clash-ins with the Supreme Court have created the image of an overzealous central government keen to take control of all independent central agencies. 

**Will KCR lead for the formation of a Third Front?**

TRS’s emphatic victory in the state of Telangana and K Chandrashekar Rao’s victory speech might mean the resurgence in the chances for the formation of a Third Front consisting of other regional satraps including Mamata Banerjee and Mayawati. The Third Front has traditionally been a cluster of regional parties which choose to neither align with the Congress or the BJP. However, the Third Front, which has always been talked of as an alternative to India’s two-party stronghold, has never managed to give a serious fight to the Congress or the BJP in recent history. The only times the Third Front or Federal Front provided a serious threat to the Congress or BJP was in between 1996 and 1998 when it staked power at the Centre twice under H.D. Deve Gowda. Quite predictably, the government collapsed soon after due to infighting and horse-trading of MPs. 

It will be interesting to see if a Third Front comes into existence in time for 2019 and more interestingly, if they can prevent making the mistakes that they have committed in the past and become a force to reckon with.

**Controversy about EVMs**

Adding further fuel to the EVM tampering controversy, it was reported this week by multiple news sources that CCTV malfunctions occurred in the strongrooms where the EVMs were stored. Technical snags in CCTV systems installed inside the storage rooms came from Vidisha, Mandla and Bhopal. In Vidisha, it is reported that CCTV cameras went blank for 15 minutes while the one in Mandla went blank for 2 hours. Tough questions must be asked of the Election Commission as to how such a situation was allowed to develop in the first place and what it plans to do to ensure the electoral system isn’t compromised."
Policy/Economy,So coincidental..,
Policy/Economy,Demolishing Some LCA Tejas Falsehoods,"_""The Tejas is an old design. It has taken 32 long years to develop! And despite being in development for so long, it isn't truly indigenous. Its heart, the engine, is of foreign origin. So are its weapons and some avionics. Furthermore, it is so deficient in its performance, that the Indian Air Force (IAF) wants Rafales/Su-30MKIs/F-16s instead.""_

Every time the Tejas achieves some important milestone, these criticisms are repeated ad nauseum, in the popular media, on Twitter, on internet forums, and at bhel-puri stalls in Jhumritalaiyya. It's infuriating to see an effort of this magnitude, one that has produced [many successes](http://www.ibnlive.com/blogs/india/saurav-jha/the-radiance-of-tejas-a-bright-prospect-for-make-in-india-10879-748651.html), being panned time and again. So I've taken the liberty to put together this handy-dandy LCA Tejas mythbusting guide to counter them.

And without wasting your time any further, I'll jump right in.

**False Argument 1: The Tejas is ""late"". It has been under development for 32 years!**

The figure is technically true, but deprives the narrative of much-needed context. The Tejas’ origins can indeed be traced back to 1983, when the concept of a Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) was conceived. However, the IAF did not finalise its air staff requirements (ASRs) until 1985 and initial funding did not come through until 1986. The project definition phase—the phase in which technical requirements are defined and a conceptual design prepared did not end until 1988. The final design was completed in 1990. Full funding was issued only in 1993, after which the development of a prototype commenced in earnest. See [this list of milestones](http://www.tejas.gov.in/history/milestones.html) for reference.

Following several years of delay in the development process—delays that can at least partly be traced back to overly optimistic R&D timeline projections, scope creep, and [US sanctions on India](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-05-31/news/39655783_1_drdo-chief-v-k-saraswat-lca-project) following the 1998 nuclear tests—the Tejas had its first flight in 2001. From then, the project proceeded at a pace that is not too different that of comparable fighter aircraft development programmes worldwide. It is slated to achieve final operational clearance (FOC), the stage at which an aircraft is considered fully ready for squadron service, in early 2017; fifteen years from the date of the first flight. At this time, the it is expected to be ready to carry out multiple functions: beyond visual range (BVR) air-to-air combat, short-range dogfighting, and precision ground attack with a variety of guided and unguided weaponry.

That compares well with contemporary fourth-generation fighters like the Eurofighter Typhoon and the JAS-39 Gripen. The first technology demonstrator of what would later be called the Typhoon first flew [in 1986](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Eurofighter_Typhoon). The definitive version with an AESA radar is [still not in service today](https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/euroradar-nears-flight-test-phase-for-captor-e-on-ty-416564/), 30 years down the line. The Tranche-2 version, which can drop precision bombs and fire BVR missiles, wasn't available [until 2008](http://www.raf.mod.uk/equipment/typhoon.cfm). Another European fighter, the Swedish Gripen-C, with full-spectrum capabilities, started entering service in 2002, also fourteen years after its first flight. 

The Tejas is about to FOC with all of these capabilities in late 2016. The fact that ADA managed to achieve similar or better timelines with the Tejas after its first flight, that too without the benefit of half a century of experience in building advanced fighters or the industrial ecosystem that enables such high-technology to proceed swiftly, is an achievement that is not given enough credit.

**False Argument 2: Because of the inordinate delays in development, the Tejas is now deficient.**

Just because the development was delayed doesn't mean that the design is the same one from 1983. The IAF updated its requirements quite often and kept demanding additional capabilities throughout the design and development phase. It was a Catch-22 situation: the constant change in requirements kept the design up-to-date, but it also led to several years of delays because of the need to re-design, re-test, and re-certify subsystems after every modification. Off the top of my head, I can remember that the IAF demanded the following modifications pretty late into the program:

* Open avionics architecture.
* Precision bombing capabilities.
* Heavier A2A missiles (R-73 vs R-60).
* Internal EW suite that included a self-protection jammer.
* Inflight refueling
* More capable radar and missiles (LCA Mk-1A)

With these modifications, the Tejas went from being a simple point-defence interceptor to a full-blown (albeit short-legged) multi-role fighter. 

**False Argument 3: The LCA falls short on several performance parameters like empty weight, range, turn rates, etc. The IAF has allowed 53 concessions/permanent waivers in the design.**

Like the 32-year delay, this too is a scary looking quote that paints a false picture of how fighter aircraft programmes work.

First off, it is important to remember that the Tejas can carry out most of the tasks intended of it quite competently. It can fight other aircraft at beyond visual range (when equipped with an AESA radar and Derby/Derby-ER missiles, it could end up becoming _the most capable_ BVR platform in IAF service). The addition of an Israeli helmet-mounted sight coupled to missiles whose seekers have a wide field of view (R-73 and Python IV/V) make it a fearsome dogfighter and compensate for minuscule shortfalls in aerodynamic performance. It can drop laser-guided bombs on ground targets with great precision. It is also very easy to fly. [In the words of the IAF](http://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/air-force-drdo-pleased-with-tejas-performance-at-bahrain-116022200321_1.html), the fighter’s ""control harmony is comparable to the best in the world… The intuitive cockpit layout and highly reliable life support systems provide for comfort as well as excellent situational awareness."" There are many such triumphs; too many, in fact, to recount here.

Secondly, _every_ fighter project concludes with specifications that aren't met, or a few deficiencies in performance. It’s never that big of a roadblock to induction in service. And all said and done, 53 is a very small number as far as design concessions go; a pretty small portion of the entire range of capabilities. Even simpler aircraft (like the [C-17]( http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19910528&slug=1285732)) enter service with more deficiencies. These are either compensated with using improvements in other areas to offset performance shortfalls, or accepted in the interest of availability for combat. 

Again, I shall go back to the Eurofighter Typhoon to illustrate my point. Remember I mentioned that it first flew in 1986? Twenty-two years later, it [couldn't independently drop a laser-guided bomb](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/07/01/eurofighter_austere_air_to_ground_what_joy/) on a target with any precision. Basic BVR combat capability was not available until Tranche 2 models were procured [in 2008](http://www.raf.mod.uk/equipment/typhoon.cfm), 14 years after the first flight. Even in close air combat, its capabilities were decidedly limited. The helmet mounted sight (HMS)—a system that allows the pilot to cue weapons onto an enemy aircraft by simply turning his head and offers a quantum jump in dogfighting capabilities—did not enter service [until 2010](https://www.eurofighter.com/about-us).

The F-35 was hobbled by similar issues (and terrible program management) [for several years](http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2013/09/joint-strike-fighter-lockheed-martin). It didn't begin to turn a corner until 2012 or so, after which it began rapidly demonstrating some of the capabilities that were expected of it.

The companies running these projects were aero giants with decades of experience behind them. How then does one expect the ADA, which has never developed a fighter in its entire existence, to deliver a more capable product while experiencing fewer failures? 

Thirdly, the IAF itself works with deficient designs all the time. The Gnat and Su-7, both hobbled by short ranges and limited payloads, were procured in large numbers. The MiG-21, when initially inducted, was underwhelming. Its range was limited and its missiles didn't work. The Bison is still riddled with issues. The Jaguar had a deficient nav-attack suite. It was practically useless in the long range strike role until the IAF and HAL developed and implemented the [DARIN upgrades](https://tkstales.wordpress.com/2010/03/07/the-darin-story/). The MiG-27's navigation system [never performed satisfactorily](http://www.livefistdefence.com/2010/07/special-report-story-of-indias-mig-27.html), and its reliability was terrible. But none of this troubled the IAF. Why then is the LCA failing to achieve a handful design parameters something to raise a huge hue and cry about?


**False Argument 4(a): The LCA isn't really indigenous. Many of its subsystems are of foreign origin.**

But many more of its critical subsystems are of Indian origin too! The first one that comes to mind is the carbon-fibre composite airframe. It is a very high-end product that reduces weight (thus permitting the carriage of a substantial external payload), aids maintenance, brings down manufacturing time, and so on. The fact that some of the technology involved in its manufacture has been exported to Airbus is a testament to its success.

Another example is the digital fly-by-wire (FBW) system, developed from scratch by ADA scientists in India after their work, notes, and equipment was impounded by Lockheed Martin in 1998. No country on earth, not one, has developed such a complex system and gotten it to work perfectly on the first try. It works so well that when it was first tested on an F-16XL in the US (this was before the nuclear tests), it improved the test-bed's handling qualities in several flight regimes. There is a reason the Tejas' test pilots call the aircraft to fly.

There are many other examples. The avionics. The mission computers. The navigation equipment, displays, and human-machine interface. The EW systems. This stuff isn't trivial by any yardstick.

Now coming to the foreign components aboard the aircraft. With the exception of the Americans, and to an extent the Russians, _every_ country has used foreign subsystems extensively in its aircraft designs. The [Gripen](http://www.airframer.com/aircraft_detail.html?model=JAS_39_Gripen) has an American engine, a British airframe design, Swiss carbon-fibre, an Italian radar, an American flight control system, a cockpit with critical components purchased from Britain, and so on. This in spite of the Swedes having an industrial base that is far more advanced than India's and extensive experience developing cold-war fighters such as the Draken and Gripen. The Rafale and Typhoon both use American ejection seats. Their flight control system uses actuators from Moog, an American company. The Russians were buying [Damocles pods](https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/russian-fighters-to-use-thales-damocles-targeting-pods-220747/) for the Su-35s before the French stopped military exports after they invaded Crimea. Nearly every Chinese fighter in service today uses a Russian engine, a Russian ejection seat, and a slew of Russian weaponry. If these aircraft all qualify as ""indigenous"", then surely the Tejas does too?

The choice that Indian design agencies faced was quite stark: should they have tried to build every little component in-house, thus reinventing the wheel at every step? Or used technologies/sub-systems available easily in the market in the initial stages and then made an attempt to indigenise over the life-cycle of the product? It's obvious that the latter was the more sensible path to take.

In the final analysis, the Tejas is an aircraft that has been designed by Indians in India, and is tailored to Indian requirements. If that doesn't make it indigenous, I don't know what does.
	

**False Argument 4(b): Okay, I get that. But the aircraft's very heart, its engine, is fully imported! Surely it's an utter failure on that front?**

Yes and no. It has had a very protracted development cycle, and for good reason. A jet engine is arguably represents the pinnacle of modern technology, making it the most challenging system in the world to develop from scratch. It has to produce ungodly amounts of power for its size and operate at the very edge of what physics allows. The GE F404—which ended up replacing the Kaveri on the LCA—weighs just a shade over 1000 kg and develops close to 80 kN of wet thrust. Assuming that it propels the LCA to Mach 0.9 at sea level (1,100 km/h), it's developing about 24,400 kW or 32,700 hp. That's 32 hp per kg. In contrast, a Formula-1 car engine generates ""only"" 8 or 9 hp per kg, and it's about as far as one can get with piston engines.

What does it take to generate so much power? One needs critical components like turbine blade assemblies that see inlet temperatures of 1,400°C or so while being subject to extreme forces. A back-of-the envelope calculation using rectally extracted figures tells me that a single high pressure turbine blade weighing 50 gm, and rotating at 16,000 RPM at the end of a 500 mm diameter disk, will be subject to a centrifugal force of about 3,500 kgf. Imagine two Honda Civics hanging off a tiny blade that is about as large as two of your fingers held together. There is a transverse load component as well; the 80 kN of thrust is distributed over the turbine blades. 

In order to sustain such loads, exotic materials and precision manufacturing techniques are required. Steel melts at about 1400°C, and starts rapidly losing strength at less than 500°C, so it's obviously not an option. Modern engines instead use nickel-based superalloys. Moreover, the material can't simply be cast or forged or machined into shape. The blade has to be produced via directional solidification or grown out of a single crystal in what looks more like a lab than a production shop. The shape, too, is very intricate. There are internal channels that route cold air taken from the compressor to the surface of the blade to keep it cool.

The fan, compressor, combustor, gearbox assemblies, bearings ... they're just as complex. And they all have to be precision manufactured to ensure that microscopic imbalances don't end up leading to excessive vibrations that could end up destroying the engine and the aircraft while in flight. Then there are requirements like safety, fuel efficiency, minimum total technical life, and reliability that add multiple layers of complexity to the design.

Now imagine the magnitude of effort required to develop something like this, with practically zero infrastructure and very little in terms of  a pre-existing knowledge base. And with skinflint bureaucrats refusing to approve requests for funding, test equipment, or manufacturing tools without documentation being submitted in triplicate and subject to audit after audit.

Now let us talk costs. The GTRE spent [Rs. 2,000 crore](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/rs-2101-crore-spent-on-development-of-indigenous-kaveri-engine-heres-why-theres-been-a-delay/articleshow/48282481.cms), or approximately $640 million in equivalent US dollars (with all the exchange rate and inflation variations that happened between 1989 and now taken into account), on developing the Kaveri. This seems like a lot, until you see that advanced nations spend billions on such programmes, and they almost never develop clean-sheet designs. They are always building on existing knowledge and existing designs. 

[Jeff Immelt, the CEO of GE says](http://www.businessinsider.com/interview-with-ge-ceo-jeff-immelt-on-transforming-ge-2015-12), ""If you could make something with 60 people in a garage, GE shouldn't be doing it. But if you make a jet engine, there's only like one and a half people in the world that can make a jet engine. And we are really good at that. If you want to compete with that, you've got to put yourself on a wayback machine and go back 25 years and invest $1 billion here for 25 years and then _maybe, just maybe_ [emphasis mine], you're going to be able to compete with us.""

Think about that for a second. It requires 25 years. And a billion dollars. And then too, you're more likely to fail than succeed.

The Chinese have been pouring money and espionage resources into their jet engine development efforts (they have budgeted [300 billion yuan](http://www.reuters.com/article/uk-china-engine-idUSLNE89T00W20121030)—about 45 billion in today's US dollars—over the next 20 years on engine programs alone), and are still facing [significant hurdles](http://www.reuters.com/article/uk-china-engine-idUSLNE89T00W20121030). Why do people feel that India would get significant results by spending just a few thousand crores?

In any case, the Kaveri isn't a complete write off. A naval derivative, the [Kaveri Marine Gas Turbine](http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/built-for-air-force-kaveri-engine-chosen-by-navy-109090800089_1.html) may end up powering Indian Navy vessels. It is also under consideration to [power an Indian UAV](http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/now-kaveri-engine-to-power-indigenous-uav-115073001650_1.html). 

There are civilian spin-offs too. For example, Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL) [now uses](http://www.drdo.gov.in/drdo/English/DRDO_BROCHURE_2015.pdf) the investment casting technology developed by GTRE for manufacturing blades for gas turbines used in power generation.

**False Argument 5: In a globalised world, there is no point re-inventing the wheel. The IAF should simply dump it and buy the Gripen/F-16/MiG-35**

What is true for cell phones or cars isn’t true for military equipment. In the long run, in peace and in war, the IAF would be best served by fielding fighters designed and built in India. That's the only way it will equip itself with a large fleet on a (relatively) small budget. There are other advantages to developing the technology in-house: less dependence on foreign suppliers, leading to increased strategic independence. Creation of a stronger local economy and industrial ecosystem. The freedom to tinker with the design and optimise it to suit local requirements without running afoul of IP agreements with the OEM. Spin-offs in the civilian world. And so on and so forth. And if going indigenous is indeed the way forward, then the IAF will have to live with fielding under-performing/problematic designs at the beginning. It will have to make peace with the fact that aerospace R&D is a slow, painful process that is fraught with risk.

That's how practically everyone else did it. The Chinese did not seek out the latest and greatest toy because their initial designs (Q-5, JH-7, J-8, J-10) failed to match up to what the US, Japan, and India fielded. If the J-10B and J-20 are flying today, it is only because the PLAAF and PLAN flew inferior aircraft for decades while their industrial capabilities matured. As it is, the Tejas program's achievements have been quite impressive: the country has developed a fourth-generation fighter that is as good as the Gripen-C from scratch. It uses more home-grown technology than the Gripen does; including such critical subsystems like the digital FBW, the composite airframe, a large portion of the avionics, etc. Many of these have been applied to the IAF's legacy aircraft as upgrade packages. To throw it all away because of a handful of challenges here and there or because Lockheed or Boeing are offering to transfer their manufacturing lines to India would be incredibly, utterly stupid. If the Tejas is cancelled, we will have a repeat of the same thirty-year saga the next time India tries to build her own fighter.

Policy/Economy,Indian government borrows money at 4-6% higher interest rate than most of developed countries,"This is a bit technical topic so I have tried to simplify it with some approximations.

Governments across the world need to borrow money to manage their day to day finances. These are in form of bonds. The money borrowed is given by investors (such as banks, worldwide specialist funds, other country's central banks) which demand a certain interest rate to lend money to a government. Another dimension is maturity of loan (does government want 1 yr loan, 2 yr loan, 5 yr loan, 10 yr loan, 20, 30 yr loan).

One of the most popular series is to compare interest rate on a 10 yr loan paid by various countries. While India has a yield (read as interest rate for simplification) of 6.4% for 10 yr bond, countries like Switzerland, Germany, France, Japan have a negative interest rate. This means investors are 'okay' losing money for holding money in these countries. Imagine taking a home loan and paying negative interest rate on it.

What is the basis for this comment?

>Some developments have taken place after the 14th Finance Commission’s (FC) recommendations. Cesses and surcharge have increased significantly, even after GST. The States felt that they were being short-changed by the way the Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) were restructured, increasing the share that the State government has to put in and then the way the GST is being administered. The general debate earlier was about the Bihar model competing with the Gujarat model and different States’ models of development competing with each other.

>Now, suddenly the “one nation, one policy” sentiment is overtaking the other models. And the Planning Commission, which was a forum for States, is also not there now.

>Due to this institutional vacuum, Ministries are directly dealing with CSS. So, the spirit of discussion and dialogue is being replaced by diktats by various Ministries. Some say that there is no dialogue, which is untypical of cooperative federalism.

You’ve said that States are now forced to share more from their own resources in CSS. After your own 14th FC recommendations, the impression was that the Centre was devolving more to the States as it went up from 32% to 42%.

>As my co-author G.R. Reddy will explain, the comparison is not between 32% and 42%; what was 39% became 42%, because of the way the computations differed. This increase was more than offset by the other actions on cesses and surcharges and CSS. So there has been virtually no advantage for the States

>G.R. Reddy: The 14th FC considered the entire revenue account. Unlike the previous FCs, it considered even the Plan revenue account. As a result, some of the Plan transfers were subsumed under tax devolution.

>The difference between 14th FC and others is that the former did away with sector specific grants that amount to 4-5% of the total devolution. If you take these two together, the actual devolution would have been 39% earlier and that became 42%. Even this 3% increase is not very visible because it has been more than neutralised by the Centre. The reality is that it has increased the matching contribution of the States in CSS and done away with 6000 model schools started in 2011; half way through, in 2015-16, it took a decision to terminate the entire scheme of model schools.

>The entire burden of running schools and meeting expenditure – both capital and operational expenditure, has now fallen on the States.

>They then restructured 66 CSS into 22 umbrella schemes. So there is no change in the number of CSS schemes. All components have remained the same.

Why didn’t States raise the issue?

>We have done so before the 15Th FC… and communicated to the Centre that what they had done was not correct.

>Immediately after the 14th FC recommendations were accepted, the Hon Prime Minister wrote to us saying ‘now that the States are flush with funds…’, We wrote back saying there is absolutely no increase in the flow of funds to the States, but only a change in the composition of transfers in favour of untied transfers. Now what has happened is there has been a qualitative change in the transfers to States – we are getting more money through untied transfers.

>The total transfers as a percentage of gross revenues to the States from the Centre has remained at the same level – 49%.

Aren’t untied transfers desirable? It frees States to use funds for whatever purpose they deem fit…

>Whatever additional money to have come through untied transfers is now tied up towards meeting the additional commitment.

>In the revised pattern of CSS, you have to put in more money.

>You have made a commitment, you can’t ‘uncommit’. But they have changed the pattern. Whatever untied funds you have got, you put in those schemes.

>For example, in 2014, Telangana’s contribution to the CSS was around ₹2,000 crore. In 2015-16, because of the change in funding patterns, it has gone up to ₹3,500 crore. So there is additional commitment on the part of the States.

>There is further commitment for States, because of termination of some CSS – the model schools scheme is an example. Another is BRGF – backward regions grant fund - for Telangana State, 9 of the then 10 districts were under the BRGF. They substantially reduced allocations under women and child welfare also.

>There is a view that there are just too many CSS – money is not efficiently used

>The other concern with CSS is that the money is too thinly spread across schemes. For example, if you take education or health, States are spending close to 80%. The Centre is supplementing the States up to only 20%, which does not make much difference. That too comes with conditionalities, submission of uses, visits of Central teams, delays in release of funds. As a result of these procedures, we are unable to fully utilise the Centre’s allocations. I don’t think any State has used the funds from Centre entirely.

So the solution is to offer funds and allow States a free hand?

>The Commission under Dr. Reddy recommended the same – that the number of CSS should be restricted to some nationally identified priorities.

>Dr. Y.V. Reddy: Basic issue is that Finance Commission is one mechanism which essentially is meant for sharing of taxes and that is based on a formula. 80-90% of transfers to States has always been on tax devolution. In tax devolution, there are no conditions, how much weight you give for population, which census’ population and other consideration namely as fiscal capacity. The only question there is what weight you give. If you give weight equally for efficiency and equity, they cancel out, in some sense.

You mentioned institutional vacuum. Do you think NITI Aayog has not been able to step up to the plate?

>There were some deficiencies in the way the Planning Commission functioned. There was an impression given to the States that they had to go to the Commission as a supplicant but not for discussion. That was its weakness which had to be corrected. In the correction process, that bad habit was got rid of but there was no new system. There is no forum now. Each Ministry has become an authority unto itself and is able to dictate terms to the States.

Is it deliberate that the Aayog does not have power or did it evolve thus?

>That is a question mark. Whether it was by design or by default, the result is that the individual Ministries are indicating to the States, which means there is no coherent and comprehensive view of the States in the process.

There is a view that some of the terms of reference of the 15th FC may not stand the test of constitutional validity. What’s your view?

>There are 3-4 issues. It is true that it generated unprecedented reaction. Never before for an FC have a number of CMs got together and protested. Also, some scholars questioned the constitutional validity of some Terms of Reference – for example, whether there is need for revenue deficit.

>The constitution provides for it and each FC needs to decide on this. Third, the 15th FC has been asked to review the 14th FC. It is a continuing process. Above all, the Commission has been asked to make recommendations keeping in view some performance indicators and that States should conform to certain policy parameters, which reflected the existing policy of the Centre.

>The way the FC is structured, it is not supposed to be an instrument of the central government’s priorities of the day. So it has been questioned on several grounds.

>Most of the considerations mentioned in the ToR are not necessarily binding on the FC. The Commission can choose to or choose not to take these into account. But it needs courage and vision for the Commission to do so – we are hoping that will be there.

What’s your view on the controversy over the base date of population census in the 15th FC?

>The whole question is whether it is a correct thing or not. It is difficult to defend outdated population as the basis. Because the FC is supposed to take into account the needs of the State for the period. How can 1971 population determine the needs of the State in 2021? It was undertaken on the grounds that States should not be penalised. But what about States that have taken action on family planning after 1971? They don’t get anything. It should be a continuing incentive, right?

>This time, they prescribed 2011 population. That is also not valid. The FC recommendations are from 2020. So you should have estimated population of the States for the period 2020-2025. Ideally, there should be no stipulation of a date for population and should be left to the FC but if at all, one should have the population relevant for the period.

Isn’t GST a good example of cooperative fiscal federalism?

>It is an extraordinary institution and is commendable. It did not come into existence overnight. It started as an informal committee in the Finance Ministry and has evolved. In the implementation, there has been dissatisfaction expressed. The fact that the Centre has a veto increases its influence. But that is part of the game. Concerns may be there in the way it is working. But as an institutional set up, it is extraordinarily good. It is a good example of collaboration and cooperation in an institution between the Union and the States.

Can this be replicated in other areas?

>Exactly. This is on the revenue side. On the expenditure side, fiscal transfers outside the FC, it can be brought under some inter-State council. That was the recommendation of the 14th FC.

>The GST Council may not be replicated but is a good approach to build on. On the expenditure side, it is a different type of collaboration, compared to the revenue side.

Is that a recommendation that the 15th FC can give?

>Yes. The transfers to the States from the Centre can take FC and non-FC routes. The 14th FC gave recommendations on how to structure the non-FC transfers. It’s only in the ambit of advice.

>There are three approaches: virtually abolish the Commission by making a constitutional amendment and say this will be the percentage; the second is to have a continuous FC, a GST Council type of mechanism but the FC gets subsumed in this; the third is to have the FC and a design of new institutional arrangements which will be more technical, more political and more consensus-based, as recommended by the 14th FC.

>All this is provoked partly because of the GST Council which has been positive and partly because of the institutional vacuum — both these are pushing us to find new institutional mechanisms.

Pleasantly surprised at the functioning of the GST Council. It comprises people with varying vote bank compulsions.

>The consensus has been the result of number of years of effort. Consultative process has been going on for the last 10-15 years. States also are convinced that it is a win-win situation, for the sake of tax harmonisation across the country, they felt it was better. And there was also the feeling that GST is a better form of tax, leading to better compliance. It builds up a value chain. Initially, there was some apprehension on part of manufacturing States that they may lose out this being a destination tax. So we have put in place a 2 year statutory mechanism that they will be compensated for a period of 5 years. The states have yielded lot more space than the Centre. For States, VAT constituted about 60% of their old tax revenue. They have conceded 50% of their fiscal space to the Centre, whereas the space conceded by the Centre is only 30%. They still get customs duty, income tax etc. In the working, there is still a trust deficit because the voting pattern is fully loaded in favour of the Centre, which has almost a veto power.

>Then, the way the GST is administered is also raising apprehensions in the minds of the people that they are not being treated fairly by the Centre. Like delays in apportionment of IGST, delays in payment of compensation cess, collecting more compensation cess than required. Best thing to do is to reduce compensation cess correspondingly that they are not doing. So there is surplus compensation cess lying with the Centre to be distributed after 5 years. It is for the Centre to set the record straight and remove this trust deficit.

On the special category status for Andhra Pradesh, what was the stand that you took in the 14th FC?

>Special category status is not under the jurisdiction of any FC. In my book, I have explained the Centre’s version of the relationship between 14th FC recommendation and the special category.

>If you want the simple truth, 14th FC did not make any recommendation on inclusion or exclusion of special category. The issue of according special category status and assurance by the PM was given months before the 14th FC could give recommendations.

>But the government has its own explanation as to why it interprets the recommendations of 14th FC with regard to special category status. I have given that in the book. It is for the reader to decide why and how these are related.

Cess is becoming a monster in the administrative system. With GST we assumed that cess won’t any longer be a part of the system. But with Kerala, we have a disaster cess. Isn’t the purpose of a reform lost with such acts?

>There is a calamity fund and the Centre is expected to come to the assistance of states when such things happen and there is always a burden sharing, you can’t anticipate this. Now the recourse to cess for such things is unusual.

Isnt this a step away from cooperative fiscal federalism? The Council is telling one state that funds needed for rebuilding after a disaster are to be generated from within that State...

>That is why some of them are dissenting calling it coercive federalism. These are ‘innovations’ that some States are uncomfortable with.

You have Kerala at the upper end of the social development scale and Uttarakhand at the lower end; T.N., Gujarat and Maharashtra at the higher end of the economic development index with Odisha and Bihar at the other. How is it possible for any central body, including the FC to reconcile these differences?

>That is exactly the issue with regard to any federation. In any federation there are competing considerations. You have to build trust amongst yourselves so therefore there is no fixed formula. That’s how you operate the system.

>What is needed is for the Centre to be able to bring together the States and treat these inequalities or calamities as a national problem in which both Union and States participate. Problem now is that whenever a State opposes the Centre it is accused of being anti-national. Being anti-union is not anti-national.

>There are 3 levels of debate – State interest, Union interest, national interest. To build a national consensus, the Union and States must be together. If the States get the feeling that the Union has abrogated to itself the sole authority of national interest, the States resent it. That is the essence of the matter.

How much is this because of a strong leader at the top?

>You should go back to Constituent Assembly debates. Dr Ambedkar when introducing the draft constitution, discusses the merits and demerits of parliamentary and presidential form of government and says why parliamentary system is important for India. He says that India is essentially undemocratic and therefore emphasises on continuous accountability. He says continuous accountability is more important than stability. That was the deliberate choice on this type of issue.

In 14th FC, you recommended forest cover as a determinant. In the five years that have lapsed, have you studied how that recommendation has helped India’s environment cause?

>No. But it’s an interesting area where we have to see the impact of the recommendation. But the logic is simple – forest cover. The state govt is contributing to environment at a cost to itself. It cannot use the resource but has to maintain it. So you have to provide for it. The basic principle is externalities. The state is contributing at its own cost – it does not gain anything. It incurs cost to maintain the forest.

Some users pointed that there is no good journalism. But that's not right. There is a good journalism but we have to find it. I am creating these lists to help ourselves. As a conscious and educated citizens we have to be careful as much as we can. Sometime you can find a good article in the bad list and a poor article in the good list. Above lists are not strictly implying but providing a general idea for us to be careful.

Policy/Economy,The identity crisis of Middle India,"It is often said of India’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, that he was the last Englishman to rule India. The saying carries some element of truth to it. Nehru may have been born in Allahabad, but his heart lay in the Shires and Oxbridge. This showed through in his language, cultural sensibilities, and overall, the parliamentary democracy that he guided us towards. He was a towering intellect, but unlike his contemporaries who were by and large bilingual intellectuals, his writings were mainly in English. He could give a speech in Hindi, but his knowledge of the tongue ended there. His sensibilities were English and it is to his credit that being so English and upper class as he was, he could mingle with just about anyone from the classes or the masses in a country as diverse as India.

One of Nehru’s primary concerns at Independence was the building of a national identity. India, under the British, was a loose confederation of states that recognized the paramountcy of the British and its people subscribed to only a vague sense of ‘Indian-ness’ that was never formally defined. Nor was such a definition even required. The Tamil in the far south was as unconcerned with the Punjabi in the far north, as was the Bengali with the Gujarati. As far as the common man was concerned, they mainly subscribed to more or less the same set of cultural values. There really was no concept of a political union called India. Indeed, the idea of a country called India, was born with independence and the dissolution of the British raj. However, the dissolution of the British Raj also brought with it partition and all its communal horrors. The lack of a common identity between the Hindu and the Muslim tore once harmonious communities apart. Nehru and his contemporaries realized that the fabric that held this nation together was frayed at the edges and would soon tear apart. It was of utmost importance, therefore, to cultivate a common identity of Indian-ness, and suppress any alternate cultural or regional identity.

We have all been part of this identity formation, whether it took the form of singing the national anthem every morning at school, or by learning the names of various and far flung rivers of the nation. And by and large, we have succeeded. A Tamilian today cheers for “Enga thalai Dhoni”, a man from Ranchi, Jharkhand with as much fervor as the Punjabi, the Bengali or the Gujarati. A common identity has been built and there is little talk of separatism in the Indian heartland. What separatism exists has literally been pushed to the fringes of the nation and is on the verge of fizzling out itself. The political unification of India has been a success.

Culturally though, we remain as diverse as ever, and a unified identity is something that is neither attainable nor desirable. In many areas of India, language remains a prickly subject and it is quite common to hear diatribes against linguistic minorities and those who do not speak the language native to the area they stay in. However, even this problem of communication has been resolved by that great gift of Empire, the English language. If two people from any of the country’s opposite extremes were to converse, they would use the English language to great effect. Indeed, this has even resulted in an amalgamated language called ‘Inglish’ which has created a cultural identity and linguistic space of its own.

Socially too, we are as diverse and it must be said, as divided as ever. Perhaps more so in the present than at any time in the past, near or ancient. India has always had a divided society. The caste system effectively divides us into haves and have-nots, where the have-nots outnumber the haves by a large sum. The have-nots, by virtue of their numbers are at the bottom of the pyramid, and the haves are right on top. This caste based division of society is often reflected in the economic sphere as well. The upper castes are in most cases, very well off. The lower castes tend to be among the poorer and more downtrodden sections of the society. Consequently the aspirations of the haves are vastly different from the aspirations of those at the lower half of the pyramid. This social pyramid has been the template for every society since the beginning of time. The upper classes, the middle classes and the lower classes are at various times dominant separately, but their composition remains pretty much the same. When the aspirations of one of these classes are not met, a society will experience upheaval. In the case of the lower classes, it is revolution. For the others, this upheaval takes the form of a flight to greener pastures. It is this upheaval that India is facing today.

The Indian state in the past sixty years has done a decent, though by no means complete, job of providing for the basic (and here I must stress on the word basic) aspirations of the lower rungs of the pyramid. The Roti, Kapada aur Makaan has been taken care of for many Indians. Food security was achieved quite a while ago, while our housing situation too has not been too bad. Again, I must remind the reader that there is much to be done, but there has been a good deal of coverage in this area. In the case of the better off citizen of this nation, the Roti, Kapada aur Makaan has always been taken care of. It is something else that he aspires too. These aspirations may take the form of entertainment, social standing, a certain lifestyle or even the choice of clothing. It is a matter of debate as to whether these aspirations have been fulfilled or not. Certainly, the cities of India hold all the ingredients to provide for these aspirations. And yet, it is seen that they do not and the urban youth have flocked to greener pastures abroad like migratory wildebeest. The logical conclusion in this case is that the aspirations of the urban youth have changed and these aspirations are something that Indian society cannot fulfill.

And so what are the aspirations of the urban, educated, elite of this nation? Certainly education and employment is readily available. Admission into an IIT/NIT, or barring that, an educational institute of similar standing is within their reach. A degree in Engineering guarantees every one of them gainful employment with a salary that can ensure a comfortable lifestyle. Some of them go in for a post graduate degree or diploma in management or business administration. A resume containing all this can lead to a very comfortable lifestyle with excellent prospects for any young Indian with an eye on his future. And yet, it is not sufficient to ensure that he or she does not take flight to greener pastures? What then, are the greener pastures that they aspire to?

Everyone has heard of the brain drain of the 70’s and 80’s. Educated Indians fled abroad in huge numbers, stymied by the lack of opportunities in this land. It was a great loss yes, but one could understand why they left. India in those days was in a socialist paroxysm. The license-quota-permit Raj that Nehru set up stifled creativity and business enterprise. Jobs were hard to come by in an economy with a ‘Hindu-rate-of-growth’ and as a result doctors, engineers and scientists fled this country for the US, helping to build societies there. Today however, the nation is better poised to provide employment and opportunities to its engineers and doctors. And yet, they continue to leave in droves. What then, are the opportunities that they are looking for?

Nehru tried hard to build a common identity for this nation. Today, nearly fifty years after his death, it is hard to say if he has succeeded or not. There is a political and cultural union called India. There is also a growing population of youth that hardly even identifies itself with this nation and its people and culture anymore. They identify themselves with the West. And it is in search of this identity, that they surge westwards in increasing numbers every year.

When I asked why they wished to leave this nation, I received many replies.. Some are insightful, some well thought out, and some are purely cynical and selfish, though unbeknownst to the person concerned.

One worshipper of the Western way of rational thought spoke in raptures about their technological and industrial prowess and glowingly described their plans to build a magnetically levitated high speed rail system. He noted that his own nation that had fed, housed and educated him for twenty five years was a “backward shithole that did not invent anything of note”, thus conveniently discarding the fact that it took the United States a hundred years to reach where it is now, while India is still suffering from its birth pangs.

A young lady of my acquaintance described India as a selfish, repressed society of bullies who could not be counted upon to elect a capable Prime Minister. She was “sick of the way we use age old methods that cannot be integrated into modern society, Must it be taught to even respect equally?”. She was right, to an extent. But it is doubtful if she would ever find a society that respects equally, where bullying is not tolerated and is not parochial and narrow minded in some sense. It also took all of my self control to keep from reminding her that Donald Trump has been elected to the most powerful office in the world.

The real reason, one that they are loathe to acknowledge, is that they no longer identify with the people around them anymore. Indeed, the vast majority of Indians are invisible to them and when they do make an appearance in their lives, they are disgusted and feel alienated. They would rather not acknowledge the presence of those whose aspirations are to merely survive, than to sit in a bar the whole day and drink beer and discuss the latest happenings in International politics. Fed on a relentless diet of Americana, they do not identify with Indian events, Indian characters, Indian food, drink or even other Indians anymore. The television shows they watch are American. The food that they eat is American. The books they read are American. The language they are most comfortable with is American. The news channels they are most familiar with show local American news. Indeed, they would know more about the political system of the USA than of their own nation.  The latest agendas of the latest Senatorial candidates would be on their fingertips. What would not be on their minds, is the names of their MP’s and MLA’s back home.

One of the most absurd things I have heard of in recent times is the news that a socialist has been elected to the Seattle city council. That a socialist has been elected in the USA itself is absurd enough. But what makes the news even more absurd is the fact that the candidate who campaigned on a socialist platform was an Indian who was raised in India, was educated in India, was in all likelihood a beneficiary of all the post liberalization reforms of the Government of India. Like everyone else in her generation, she would have been the first to demand reforms and the lifting of India’s socialist policies and yet, when she emigrated to the US, rediscovered the socialist in herself, because she could not bear to see the suffering of the American masses under the yoke of capitalism. It reeks of hypocrisy. Would she do the same thing in India? No. In India, the very same candidate would have triumphantly pointed to the benefits of our liberalization and campaigned for a right wing party, merely because the reforms have benefitted her tiny group of elites who reside on the top of the pyramid at the expense of those at the bottom. But of course, they do not even exist for her. Instead, she chose to fight for the American’s Roti, Kapada, aur Makaan, because – “ It is easier to convince 300 million literate people to vote for you, than to convince 1 billion illiterate people, never mind that they are your own people.”. There is a word to describe such people. It is ‘mercenary’. But then, what can you expect of a people who would rather celebrate Halloween to Holi?

It is easier to convince three hundred million literates to vote for you. It is far more difficult for these people to convince the one billion Indians who are their countrymen to vote for them because they do not even speak their language. Indeed, they do not even make an effort to learn their own mothertongue and identify with the rest of their society. This laziness to push themselves and achieve something points to a deeper malaise in our psyche. In other words, this generation of Indians has ‘Aspirations, but no Ambitions’. They feel apart from the world around them and would rather run away to the West than do anything about the very society that gave birth to them, but cannot satisfy their outsize American aspirations. And why would they not? They are Americans in all but name.

**TL;DR - Our urban youth emigrate because they are culturally American and do not even identify themselves as Indian anymore.**"

---
##Summary

This policy is easily the biggest change to the education system since the old policy came in. It is in many ways, entirely unrecognisable, while in many other ways, simply formalising what was informally already done.

The first and biggest change, is that primary education, from ages 3-6, is now a formal part of school education, and public school must offer this. The second change, what goes hand in hand, is the abolishing of the 10+2 system. In many ways, the 10+2 system completely ignored the way a student's mind developed, and thus made for a poor learning system. The new system is 5+3+3+4. These stages are as follows:

- 5 years of the Foundational Stage: 3 years of pre-primary school and Grades 1, 2.

- 3 years of the Preparatory (or Latter Primary) Stage: Grades 3, 4, 5.

- 3 years of the Middle (or Upper Primary) Stage: Grades 6, 7, 8.

- 4 years of the High (or Secondary) Stage: Grades 9, 10, 11, 12.

The new Foundational stage, is supposedly meant to be ""age fluid"". Your age does not matter, as long as you are within the age group 3-8. The Policy recommends that during the foundation stage there should be no textbook based education, and instead play based and activity based education. It also emphasises on introducing a variety of new ""stimuli"" to force children's brains to develop in a holistic manner. These stimuli include : music (classical or modern, both singing and listening), art (regional, national, sketching, etc.), literature (folk tales, literature from the region, and national quality authors, both modern and classical). This is a massive departure from the present system, and the new emphasis on arts, is excellent. To add to this, a new bilingual policy is introduced. Students who learn languages are shown to have much better cognitive abilities than those don't so the new system makes all students learn 2 languages right from the start. One of these has to be the mother tongue, in order to preserve it. The other language may vary by region and requirements. The three language policy remains, and will be better enforced. The final changes to the primary education, is the integration of ""anganwadis"" into schools, and shifting them from primarily health workers, to full scale trained teachers, satisfying the needs of the students. The NEP requires the full development of people-skills, through a variety of things like weekly assemblies and daily show-and-tells. This improves the speaking ability, something that IMO Indian students have historically been terrible at. New extras include group reading of stories, learning morality and ethics (along with a proper framework), puzzle solving of various types, etc. to make sure a child has a significantly better development. Students who fall behind are not left out, instead the teachers are required to identify and help them, as studies suggest that students who fall back early almost never recover.

The next ""Preparatory stage"" lays emphasis on shifting from a more informal style in the Foundation stage, to a more formal textbook oriented education, in the Middle stage. It is a bridge stage. Please not that the policy emphasises that any and all technical education *must* take place in the native language (mother tongue) first. This is because students who learn in their mother tongue have a noticeable advantage over those who learn in say English. The policy also has a very good write-up on why the emphasis on English has hurt India a lot. The preparatory stage also keeps this focus on arts, and expects students to fully develop other skills beyond the ""textbook education"". The policy also demands the abolishing of the so called ""co-curricular activities"" instead integrating them into the core curriculum. This makes things like PE, yoga, art, music, a core part of the education. It also requires that every student specialise in at least one of these subjects. Another new concept here is the selection of the best students to help the worst students. The best students are selected by the teacher, and then become part of a sort of ""national training system"".

The third stage is the ""Middle Stage"". By this time, the student's mind would have developed enough. It is now time to start the fully formal education. Subjects start splitting from generic versions into more detailed subjects (like science -&gt; physics + chemistry + biology). Students at this point will slowly start to also learn technical subjects in English. The idea is that students will be able to think in their mother tongue (which has a lot of advantages), while being able to understand and present ideas in English.

The fourth, and final stage is the ""High Stage"". At this point, students have developed a lot. Their mind now starts thinking in ""the bigger picture"" mode, and they can start planning for the rest of their life. In order to support this, students are now allowed to freely select courses and specialise. They are still required to understand and complete art courses, as this is paramount to their abilities, regardless of the final courses they choose.

Some important courses that come over the 12 years include : course on ethics and morality, Indian languages and their history and regional literature.

The next major changes come to the school management system. Schools can now form ""complexes"". A complex is comprised of nearby schools, such that each complex as a whole offers all of the above stages. Complexes are then given funds and other resources, like teachers. These resources may then be split up among the schools as necessary. This is important, because some types of teachers are relatively rare, and thus it provides optimal utilisation of resources. Sometimes other resources like libraries may also be shared. The exact details of what is shared will vary depending of the schools and their locality (population density, and ""backwardness"" of the population).

Schools also get a new level of autonomy, that was previously missing. Teachers are allowed to be the final deciders on the courses, and how they will be taught.

In order to improve attendance, the schools will do a number of things. Depending on the area, buses may be provided. Roads will be redone, so that transport is easier. Older students will be provided with free bicycles. The mid day meals will also be extended to offer basic breakfast to students. Adequate and safe infrastructure, including working toilets, clean drinking water, clean and attractive spaces conducive to learning, electricity, computing devices, and internet, will be important to provide to all schools.

To reduce inequality is a primary goal of the new policy. In order to do this, each school complex will have committee overseeing the demographics, and why students aren't attending. Specific groups called out include Muslims (for unwillingness to attend), and women in general. The policy requires that people of all castes and religions be integrated into the schools. The teachers are also required to emphasise on equality, by preventing acts that discriminate (e.g. not allowing SC/STs to sit with ""upper caste students"", etc.). The schools are required to join with the community in eradicating inequality. They are required to talk with parents and try and change their behaviour. This could be the groundwork to eliminating the reservation system. The policy sets the target of 2030, by which the majority of the students will be ""equalised"", not by pulling down the richer and higher caste, but by pulling up the poorer and downtrodden. Special Education Zones will be set up in disadvantaged regions across the country. The Central government will support extra investment and per-child expenditure in the ratio of 2:1 for each rupee spent by the State in these Zones. A special National Fund will be created specifically for providing scholarships and developing resources and facilities for students from Under Represented Groups.

The next set of changes are aimed at teachers. The primary aims are to improve teacher pay, and status in society. It recognises that teachers are already heavily burdened with a lot of work, so no government work may be offloaded onto teachers. They are also educated better, and stricter standards are set. Teachers are required to ""re-educate"" themselves by joining workshops, and the vertical mobility of teacher is to be improved. Teacher education will gradually be moved into multidisciplinary colleges and universities. By 2030, the minimum degree qualification for teaching will be a four-year liberal integrated B.Ed. degree that teaches a range of knowledge content and pedagogy.
Developmental opportunities, in the form of local, State, national, and international teaching and subject workshops, as well as online teacher development modules, will be available to all teachers. Substandard stand-alone Teacher Education Institutions (TEIs) across the country will be shut down as soon as possible. New teachers will have to register with an authority, and then will be quickly shifted into a school complex, for integration with the schools as necessary.

The next major changes comes to the testing system. The new system will be run by the National Testing Agency (which was newly set up in 2017 for entrance exams). They will be conducting the tests, and the new tests will be more like aptitude tests.  They will de-emphasise rote learning, instead encouraging an understanding of the subject. The policy claims that by 2020, all schools will have internet connected computers. It thus pushes for some degree of digitisation, by allowing for continuous evaluation through computers. Board exams in 10th and 12th are no longer. Instead we have exams in 3rd, 5th and 8th, called Census exams. The idea is to reduce the importance of Board exams. Teachers will also be more involved in the governance of schools and school complexes.

This policy also paves the way for better recognition of ""top talent"" students. For e.g. if a student is really good in Math, then they will be attending special summer schools to improve their performance. As already mentioned, top students are also required to tutor the students who are have a hard time coping. There is also a new emphasis on Olympiads. This should improve India's ranks in international competitions.

The RTE act sees some changes. It is now extended to the full duration of school, from ages 3-18. The RTE act itself will have to be reviewed, as the policy notes.

As for private institutions, there has been some misinformation. Private institutions will have to undergo some changes to have a similar system, so that they too can reach out to all students. The main changes are how fees is regulated. Fees needs to be rationalised, and can't be arbitrarily high. Once set, fee increments must go inline with inflation and reasonable increases, as opposed to random increases. Schools are also now required by law to be non-profit, and must be verified regularly by submitting all of their financial details. Private schools are also prohibited from having the word ""public"" in their name. So be prepared to see a lot of name changes.

Schools will now also be accredited and regulated in a slightly more free manner. However, they are required to release all details to the public. A framework and guidelines for ensuring school safety and security of children will be developed, and will be made a part of the eligibility conditions for a school education institution for recognition and registration. Every principal and teacher will be made aware of the provisions of the relevant Acts, Rules, Regulations, etc. relating to child rights, and what constitutes their violation, by including a module in the teachers’/principals’ education/training programmes and refresher courses. Self-learning online programmes on child rights will be developed for the benefit of students, teachers, and parents. Credible mechanisms for students to report breaches of their rights, and for appropriate actions to be taken against perpetrators, will be developed and implemented, in collaboration with local police. The Adolescent Education Programme and National Population Education Programme will be integrated into the curriculum of schools in a phased manner. (please note that Adolescent Education Programme is not sex education).

Also, in addition to all this, alternative forms of schools like gurukulas, patashalas, and madrassas will be encouraged, as long as they follow a modernised syllabus and are fully transparent.

The first changes will be implemented by 2020, with most major changes being in place by 2022. The first benefits will be seen by 2025, and by 2030, we should have fully transitioned, with all benefits in place.

----
##Comparison With the Current System:

The existing system failed primarily in 2 ways: Languages were poorly integrated, and many schools did not even offer three languages, as the policy notes. Hindi speaking states and TN were the primary offenders. Now all students are required to learn languages as per the Three Language Formula. The other way the old system failed was in testing. NCF (2005) laid heavy focus on eliminating rote learning, and in introducing a system where discovery based education was encouraged. The 10th grade NCERT textbook for science is a testament to that. Yet the system failed, because tests only cared about how well a student could mug up and vomit arbitrary facts. The new policy does try to fix this, but how much will improve remains to be seen.

The other more minor ways in which it failed was the integration of ""extra curricular"" subjects. Many schools actually refused to teach these subjects, considering them a time waste. The new system makes them a core part of the education system, so there should be an improvement.

Please discuss, and if you have any doubts, feel free to ask.

##TL;DR:

1. Learning to learn

2. Mother tongue as primary language of learning

3. Focus on trilingual policy, with English no longer as primary language

4. Equality of all students

5. Arts, Sports, Music, literature, etc. are all now of primary importance, and each student has to specialise in one of these, in addition to courses of their choice

6. Digital Education

7. Freedom of choice in higher stage of education

8. Board exams removed in favour of more frequent ""census exams""

9. Testing now to focus on aptitude and understanding, with more frequent tests, a la CCE under CBSE

10. 10+2 eliminated in favour of 5+3+3+4, with full focus on primary (3-8 years) of education"

Policy/Economy,[AskIndia] Why do we have so much distrust of Businesses and Markets?,"Was listening to a talk from Kunal Shah (founder of Freecharge and Cred) and found quite a few insights about the attitude of Indians towards generating wealth through businesses.

A few things really stood out. For example -

1. India has a unique MRP system for products found nowhere else in the world. It gives us the illusion that we are charged fairly for our goods but it works very counter-intuitively against the poor.
Because the rich pay almost the same price as the poor. A richer neighbourhood should have richer prices than in a poorer neighbourhood.
The manufacturer has to price the MRP at a rate higher than he would in a competitive market because he needs to make sure he covers his cost or overruns due to dead or destroyed stock.

2. How we, as Indians, value money over time. We would not pay for quality which saves us time but we will gladly buy sub-quality goods if it saves us money.

3. We question and probe profit percentages of each private company but have no clue about the efficiency of government spending and yet we keep clamouring for more taxes.

4. Pre-1991, we were poor and ridden with Socialist policies which championed the poor and the farmers and we went bankrupt. But after 1991, when we allowed foreign money to come in, we saw a substantial rise in the standard of living and goods.
Yet, we are still calling restrictions on foreign capital in e-commerce and retail which is just perplexing.

5. We think the private companies are out to loot the people of India and we think Adani and Ambani are rich because of Modi but it is, in fact, the lack of competition and implementation of endless rules and licenses that allow Adani and Reliance to operate in any field with almost no competition.


I don't get it. Is this an education thing? Have we been taught capitalism incorrectly? The numbers are so clear yet we are still stuck in denial about having government involvement in the economy. So many people flock to capitalist economies from India yet why do we trust the government so much?

And before anyone says, yes I do think Healthcare, defense, law and order should be under government along with economic incentives for education and research but beyond that, you don't really need government."

Policy/Economy,[Rant] India’s BRUTAL tax for the rich,"To be honest, I feel this post applies to those who pay tax (regardless of which slab), I’m just putting stuff from my perspective.

There are no two ways to put it, India’s tax on the super rich is ridiculously high. I belong to that super rich community and while paying taxes is not an issue, the amount certainly is. Money doesn’t come easy and I’ve worked hard for it. Meanwhile the government just gives us a big middle finger and increases the taxes. 

Now tell me why would anyone want to live in a developing country with such high tax rates. Before any of you’ll hark on about patriotism and bullshit like that just think logically for a second. For the amount of tax (42.7%) paid here, you can easily shift to a country with lower tax rates. And with the kind of money people from my income category have I can see a lot of them leaving this country for good. 

The government is not incentivizing individuals to become wealthy. What benefits does being wealthy in India get you? Roads are shit, public infrastructure is lacking, incredibly high taxes for luxury items, the list goes on and on.... 
Instead they want to spend my money on statues, stupid ministries like AYUSH, scams, bailing out public sector companies and stuff like that.

Worse, so much money, which I GAVE as tax is being spent to appease the vote bank. Rich farmers are not taxed because the government is afraid to lose them. The individuals and companies who pay taxes (the 1%) have absolutely no say in policies because the government wants to use the money to appease the other (99%). (The figures are just examples). We are the source of that money. India is taking a turn to the socialist era, when taxes were even more exorbitant and India was a planned economy. I just wish the government would aggressively try to increase the tax base instead of strangling those who pay tax.

EDIT- I am NOT averse to paying high taxes in general. I already elaborated that in my comment below but in India, tax does not give benefits that other countries with similar tax rates give."
Policy/Economy,Sardar and Legacy [Spiritual Translation of Two Marathi Articles],"The credit for integrating almost all princely states, barring three, before 15 August 1947 undoubtedly goes to Sardar Patel. But he was of tired body and mind post-independence and post-Gandhi assassination.

It's one thing to like historic fables and another to consider them history. There are often efforts to sell these fables as history. But it's time to look for true history. Currently certain fables are sold as history. Some of them are: Sardar Patel was Hindutvavadi and subsequently anti-Muslim, if he was leading the country instead of Nehru then all of our problems (i.e. Pakistan and Jammu-Kashmir) would've been solved already. Due to wishes of masses, these misunderstandings are considered history. There's effort to sell these fables as history.

First let's tackle most lethel delusion. That is had Mahatma Gandhi not put his weight behind Pandit Nehru, then Sardar Patel would've been our first Prime Minister. A most liked fable in halls of Whatsapp university. Reality however, begs to differ. Pandit Nehru wasn't chosen as Prime Minister at the last minute. It had been going under consideration since 1929. At that time Purna Swaraj (Declaration of Independence of India) under consideration which was officially announced on 26 January 1930. It's leadership came easily under Nehru because he was 2nd most popular leader of Indian National Congress after Gandhi. Then there was a challenge of elections as per Government of India Act 1935. For that, there was no other option than to handover the party presidentship to Nehru. The popularity necessary to win the elections was with Gandhi and Nehru. Sardar Patel was main fundraiser and chairman of Congress' Central Parliamentary Board at that time. However it meant Nehru had bigger responsibility since as a President, he was the face of the party. That is the reason why in 1942 Gandhi declared him as successor. The whole party stood with him and so strong was the resolve that in 1946 - a year before independence - Maulana Abul Kalam Azad resigned presidentship for Nehru.


It's interesting to check the delusions of people who claim Sardar should've been the Prime Minister. After his release from prison in 1945, he was not in good health. He was struggling with diabetes and blood-pressure and his mind was gloomy because of family issues. He had severe heart attack on 4 March 1948, barely a month after Gandhi assassination. Even doctors had given up hopes. Sardar survived but it took a toll on his health. He had said that next news won't be of my sickness but of my death. He died in December 1950. He didn't live to see first general election in India. Nehru was 15 years younger to him. Sardar belonged to generation of Gandhi and Jinnah and three of them died shortly after independence. Sardar Patel's own words are enough to remove any doubt about his desire for Prime Ministership. ""Desire demands youth and health. We have none."" He even conceded that the crowd at Bombay rally had 'come for Jawahar, not for me'.

This should tell us how unrealistic it is to claim Sardar for PM.


Now let us talk about partition. Sardar Patel was one of the first people to agree to partition proposal by Mountbatten. Nehru accepted it later. Maulana Abul Kalam Azad on the other hand, staunchly opposed partition till the end. He was of the opinion that India shouldn't be divided. He himself had written it in his 'India Wins Freedom'. It might be politically incorrect to speak highly of Azad in current political climate. But it is documented history. Patel was first one to accept the truth that it isn't right to make Hindus suffer for dream of Undivided India. Nehru and Gandhi followed him to accept the bitter reality. So all three of them are equally 'responsible' for partition. It is  politically convenient to blame partition on Gandhi and Nehru. But it isn't reality. 

Finally, let's talk about his love for Hindutva. He had none as documented by many historians and journalists such as Narhar Kurundkar, Govindrao Talvalkar, Ramchandra Guha, Rafiq Zakaria, even American Vincent Sheean. He had major role in giving religious roles to Indian Muslims. Minority Institues also have special rights thanks to Patel. He never opposed leadership of Khan Abdul Gafar Khan in Northwest region, nor did he oppose Shaikh Abdulla in Kashmir. Not just that, but he never felt to limit rights of Indian Muslims after creation of Pakistan. It is also history that he had admonished Uttar Pradesh's then Chief Minister  Govind Vallabh Pant after idols of Rama were placed in Babri Masjid in 1949. He was of the opinion of resolving the matter through talks. There's also no example of Patel giving different treatment to Hindu and Muslim rulers of Princely states. Hindu Maharaja of Travancore intended to stay independent. So there's no reason to claim that Patel's politics was motivated by religion.  Infact, his outlook towards RSS changed after Gandhi Assassination. Even though the ties between RSS and Gandhi Assassinations were never proved, he was of the opinion to ban it along with Hindu Mahasabha. 

----

A reader called me to accuse that ""your favourite JRD had said, if Sardar Patel had become the Prime Minister, India would have followed a different path and we could have been in a better economy than we have today"". I spoke with him and by the end of the call he had change of heart. Why? Let's see.

History tells us that Gandhi's economic policies were opposed by Nehru and Patel and two of them also had difference of opinion about it. Nehru's economic policies had layer of naive socialism. Which gave birth to state-owned enterprises. It spread so much that goverment was making wristwatches. Nationalization was core of his economic policies. It's as if he hated the idea of profit. 

JRD and Nehru had disagreement about this point. JRD was of the opinion that it's not government's job to run airline company. It should be noted that JRD's favourite child, Air India was nationalized by Nehru. Patel agreed with JRD on opinion that businesses should be left to businessmen. JRD's opinion was in this context, ""if Sardar Patel was a younger mand and had become the Prime Minister, India would have followed a different path and we could have been in a better economy than we have today""

Now the caller didn't take into account Patel's health. Nor did JRD speak about Nehru's popularity and politics. His only focus for comparison was economy.

Now let's come to present. Nehru's economic policies were criticised by many political parties, including the one currently in power. The criticism includes inefficieny, irresponsibilty, unnecessary hirings and expenses etc. 

Narasimha Rao took stand against this love for state-owned enterprises. Him and Manmohan Singh opned the doors for economic liberalization. Rao was throughly Congressman. But he didn't hesitate to throw policies of his predecessor in the can. Atal Bihari's government came close to Rao's. He pushed privatization and sold state enterprises operating at loss. As a member of BJP he had right to can Nehru. 

Now Vaypayee's party came to power in 2014. This part is business-friendly and progressive. So it was a given that PSU's will get evem more freedom. Sins of Congress had resulted in loss in banks, air india, and other state enterprises. The BJP's admiration for Patel meant that even more economic improvements would be done. As a sign of their admiration, this goverment decided to build a monument for Patel. So far Congressis had ignored Patel so these people decied to build a statue so tall, you could not ignore it. That's how you pay tribute to your heros!

Around 3000 crores Rupees were spent for this glorious monument. Who paid for it? The caller didn't know. 

So this is the list of generous people who contributed to this monument, in Rupees:

- Indian Oil - 900 Crores

- Oil and Natural Gas Commission - 500 Crores

- Bharat Petroleum - 450 Crores

- Hindustan Petroleum - 250 Crores

- Oil India - 250 Crores

- Gas Authority of India - 250 Crores

- Power Grid - 125 Crores

- Gujrat Mineral Development Corporation - 100 Crores

- Engineers India - 50 Crores

- Petronet India - 50 Crores

- Balmer Lawrie - 6 Crores

Does the list ring any bell? All of these are Government owned companies. Who were born because of Nehruvian economics and policies,  which was opposed by Sardar Patel. And his monument is now funded by the same companies.

And the money comes from Corporate Social Responsibility funds of these companies, even written down for preservation ofr arts and culture by some of them.

Who is preserving whose which legacy? Food for thought."
Policy/Economy,Vanakkam! Updates on the Aadhaar-social media linkage and encryption PIL before the Madras HC," 

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/0remvkhc48c31.png

As some of you may remember, the Madras High Court had permitted IFF to intervene in an ongoing public interest litigation regarding linking of Aadhaar with social media accounts. You can read more about why we decided to intervene in this case [**here**](https://internetfreedom.in/aadhaar-linking/). There was a hearing in the matter today, i.e. 24 July 2019, and IFF was represented by its legal team consisting of Suhrith Parthasarthy, Arun Mohan and Surasika, with our Executive Director, Apar Gupta also being present in person.  


### What is at stake?

This case is extremely important because the Hon’ble High Court is considering a wide remit of issues, and not just Aadhaar and social media linking.  These include encryption, intermediary liability and use of automated tools to take down illegal content.  


The outcome of this litigation could lead to a change in the product design of major social media platforms because law enforcement agencies want the Hon’ble High Court to direct these companies to devise a mechanism to trace the originator of a message. In this regard, a specific proposal has been made by Dr. V. Kamakoti who is a Professor at IIT Madras to include the phone number of the originator of a message whenever a message is forwarded.   


In its written submission to the Hon’ble High Court, IFF has emphasized that any restrictions on the use of social media platforms must be proportionate and they should arise from a deliberative and consultative process that takes into account the concerns of all stakeholders. We have highlighted how changing the product design of social media platforms to include the phone number of the originator of the message would undermine the freedom of speech of internet users. Anonymity is an important part of freedom of speech because otherwise, individuals would be too reluctant to discuss controversial subjects in the public domain. The right to anonymous speech is especially important for whistleblowers, abuse survivors, activists and others belonging to marginalized groups who may face harassment if their identity was disclosed.   


### What happened at today’s hearing?

Today, senior legal counsels appearing for WhatsApp and Facebook made extensive arguments on the central point of traceability. On our part, we filed and placed a substantive response which addresses a broad range of issues which have arisen including concerns regarding digital surveillance, encryption and content takedowns. During oral arguments, based on submissions made by the lawyers for social media platforms, the Hon’ble High Court expressed the view that it may even examine the existing level of compliance and legal vacuum under the IT (Intermediary Guidelines) Rules.   


Prof. Kamakoti’s technical inputs which formed part of the Government’s common report have been directed to be filed by the Hon’ble High Court. This promises to be interesting and we will respond to it. The next date of hearing in this case is 21 and 22 August 2019.

Policy/Economy,We really need to talk about Flairs.,"Hello /r/india  
  
Here are some clarifications on submission flairs, since we see a lot of mis-flaired posts from time to time.  
  
**[P] - Political**  
  
These are for political posts only. If a post involved any politician, political party or anything primarily related to politics, then it must be flaired as political  
  
**[NP] - Non-political**  
  
These are for discussions where you are confident there is no politics involved. You cannot flair a post that is primarily or tangentially related to politics with an NP tag.  
 
This is important because quite a few people use the filters we have on the sidebar to filter out political (or non-political) posts, and misflairing one as the other may irritate these users.  
  
**[R] - Reddiquette**  
  
When this flair is selected, Reddit's Reddiquette guidelines are enforced in the thread, along with certain other restrictions so as to have a slightly higher quality discussion.    
  
Jokes, puns and low effort comments will be removed in such threads.
  
This can be used for both political and non-political topics.  
  
**[ASK] - AskIndia**  
  
These are flairs for self-posts where the OP wants to ask the community a question. You cannot use this flair for link posts (because that makes no sense unless ToI or HT wants to ask /r/india a question).  
  
If the question is political in nature, then the thread must be flaired with P or R, not with AskIndia. This is to prevent filters from being breached.  
  
**Science & Technology** 

This flair is for topics with an explicit, mostly non-political science & technology bent to it. If it tangentially involves politics, it is fine to use this flair in place of [P].   
 
If Modi makes a comment about the ISRO, then it is a P thread.  
If the ISRO conducts some research that points to where state governments can improve with irrigation, and a politician comments on that, then it can be flaired with Science & Technology assuming the primary focus of the story isn't the politician's comment.  

**Policy & Economy**
  
These flairs work similarly. The main topic of the subject matter should be about policy or economy. The instant the focus shifts to politics, political parties, politicians, etc. the flair must be [P].  

**Business & Finance**  

These flairs are for articles, or self-post submissions with a non-political, business bent to them. If you want to know where to invest or if Ola Cabs decides to go public, then this is the flair for you.  
  
**Entertainment** 

Entertainment flair is exclusively for pop-culture links, submissions, and discussions. Examples under this flair include movie trailers, movie clips, comics, YouTube joke sketches and things along those lines.  
  
This flair cannot be used for some politician saying something absurd, funny or ridiculous. That constitutes an editorialization of the title on the part of the OP - since the OP insinuates that the subject matter is funny with the title (instead of letting the reader make up their mind).   
 
**Sports and Food** 

Sports & Food flairs are very self-explanatory  

**AMA**
  
AMA flairs are given to OPs who verify their identity with the mod team. In case they choose not to verify, they will get an **Unverified** flair.  
  
**In-Depth**

This flair must be used carefully.This flair *only* used when you need an In-depth discussion about the topic. Top comments must have a proper explanation/discussion about the top. Top comments must fulfil the word limit else the comment **will** get deleted by all mighty automod.

---  
PS - In the event of confusion, just go for Reddiquette.
  
Recommendations for new flairs may be made below.  "

Will immediately benefit 55 lakh workers.","Delhi government had tried to raise the minimum wage in 2017 but this had been taken to court by a number of associations of employers. High Court ordered against the hike in 2018, which was then appealed to Supreme Court. 

Delhi government then constituted a Minimum Wage Advisory Committee in November 2018 that finalised the wages. This amounts to Rs14,842/month for unskilled workers, which was submitted before the Supreme Court. The SC has now accepted Delhi Government's proposal. 

Comparison with some other states:

> Delhi ₹14842

> Haryana ₹8827

> UP ₹5750

> Gujarat ₹8190

> Maharashtra ₹10411

> [National Minimum Wage](https://thewire.in/labour/delhi-minimum-wake-hike) ₹ 4,576 (recommended, but not implemented ₹9,750) 

Of course Delhi has a higher cost of living, but I can't imagine other cities like Lucknow being 3 times cheaper. Therefore other state governments also need to look at their wages and revise them. 


> A Bench of Justices U.U. Lalit and Aniruddha Bose, in an order passed on October 14, permitted the Delhi government to bring into effect its draft proposal to revise minimum wages of unskilled labourers to ₹14,842, ₹16,341 for semi-skilled, ₹17,991 for skilled workers, ₹16,341 for non-matriculates, ₹17,991 for matriculates who are not graduates and ₹19,572 for graduates and above.

> In an affidavit filed on August 26 this year, the Delhi government said it has proposed the revised minimum wages taking into consideration “the average prices of food items and clothing component and other prescribed percentage of other components i.e. housing, light & fuel and education/social obligation”.

> https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/sc-allows-aap-govt-to-revise-minimum-wages/article29817076.ece

Policy/Economy,I read the Indian economic survey of 2018-9 so you didn't have to. Here are the highlights,"The biggest take-away was the direct attack on what the survey calls 'Anglo-Saxon economics'. Basically the concept of a general equilibrium theory. Instead it claims an economy is always within either a 'virtous cycle' or a 'vicious cycle'. 

A virtous cycle is characterised by rising investment, rising exports and rising savings. A vicious cycle is the inverse of that. 

The implication is that the government must intervene to steady the ship and any fantasy about 'rational actors' has to be abandoned.

The importance of higher savings cannot be underestimated accoring to the survey. It is only with high and rising savings that a country can **self-finance** high investments. Otherwise it must seek out foreign savings which gets translated into a high current account deficit which in turn makes it vulnerable during times of crises. 


They survey continually made mention of China and other fast-growing East Asian economies when making its case in countless graphs. It is clear what the chief inspiration is. 

Having very high savings naturally means having a correspondingly low domestic consumption. Thus, the only way to have fast growth when domestic consumption is subdued is through fast export growth. They survey made the case that because India still has a low share of world export market so there is plenty of scope to regain, regardless of trade tensions.

The survey made many other recommendations, of which judicial reform is one which caught my one, but the overriding theme of the survey was the call to abandon 'Anglo-Saxon economics', by which it meant general equilibrium theory. 

It'll be interesting to see if India truly makes a decisive economic policy break from the past as the language suggests."

Maybe this would be a lesson to future voters on whom not to vote.,"The way the leaders of this government are behaving, it is quite clear they have their heads buried so up in their own asses, they are totally oblivious of the ground realities. By the time people were yet to come out of Article 370 removal and Babri Masjid verdict, the government went ahead and implemented CAA. These guys are so good at creating new fires even before the embers of old flames have died down. They are not even giving time to the civil society to catch a breath.

Seriously attacking students and then condemning the attacks for namesake as if people wouldn't know who was behind these cowardly attacks. They have literally come to a conclusion that public is stupid, they will believe whatever our we spin it in the media. Gautam gambhir could have visited the university, hell nirmala sitharam is an Alumni of the same University. Is anyone even ready to take moral responsibility for these attacks?

I am pretty sure the party in power is almost ready to unleash their next half baked policy on our people and we will have to start protesting against that. Damn these are going to be 4 more very long years. By then the economy will be gone to dogs and if anybody questions anything there will always be the Pakistan rhetoric."

Policy/Economy,Why Russia in the Revolution of 1905 is analogous to India today,"Russia in 1905 was controlled by a very hated Tsar. He was in control only because he controlled the police and media. The courts were also controlled by him and thus no real justice was possible. 

Ring a bell? Read on. 

He ruled only for the vested big industry and land owners. They made policies and he simply was their puppet. Farmers were in distress and yes you also had farmer suicide but the Tsar didn't care because his sycophants told him he was the best Tsar ever and that the Economy and people were in great shape?

 Ding ding ding. 

Now in 1904 and 1905 began a series of mass democratic protests, all inorganic and a will of the people. Did the Tsar listen to them? No, he ignored them at best and at worst unleashed his army and police on unarmed masses murdering them by the 1,000's. 

You have made the connection haven't you. 

As this was all making the Tsar look bad, a group of fascists called the Black Hundreds, supported by the police came up. Like the RSS today they were a fascist mob who used the support of the state to silence dissenting voices by violence. Now go read about them and you will see that they mirror the RSS exactly. A summary from Wikipedia. 

>The Black Hundreds were also noted for extremism and incitement to pogroms, nationalistic Russocentric doctrines, different xenophobic beliefs, including anti-Ukrainian sentiment[4] and anti-semitism.

Replace russocentric with Hindutva and anti Ukrainian with Bangladesh and semitism with Islam and you have the exact same Ideology. 

Whenever a peaceful protest came up, these thugs will show up, murder the peace loving protestors while the police turned a blind eye. 

This is exactly the same as India under the Fascist thug Modi.  

I do hope that the people rise up and eventually overthrow him, restoring the rule of democracy we had before him."

EDIT 2 : i have come to the conclusion that most of you find the fact and reason that i voted for modi hard to swallow.Yes i admit that i made a mistake when i thought he is a Guju and he might have a business plan for our country.Turns out he did have business plans but only for Ambani.It was ignorance on my part when i thought the 2002 incidents were not Modi's fault.Most of his other policies were not well thought and anti Muslim.You can all blame me for voting for Modi and still be chin deep in shit or Give reasonable contentions that might help.i personally don't like the idea of voting for Rahul.But now if i had to,i would choose Rahul over Modi.But wouldn't it be better if congress chose a new PM candidate like Tharoor.I have a hunch that Modi will not be around for long.Aggressive sophomaniac piece of shits need not reply."

 February projected a 5.4 per cent real GDP growth for India in 2020. This too was a downgrade from 6.6 per cent earlier forecast. 

 “A number of governments and central banks have announced countervailing measures, including fiscal stimulus packages, policy rate cuts and regulatory forbearance; however, the effectiveness of policy easing will be blunted by measures to contain the outbreak, and policy space is constrained for some sovereigns,” 

 Moody’s said oil price shock adds to growth and fiscal pressures for exposed sovereigns. “A period of lower oil prices will further weigh on the economic and fiscal fundamentals of oil exporters, while mitigating the trade shock for importers.”

**#Brexit Update**

This isn’t the first time that a Brexit story is here, and it’s certainly not going to be the last. The Brexit referendum is the European news media’s Donald Trump - they’re going to milk the story for all it’s worth for years to come. The country is attempting a preemptive strike against the economic downturn that all the prophecies have predicted now that it is moving out of EU. Accordingly, the UK finance minister has [announced](http://in.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-osborne-idINKCN0ZJ0VN) plans to cut corporate tax rates from 20% to 15%. For some context, most developed countries average a corporate tax rate of 25%, India taxes at 35%. As the UK’s currency fell to 31-year lows in the foreign exchange markets, the Bank of England (UK’s central bank) [eased](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/05/bank-of-england-releases-150bn-pounds-risks-financial-stability) regulations on banks which freed up £150 billion that banks can lend to people and businesses. How does any of this relate to India? UK’s Business Secretary Sajid Javid (who sports a forehead that rivals that of Sonakshi Sinha’s) is [going](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/brexit-india-uk-to-hold-trade-talks/article8823969.ece) on a world tour of nations including India to hold discussions about a possible trade treaty. Seriously, google him right now. His head is more forehead than face. 

**LPT: Don’t Be Hungry In Kerala**

Incredible India is all good, but have you tasted the food here? Clearly, India is a fat man’s paradise. If you leave out Kerala, that is. The state just [imposed](http://food.ndtv.com/food-drinks/fat-tax-introduced-in-kerala-14-5-to-be-levied-on-fast-food-chains-like-mcdonalds-1429427) a 14.5% tax on food that makes you fatter, like burgers, pizzas, sandwiches, donuts etc. While subsidies are often used to encourage consumption of certain things, on the flip side, taxes are often used to discourage consumption of certain things. And Kerala’s government just wants to discourage fat people from being fat. The move is expected to bring in additional revenue of ₹10 crore to the state while mostly affecting fast food chains like McDonalds, Subway, Pizza Hut etc. The idea of a ‘fat tax’ is nothing new - it’s been implemented in countries like Denmark and Hungary, a country that sounds a lot like hungry. Coincidence? Definitely, yeah.

**Banks: Desperate Times, Desperate Measures**

Months after the banks started drowning in a pool of bad loans, the water level has come up enough to inspire some desperate deals. The nation’s second largest lender, ICICI had loaned ₹3,000 crore to Essar Steel, the Ruia-family owned company. But Essar has fallen on pretty hard times and can’t pay the loans back. So the banks got together and started searching for someone who can buy a majority stake in Essar, takeover the management and turn the company around. But it’s all fun and games until reality sets in - which is that nobody wants to even touch Essar Steel with a ten-foot pole. Last week, realizing that a solution was unlikely, ICICI [sold](http://www.livemint.com/Industry/8CVTPujGZTeE2W7iBUr45M/ICICI-Bank-sells-Essar-Steel-loan-exposure-to-Edelweiss-ARC.html) those loans worth about ₹1,600 crore to Edelweiss. The Jaypee Group, known perhaps for its cement business, found itself in similar condition where it had borrowed just a little more than it could handle. Fortunately, somebody did touch that company with a ten-foot pole. The company [sold](http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/buzzing-stocks/jp-associates-ultratech5-38rs-16189-cr-cement-deal_6982041.html) a lot of cement manufacturing plants to UltraTech Cement for ₹16,189 crore that it can potentially use to repay loans. To consolidate in times of trouble, State Bank of India is merging with its associate banks from Travancore, Mysore and others. But along with employees who fear being fired after the merger, a lot of businesses that are customers of the banks being acquired are [protesting](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/money-and-banking/now-customers-too-voice-concern-over-sbi-associate-banks-merger/article8807858.ece) the merger. Why? Well, how would you like it if your local grocery shopkeeper who knows you by name suddenly sold out to Big Bazaar?

**Loans From Flipkart**

The list of top 3 disasters in India goes like this: 1) the Bhopal Gas Tragedy, 2) Sholay-remake *Ram Gopal Verma Ki Aag* and 3) Flipkart’s Big Billion Day. The online retailer’s annual big sales event that comes every year started in 2014 and fetched the company ₹650 crore. But it was marred by failure in shipping which resulted in thousands of frustrated customers, and the company has been trying to rebuild the Big Billion Day brand ever since. The second Big Billion Day happened last year, raked in ₹2,000 crore for the company and sailed through relatively easily. This time, however, Flipkart feels shaky on being able to deliver without a glitch. It’s [making](http://thetechportal.com/2016/07/05/flipkart-brings-back-big-billion-day-major-changes/) plans to have a one huge Big Billion Day in the first week of October, followed by similar smaller events to spread the orders around. At a time when banks are becoming more cautious about lending to certain sectors of the economy, Flipkart is also planning to play matchmaker between banks and borrowers by offering pre-approved loans so you can buy now, pay later. The company is in talks with banks to arrange the loans which will be paid back by Flipkart in case people just decide to run with their Flipkart-bought flat screens and laptops.

Mallya, however, insists that he did no such thing.

Policy/Economy,Unpopular Opinion: The future of India's clean energy Hybrids and EVs looks bleak to me,"I know the Govt. has been pushing to increase EVs' penetration in India substantially as soon as possible because our air quality has become easily the world's most polluted, but given the state of things, both politically and technologically, it seems like an impossible task right now.

Nitin Gadkari said earlier last year,

&gt; “There is no need for any policy now. The electric vehicle (EV) standards finalized by Niti Aayog will be used as final benchmark.”

Vice Chairman of Niti Ayog:

&gt; “We need a policy to put it all together (charging infrastructure, battery swapping) and we can’t just have people running around on their own and ministries working in silos.""

Piyush Goyal, now the Minister of Coal and railways stated that the Prime Minister had constituted a core group of senior ministers to “lead the initiative and make sure that by 2030, most, if not all, vehicles in India are powered by electricity.”

He himself was rebutted by his colleague, Babul Supriyo, when he responded with a written reply in Lok Sabha that there was no deadline specified and his ministry of heavy industries &amp; public enterprises was given no timeframe for 100% electric mobility.

All of these contradictory statements by different departments of the Government has thrown the entire automobile sector in a state of confusion. Are we going to do it? Are we not going to do it? What are the exact goals? Because the goals, as specified by Piyush Goyal, are delusional at best and you cannot magically convert **most** Indian vehicles plying on the road today into electrical vehicles by 2030. It doesn't take one to be a CEO of one of the leading automobile manufacturing companies to see that.

Apart from that, most of India's electricity comes from burning fossil fuel. It's not clean energy. So what are we even fighting for? That would just mean that implementation of these schemes coercing people to buy EVs would only move the pollution off city roads to its hinterlands, where that power is generated.

Let's talk about FAME II now- As MD, Bajaj Auto, Rajiv Bajaj, put it, ""They're putting the cart before the horse."" As in, seeking to accelerate manufacturing in India without ensuring there is adequate demand for the electric and hybrid vehicles so produced. Only buses priced up to ₹2 crore, strong and plug-in hybrids under ₹15 lakh, three-wheelers under ₹5 lakh and two-wheelers under ₹1.5 lakh will be eligible for incentives. In face of the potential and present dire consequences, India should be doing even better than US and Norway and go out of it's way to incentivize EVERY GODDAMN Hybrid and EV under the sun (pun intended). Every single one of them. Western countries aren't making their citizens breathe air that is multiple times more dangerous than recommended for a normal human to intake and they still offer more generous subsidies and invest tons more in awareness programs for the same.

FAME II will also offer incentives to manufacturers, who invest in developing electric vehicles and its components, including lithium-ion batteries and electric motors since developing li-ion batteries (used both in EVs and PHEVs) are very expensive to manufacture in India because lithium is not produced in India. On the other hand, China produces batteries en-masse but the citizens and their representatives in the houses today are more concerned about China getting India's balls in a vice over it's over-reliance on China for it's automobile sector's crucial driving force (quite literally) than coughing their lungs out. Needless to say, PRIORITIES ARE FLAWED.

I do not understand why Hybrids are so far out of the reach of the average Indian buyer today, even though that tech came to India way before EVs. As explained above, EVs are still too costly to produce in India because of lack of local lithium production, are impractical to buy with a purpose of making the air cleaner because India burns fossil fuels anyways to produce most of it's electricity and no feasible charging network exists even in most metropolitan cities for anyone to even consider it as an incentive to buy these vehicles. In that case, a typical middle-class person concerned about environment would be left with only Hybrids for options. But if you do some research, it seems almost no attractive options other than a Maruti Ciaz are available for him/her out in the market to buy a Hybrid. Hybrids are way more fuel efficient and less-polluting than your normal IC engines. FAME II is also known to offer incentives on them. So why is that? They don't even need specialized charging stations like EVs so it's beyond me why manufacturers have forsaken them. Maybe it has something to do with the worldwide trend of moving to SUVs as the most popular choice of transportation, offered even to the lower-tier customer base.

So to summarize, the Government doesn't really know what it wants or what it's doing apart from the end goal and an all-over-the-place FAME scheme it has no idea how to execute, that confuses the automobile manufacturers and they're not bringing their EVs into the Indian market as they see working on complying to BS VI norms as the safest bet right now, India's tendency to burn fossil fuels to generate electricity and old, outdated grids that eliminate all possibility of setting up government-endorsed at-home chargers, slow development of public fast chargers due to lack of manufacturers' interest in introducing EVs (or introducing affordable Hybrids even, for that matter), government's ""selective"" incentives on EVs and hybrids causing the rich, who are usually at the forefront of all new automobile tech introduced in a country and become the trendsetters, to look at IC engine vehicles as better alternatives and lack of local lithium production despite incentives.

No wonder India's not making any strides in it's overly-ambitious but poorly implemented goals for cleaner air.

Reasonable thoughts and discussions are welcome. On the other hand, if you have an overly-optimistic, dreamy-eyed opinion which has nothing to do with ground reality or logic in general, you can kindly go hang."

## Highlights

* **Background:** On June 28, 2019, the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) invited bids from reputed turnkey solution providers for the implementation of a centralised Automated Facial Recognition System (AFRS).
* **Need for established safeguards:** The proposal to introduce facial recognition into society currently comes with a variety of concerns that need to be addressed first. We write a legal notice to the NCRB  with also a covering letter and a copy of the notice to Home Minister, Shri. Amit Shah and Home Secretary, Shri. Rajiv Gauba, highlighting the features and scope of the AFRS and its unfathomable detriment it could bring about to Indians if implemented.

## Know your enemy

Its important to understand the characteristics the Request for Proposals requires the systems to possess, in order to understand how problematic it will be. Our legal notice highlights features which will be covered here in brief to provide basic context.

1. *Function:* The AFRS is intended to be a repository of all crime and criminal related facial data and should be able to identify or verify a person from a variety of inputs ranging from images to videos.
2. *Integration:* The system should be able to be integrated with various other databases such as ICJS, CCTNS, IVFRT, state police integration software in existence or any others. The integration does not stop there, it requires the system to be compatible with other biometric solutions such as Iris and AFIS but doesn't specify what these databases are. Might we have yet another Aadhaar worry to add to our frown lines?
3. *Identification:* As per requirements of the RFP, the system should not only be able to match images from a variety of databases, it should also be equipped to capture images from CCTV footage, public or private video feeds. As concerning as this sounds, there's more. It should also have the ability to tag images uploaded from newspapers, raids, sketches etc. with identifiers based on sex, age, scars, tattoos, consider landmarks, features and contours in identifying individuals and also accommodate for images with plastic surgery and make up for accuracy in identification.
4. *Technical requirements:* The aspects that stuck out in the RFP largely related to the need for the system to be compatible with bio-metric solutions such as Iris and Fingerprint identification systems. It also requires there that there be security in storage, user access and authentication
5. *Security requirements:* The bidder is largely responsible for additional measures in maintaining the integrity, confidentiality and availability of data that will be stored, apart from the established ISO standard prescribed in the RFP.

## Here's why we aren't quite ready for sci-fi

We take a closer look at these *not so frightening* features and identify concerns with the entire technology itself.

* *Absence of legality:* The requirement of facial recognition systems does not stem from a statutory basis nor is it a result of the executive power of the Government. Clearly it lacks any sort of legal backing. This is in addition to the violation of privacy it will so flagrantly undermine as it fails to fulfil any of the elements laid down by Puttaswamy v. Union of India (2017 (10) SCALE 1) in permitting a violation of privacy.
* *Manifest arbitrariness:* Beginning to picture the massive invasion of privacy the AFRS will potentially have? Especially with its all seeing eye looking at not only databases  and databases of images but also strategically located CCTV footage, images of newspaper clippings, raids, sketches etc., all most likely without your knowledge. This kind of en-masse surveillance is bound to bring about a high degree of damage. Studies by MIT and Georgetown and trials conducted the London Metropolitan Police acknowledge that pervasive biases that exist currently within our societies are likely to be mimicked by the algorithms within these systems. Mis-identification and discriminatory profiling is the result we're looking at if these systems are implements. Apparently, the already existing discriminatory practices perpetuated by human beings is no longer enough, we must look to AI to continue our dirty work.
* *Absence of safeguards and accountability:* In light of the above, there is currently no legal restrictions or limitations to this technology to ensure its proportional use or afford protection to those it interacts with. Add facial recognition to the on going debate on CCTVs and we have ourselves a full fledged mix of India and China no longer being restricted to the Indo-Chinese cuisine.

Considering the trajectory India appears to be on with mass surveillance and technological perpetuating of discrimination, a scarier version of the Orwellian dystopia seems to be right up our alley. We urge the NCRB to take a step back and recall the bidding process for the Automated Facial Recognition System until adequate safeguards that address these various concerns are put into place. This request is also with a disclaimer that failure to do so may cause us to seek remedy in accordance with the law.

https://i.redd.it/dbfff8lv7di31.png

Today marks the second year anniversary of a momentous day in constitutional history in the digital day and age. On August 24, 2017, the Right to Privacy was identified as a fundamental right under the Constitution of India by a nine judge bench of the Supreme Court. The declaration of privacy as a right has had manifold impact not only affecting direct issues of data protection but even larger areas of mass surveillance and personal aspect such as the right to one's own sexuality.

The Right to Privacy is very close to our hearts, it has been one of IFF's core issues and we have consistently been working to ensure the same for citizens of India.  Our fight for privacy has persisted since the introduction of the Draft Personal Data Protection Bill, 2018 with submissions to public consultations, RTIs requesting transparency and disclosure, advocating for privacy through intrusive government schemes such as CCTVs and facial recognition systems and most recently, the tabling of the Personal Data and Information Privacy Code, 2019 in the Lok Sabha aided by the wonderful Dr. Ravi Kumar (Lok Sabha, MP from Tamil Nadu). This is only the beginning.

We will work with all institutions of governance and also continue to challenge them to do better, to continue to work towards ensuring an individual's right to privacy is put first and foremost.

In light of this journey as country, IFF due to the partnership and support of Mozilla will celebrate today with an event that will feature talks and a conversation with Justice B.N. Srikrishna. This will be to the benefit to a cross section of stakeholders and we hope bring varied perspectives such as on gender and criminal justice that are an integral parcel of privacy right. Since seating and space has been limited we are video recording this event and will post it online soon.

We are also encouraging a wider community today to mark, celebrate on what privacy means to them by posting on social media. We have created a document with a few tweets on privacy [at this link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iYlIC7Pv8TxkIm3tKXv1DqyHvSWPsMVf-OcQRJydb7s/edit?usp=sharing) for you tweet out personally. If you feel like it please do consider tagging it with #PrivacySupreme.

Thank you!

If you support the Right to Privacy, help us support you. [***Become an IFF member today***](https://internetfreedom.in/donate/)***!***"

Policy/Economy,Economic Shit Storm Incoming brace for impact : What failure of corporate tax rate may imply.,"Before getting bombarded, let me say that it is what if scenario which is rather pessimistic but a possibility nonetheless, and I vehemently believe that we are facing growth recession if not outright recession as of now. 

1) Lack of new job creation, decrease in purchasing power, negligible increase in either headline inflation or core inflation, 2-3% gdp growth rate, if we calculate gdp using previous base year, has substantiated that we are or are heading to recession. Recession doesn't always mean negative gdp growth rate. 

2) Uncertain and draconian policy : Fast changing policies which have proved to be bereft of commitment by actual spending and pervading religious divide and ideology is eating away a part of budget.


Damocles Sword

3) Infrastructure projects underway, but for whome? Bullet train, statues and home creation, but none of them are infrastructure investment which will help economy at scale and will come out to bite few years later.

4) Migrating tendency : Large mobilisation by semi-elite and educated group due to ease of getting residential cards given that you are competent. It should increase by substantial amount after global economy slow down is over and again will bite back later due to the fact that with lack of skilled man power fewer companies will invest


Deflation & Lack of buffer and misguided policies

5) Corporation tax cut : Current situation is because of lack of purchasing power even among those who are employed and even a cursory glance at past will tell that India has never seen tickle down Impact so I don't expect increase in PP 1) It will fail to attract new investment 2) Goods may get cheaper which will lead to deflation.

6) Possible Deflation : With lack of buffer and policy failure, we will spiral down to deflation and products will get cheaper but people will start losing jobs at hitherto rate.

New minted currency as catalyst to breaking economic cycle and perhaps for even worse 

7) Bottleneck Inflation leading to stagflation : Demand will stay the same or may even increase while infrastructure will be severely lacking and to boost economy, we may see new minted currencies and it will lead to rising prices(inflation) but job loss will still stay the same 

8) Lack of foreign investment : Above should be enough to deter any large FDI flow.

Policy/Economy,Economics. That is why I support the BJP / NDA.,"Every second day there is a thread on ""Why do educated people support that fount of communal poison the BJP"". Instead of all of us endlessly circle jerking over subjective stuff, I wanted to take a slightly different approach and put forth some key macro economic indicators that compare data from NDA I era and the UPA I & II regimes. I even plotted graphs on an excel, but imgur won't allow me to upload excel graphs and I have no idea how to upload these onto Reddit otherwise, ideas welcome. Also how does one make tables on Reddit? Copy pasting from excel again does not work.

**The Data** -

Indicator	        NDA	     UPA I	       UPA II
Agriculture    2.78%	    3.07%	       4.10%
Industry	      5.80%	    9.10%       5.10%
Services	      7.60%	    9.90%	      8.09%

On GDP growth rates, nothing much to choose from though the UPA seems to have done well across all sectors, as to how this wa achieved, I will cover it a little later.

Indicator	NDA	UPA I	UPA II
CAD	3.40%	-13.12%	-56.58%

On CAD, the UPA performance looks horrible, one could attribute increasing oil prices (it touched a peak of $ 100 a barrel) to a certain extent, but it is only a portion of why the CAD went down so horribly.
 
Indicator	        NDA	UPA I	UPA II
Inflation WPI	4.58	5.9	         7.08
Inflation CPI	3.86	6.04	10.18

Inflation seems to have been horribly mismanaged by the UPA, and this is largely due to deficit financing and pumping in huge funds into the rural sector in the form of MNREGA. The MNREGA was in the larger picture actually bad for the intended recipients as it drove up prices over and hurt the economy as a whole.

Indicator	       NDA	UPA I	UPA II
Fiscal Deficit	3.8	30.86	76

Again, how did the UPA achieve the funding of such profligate schemes such as MNREGA or the Food Safety Act or the loan waiver? By deficit financing. It essentially spent more (which govts usually do) more than what it earned. This also has the side effect of fueling inflation.

And now we come to why I believe even these numbers are illusionary,

Absolute Increase in Employment (mn)	NDA	UPA
Agriculture	                                              21.25      -15.71
Manufacturing	                                              11.72	-7.23
Non Manufacturing	                                        9.11	26.14
Services	                                                      18.77	-0.48
Total	                                                       60.85	2.72

The net jobs added by the NDA in 10 years as compared to the UPA in 12 (data for 2013 on was not available)  is not even comparable and this is why I believe the UPA growth was an illusory / jobless growth.

Factor in the 10 million unemployed people hitting our workforce every year and it is imperative that as a nation we find jobs for all of them.

Another factor I would have liked to compare but as data is not available prior to 2008 I will leave it out of scope but just mention it. This is the indicator of Gross Fixed Capital Formation in infrastructure. The NDA as well know focussed a lot on infrastructure, roads and the highway network being chief amongst these. The NDA added more roads in 5 years than 30 years of other governments combined. Without the govt massively investing in actual infrastructure, job creation and economic growth is going to be difficult to manage.

This is not new either (the UPA mismanagement), Indira Gandhi did pretty much the same thing. She created an import fueled bubble of illusory growth that broke very quickly and fueled massive inflation. *Windows of Opportunity: Memoirs of an Economic Adviser by Krishnaswamy* goes into detail into how Indira almost wrecked the national economy by recklessly devaluing the currency and sending inflation soaring to 75% in the late 60's. Indira also established the trend of a socialistic economy (not her father, who piloted a Mixed economy) by ruthlessly nationalising every industry from coal to banking to wheat and imposing draconian restrictions on the private sector. Indira ALSO failed to focus on infrastructure, and during her first regime, cut down on investment in infrastructure.

After Nehru who did very well to guide the Indian economy given his set of challenges, every succeeding Gandhi dynast has been an absolute disaster for the national economy. 

The problem is, the Gandhi / Congress way has now caught on and almost every major party follows the same dead approach of populsim, throwing sops during election time and forgetting about even basic economics.

**Subjective opinion**- In BJP I see a party that is serious about building up infrastructure, that is serious about creating jobs, that while populist, marries this populism with a sense of pragmatism. It is arguably the only party right now that sees merit in manufacturing as being the workhorse of the Indian economy. I see how the BJP method has worked (relative to India of course) in places like Chatisgarh, MP, Gujarat, Goa. Yes, it has failed in Karnataka, yet it has the resilience to learn and apply lessons and not just throw up some dynast scion to continue the same tired old politics.

Sloganeering, empty tokenism and sops all won't work without some hard reforms, and this is something the BJP has an established track record in and this is why I support the BJP.

* **Background:** Two writ petitions were filed in the Madras High Court in July 2018 praying for the interlinking of Aadhaar with social media for identity authentication purposes. We were deeply concerned with this development and decided to intervene.
* **Intervention time:** Given the relevance of these cases, IFF goes to Court for the 6th time, continuing its fight for the right to privacy of the citizens of  India, amongst various other concerns. Our stand in court is to protect user privacy, prevent surveillance but also to address the harms and regulatory issues such as end-to-end encryption which are of concern to the Hon'ble Court. Rest assured, all our submissions are to advance digital rights and the constitutional values!

### / Why we decided to intervene.

Information is necessary for a well functioning society. However, it also carries power and creates social structures. For instance social media while making sure all of us remain connected is no longer merely a way to stay in touch. It has become a way of life and permits a wider functionality. This also carries risks and harms. Many social media platforms today are rife with abuse, misinformation and illegal content. It is undermining the demos of Indian democracy. A solution which has been posed in the Madras High Court is linking the real world identities (government ID's such as Aadhaar) with social media accounts.

Concerned by these developments, in early June, 2019, we filed two interventions in *Antony Clement Rubin v. Union of India &amp; Ors* (W.P. No. 20774/2018) and *Janani Krishnamurthy v. Union of India* (W.P. No. 20214/2018). This is in our continuing work in approaching and assisting courts all over India in matters related to technology and fundamental rights. In the hearing today, our intervention application was accepted by the Hon'ble High Court of Madras. We thank our counsels Arun Karthik Mohan and Suhrith Parthasarathy for their representation.

### // Why linking Aadhaar to social media is terrible.

Aadhaar being linked with our social media accounts? Here's why we think this would result in a terrible outcome.

* **Increased power of social media companies over users:** It would undermine the right to privacy in several ways. At present we can only visualise a few, and as we very well know with technology based policy interventions, the outcomes are often much worse and the threats only multiple when user rights are not considered at the outset. For instance, it would allow social media companies to gather deeper, more granular information about their users. A government ID, especially one such as Aadhaar which has a common identifier would permit them to link the personal data on the social media platform more easily. This would result in more pervasive dossiers of social media users available to the highest bidder who can serve us then with ads across platforms. Not to mention it would also increase the harms to speech by chilling dissenting voices.
* **Troubling legality:** This also becomes troubling neatly on the legality of the proposal. As per us, the private use of Aadhaar remains problematic as indicated by the Hon'ble Supreme Court. This becomes incredibly dangerous when it is mandatorily linked to our social media accounts. All this is happening while we are still governed by deficient safeguards, that were devised for telephone tapping applied to digital surveillance by the government. In a related matter to reform the safeguards for government surveillance (which is at present occurring without any judicial oversight) we have made a constitutional challenge through a petition in the Supreme Court of India by filing *Internet Freedom Foundation v. Union of India* (W.P. (C). No. 44/2019) \[Soon coming up for hearing on July 2, 2019\].
* **Increased risk to minors and women:** Linking real world identities may counter intuitively also contribute to the spreading of misinformation, abuse and threats which not only result in a direct attack against our democracy but also allows for individualised harms which more often come through to women and children. Women (other persons as well, especially individuals from vulnerable groups) in India quite often have adopted pseudonyms on social media to avoid censure from family, acquaintances or wider social judgement. Linking their Aadhaar to their social media accounts would tremendously increase informational risks even rising to the level of threats to their physical security.

### /// A short statement on today's developments

IFF's executive director, Apar Gupta stated that, ""*We are grateful to the Hon'ble Madras High Court for permitting us to make submissions given the vexed issues of Aadhaar and social media linking. This was possible due to the submissions of our counsel Suhrith Parthasarthy who is advising and representing us in this case. He also indicated the larger issues before the court on which we plan to engage in future hearings. Given the pervasive use of social media in our lives and the existing tools to harvest and utilise data for marketing purposes, not to mention, individualised advertisements, the entire gathering of personal data itself has been a constant cause for concern in the law few years. Adding Aadhaar to this cocktail for the purpose of verification of identity would arguably create further harm. This case also concerns issues of online abuse, misinformation which can contribute to challenges to social order and when law enforcement is deficient, even violence. Hence, the Hon'ble Court has also in recent hearings been considering issues of intermediary liability and end-to-end encryption. On all these issues, IFF's staff will work with care to ensure submissions are made to safeguard and protect the digital rights of every social media user in India.*""

In continuance with IFF's mission -- we will keep approaching courts in a systematic and planned manner to ensure the protection of the fundamental rights of every India.

Transparency is a hallmark in all of IFF's work. Hence, as with all our filed case pleadings even a copy of the intervention application is made public and is available in the link below. The next date for hearing in this case is July 26, 2019.

Policy/Economy,Oil slump? India will rather play dumb by raising prices,"https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/government-raises-excise-duty-on-petrol-diesel-by-rs-3-per-litre-2194742?pfrom=home-topstories

The taxes on Petrol and Diesel have grown by over 100% in the tenure of Modi government. While the other big economies are trying to ensure that they do not go in economic slump by easing their monetary policy, India is busy dampening consumer confidence.

This news closely follows another one where the Modi government fired Urjit PATEL for not financing 1.56L crores worth of government expenditure.

The markets are reeling heavily downwards under pressure due to C scare, and it is very likely that the investors will pull out their investments from higher risk based emerging economies. In a looming recession, the growth can flee and the institutional investors may pull out in hoards.

The Indian banks are failing and the modi government is further dampening the consumer confidence by raising taxes on staple like Petrol. The recent drop in oil prices was perfect opportunity for the government to announce a reduction. 

In the times needing economic rescue via freer monetary measures , the government has chosen to play out a decision lacking economic prudence."

Policy/Economy,ACCOUNTABILITY: This is what is wrong with Indian bureaucracy and our Brown Lords.,"If you are an Indian, it would be an astronomically impossible odd that you didn’t hear of how corrupt our bureaucracy is or how some **‘babu‘** or some **‘bade sahab‘** is corrupt and nothing more than a public disgrace. **That’s Indian bureaucracy for you.**

The real problem with bureaucrats is not just about caste and reservation. It is about accountability and responsibility. The pay structure of our Bureaucracy is such that officers get little salaries and large perks and amenities in form of bungalows and servants. In many cases, they occupy the same bungalows that the British left in 1947. And they do not do their job responsibly.

Fair disclosure that *I do understand and acknowledge the fact not all bureaucrats are corrupt. In fact, we have exemplary civil servants that have served as an inspiration to us all.* But this post is not about them, those honest civil servants. This is about what is wrong with Indian bureaucracy. The problem is not about the political issue or power struggles, but about an entire class of bureaucrats who are egoistic, arrogant, inhumane, corrupt and muddled with skulduggery.

**Bureaucrats, Bureaucracy, and Bureaucratic Measures** are now modern day derogatory overtones that express tyranny, arrogance and debilitation in our country’s governance. Bureaucrats are, in this day and age, perceived as those with massive egos and false nationalist zealotry. They are in essence a rule-bound bookkeepers who have ‘I’ mentality when it comes to interpreting rules. They play favorites, they are biased, they stay vague so that they are not held accountable, and they maintain chaos so that no one can see them cheat.

**From Outside: Looking In**

Don’t take my word for it. *I am just an ordinary Indian citizen exercising my freedom of speech.* Wouldn’t it help if you could see our Indian bureaucracy from an outside view? It is said that an unbiased opinion comes from the uninvolved. So let’s do that. Let’s see what others think of Indian bureaucracy.

In October 2010, just after the conclusion of Commonwealth Games in India, Eric Ellis wrote a post titled ‘A most uncivil service‘ on The Age where he talks about the Indian bureaucracy. Unfortunately, he has nothing good to say. He writes the following –

>""The Delhi games showed the world just what can be done when it's daunting civil service takes control – and the result wasn’t pretty. Corruption, waste, inefficiency, obfuscation and a cancerous lack of accountability in officialdom – and all of it on an Olympian scale.

>Delhi’s dramas may have been revealing for observers who briefly touch India but sadly these are the common issues daily confronting and long bedeviling a billion Indians and the foreign investors urged to invest their money in business there. Some economists have calculated that India’s bureaucratic inefficiency costs the country 1 to 2 points in annual growth.

>India’s daunting civil service is supposed to be the pride of the nation – just ask its privileged nabobs – but instead its malfunction and misgovernance hold India back. Enter any average government office in India and one is struck by the mountains of yellowing paperwork, years of filing and unfinished work ground down by the sheer scale of chaotic India’s myriad issues that overwhelm.""


Another account by Lant Pritchett of Harvard University sheds some brighter light on the Indian bureaucratic problem. In a paper, in 2009, titled “Is India a Failing State?“, he described Indian bureaucracy to be one of the most serious problems in the world today; up there with AIDS and climate change. He makes a point that foreign investments, and any welfare schemes in India for that matter, will never improve India’s economy as long as there is an inefficient Indian bureaucracy. These bureaucrats are like a tumorous growth that eat away any welfare funds like a parasite.

In his book “The Foundation Pillars for Change: Our Nation, Our Democracy & Our Future”, **Mr. V.K. Patel** writes that *most developmental spending fails to reach its intended recipients. It is either diverted or misused by a sizeable and a complacent bureaucracy.* I corroborate to Mr. Patel’s description of bureaucracy.

*We need to take away these IAS’s comfortable life devoid of any accountability for their country. Take away their big bungalows, their VIP status, their guards, their peons, their orderlies and hook them up to a system where they are rewarded for their good acts and punished for their bad deeds. Unless and until such an overhaul happens, India is not going to be a great country. No welfare policies will ever come to fruition. India cannot change without a change in our bureaucratic system. This is what is wrong with the Indian bureaucracy.*"

On 30.07.2019, media reports and various user complaints brought to light an issue that caused the automatic registration of unified payments interface (UPI) based IDs of Truecaller users without their knowledge and consent. We wrote to NPCI indicating concern and suggesting immediate and intermediate action ([**read more**](https://internetfreedom.in/true-caller-or-false-caller-we-ask-ncpi-to-answer-this-question/)).

NPCI wrote back to us in less than 48 hours agreeing with the contents of our representation. It also indicated two specific steps. *First* it had stopped on boarding new Truecaller users on the UPI Platform. *Second* the matter is under investigation and we will be informed after diligence is completed in all matters. We will keep urging for public disclosure that will have multiple benefits. It will help inform impacted users, improve processes in technology companies and further greater trust in the UPI ecosystem.

But also, let us step back for a moment. This is not only about Truecaller. It is about user consent more widely. The privacy, safety and security of users of the UPI interface. While for a complete remedy we need a data protection law (*which India does not have yet*) that is user centric *(*[***like the Indian Privacy Code***](https://saveourprivacy.in/principles)); we appreciate and commend the actions being taken by NPCI within its mandate and urge it do more.

**Apple’s New China Is India**

When Steve Jobs, ex-hippie and the founder of Apple, visited India in the 1970s, he wore a lungi and [roamed](http://gadgets.ndtv.com/others/news/what-steve-jobs-did-in-india-35-years-ago-225246) barefoot. Until, of course, the Indian national disease of diarrhea cut his trip short and sent him back to the US. Fortunately for all of us, when Tim Cook, the current CEO of Apple, visited India last week his attire did not include a lungi and he probably drank bottled water, as is tradition for all foreign tourists in India. In between wild Bollywood parties at SRK’s house and IPL matches in Kanpur, Tim [announced](http://www.wsj.com/articles/apples-tim-cook-samples-bollywood-cricket-in-bid-to-woo-india-1463822223) a startup accelerator in Bengaluru and the opening of two new offices including one in Hyderabad. It wasn’t all play and no work - Tim met with businessmen like the CEOs of ICICI Bank, Vodafone India, TCS and heads of state like Prime Minister Modi, the Telangana CM and many more. But why India and why now? After reporting the first quarterly decline in sales that was largely caused due to slowing growth in China, Apple is now searching for something other than China to fuel growth for the coming decade. And Apple’s next China might just be India. Tim termed his visit to India as ‘fantastic’ but then again, he also ran into Alia Bhatt. So it’s entirely possible that his statements were laced with sarcasm.  

**The One With Trump, Brexit and India**

Britain, the former colonial master of India and more countries than you can even name, is going through an independence movement of its own. Currently, the country is a part of the European Union, a political and economic union of 28 countries in Europe. In a public vote to be held on June 23rd, Britishers will decide if the nation will stay in the European Union or get out of the European Union. All of that may be Britain’s headache but a new report out of SBI [suggests](http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-brexit-can-open-up-opportunities-for-india-sbi-research-report-2212552) that even though a Brexit (Britain leaving the European Union) could be terrible for Europe, it could turn out to be hugely beneficial for India since Indian companies will no longer need to follow complex trade agreements while dealing with Britain. Likewise, a former US Diplomat says a Trump presidency in the US, while [terrible](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/if-donald-trump-becomes-us-president-india-may-gain-at-chinas-expense-heres-why/articleshow/52380459.cms) for China and Pakistan (...not to mention Mexico) might actually turn out to be great for India as ~~Donald Trump~~ Dear Leader’s foreign policies are likely to shift the balance of power in Asia in favour of India. The word to describe what you’re feeling right now is schadenfreude - taking pleasure in the misfortunes of others. Trust me, *I know words.

**The Banking Bloodbath**

With the whole bad loans crisis being shoved in everyone’s faces, it’s no surprise that banks are feeling the heat. Saddled with a ton of losses caused by increasing net non-performing assets (the fancy term for bad loans), conditions are becoming dire. A host of smaller banks reported earnings last week and it’s not good. If you have a phobia of falling bank profits, turn away now and seek professional help because it’s about to get gruesome. Alright, [here](http://www.livemint.com/Money/1MpJ5uNbQXhacOWKTo3PWJ/PSU-banks-shares-fall-after-weak-earnings.html) we go: Dena Bank reported a loss of ₹326 crore, Allahabad Bank reported a loss of ₹581 crore, Central Bank of India reported a loss of ₹898 crore, UCO Bank reported a loss of ₹1,715 crore and Syndicate Bank [reported](http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/results/syndicate-bank-q4-loss-at-rs-2158cr-provisions-jump-3-fold_6677621.html) a loss of ₹2,158 crore. Going for the silver medal is Bank of Baroda with a loss of ₹3,230 crore, the second highest loss in the history of Indian banking. And now, for the gold medal, the worst loss in the history of Indian banking ever was reported at a record-breaking ₹5,367 crore by *drumroll* Punjab National Bank. It feels good to have found the rock-bottom at last. At least now, there is nowhere to go but up. That’s what investors in bank stocks are saying to themselves so they can sleep well at night. Let’s hope for their sake that we don’t find a new bottom in the next quarter.

**|| || || > | | | | | |**

So you might’ve heard: The banking industry is in a bit of a tight spot. There haven’t been any bankruptcies (phew) yet. But there’s blood on the streets. And the only way to patch the wound is to stick together in times of trouble. State Bank of India, one of the largest banks in India, [proposed](http://profit.ndtv.com/news/industries/article-bank-of-india-says-no-talks-on-merging-with-any-other-lenders-1408323) a plan to stick together and merge with its 5 associate banks: State Bank of Bikaner & Jaipur, State Bank of Hyderabad, State Bank of Travancore, State Bank of Patiala and State Bank of Mysore plus the newly created Bharatiya Mahila Bank. If merged, the combined bank will become a banking behemoth with 50 crore customers. And behemoths don’t bleed easy. Taking cue, the government is also urging UCO Bank, Bank of India and Indian Overseas Bank (all of whom have reported losses) to find themselves a relatively well off bank and merge their losses away. Playing the merger game is tricky business. You don’t want your merger to be like Romeo and Juliet. Sure, they made history but they both died in the end. You want your merger to be like Aladdin and Princess Jasmine. One that can live happily ever after.

Narayana Murthy, co-founder of Infosys, however has in the past suggested that the highest salary paid in a company shouldn’t be more than 25 times the lowest salary paid in the company.

* Vijay Mallya, who has indirectly paid the salaries of thousands of journalists around the world along with Donald Trump, is scared.

Accordingly, Mallya [says](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/vijay-mallya-fugitive-businessman-consider-india-return-if-safety-freedom-assured-1560279) he’ll only return if his safety and freedom is assured. GOI’s formal request to the British government to extradite Mallya was declined. More problems to boot: A ₹2.4 crore dividend payable to Mallya from United Breweries was withheld.

They say there’s no use digging up old corpses. And declassifying old government records can sometimes certainly feel like digging up old corpses. Well, this time the government might have found a zombie. After releasing old records relating to the Azad Hind Bank, founded by Subhash Chandra Bose, many borrowers have [approached](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2016-05-16/news/73126343_1_currency-notes-bank-notes-legal-tender) the finance ministry asking the government to recognize the currency issued by the Azad Hind Bank in 1944 as legal tender, so they can use it to repay existing loans. In a country of more than a billion people, there’s potential for more than a billion bizarre stories. And this is just one. 

$1 billion is the number of the week for Apple. $1 billion is the amount that Warren Buffett, the billionaire that has traditionally and even proudly shunned technology, has [invested](http://www.economist.com/news/business/21699139-meaning-two-odd-and-connected-investments-1-billion-stakes-menu) in Apple shares over the last quarter. $1 billion is also the amount that Apple invested in Didi, not the Bengali politician, but Uber’s competitor in China. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick’s girlfriend, reportedly owns shares of Apple, which makes her an investor in Didi. That’s got to make for some very awkward pillow talk.

[Edit: at the suggestion of u/abtam11, I am adding a link to a video that highlights some aspects of the bill. https://youtu.be/8l0wPyLQSDg]

Between Teen Talak, Chandrayan, nationwide floods, Article 370 and Economic crash most of you must not have noticed the National Medical Commission Bill (NMC) that was sneaked into the parliament and passed in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha recently. This bill that shakes the healthcare system of the country to the core (and not in a good way) was vehemently opposed by doctors all over India, by black bands, marches, burning copies of the bill and when all else failed, even strikes. Many even got arrested during the protests. Yet, it never even made it to the National news. And the bill passed with barely any opposition. So what is it, why doctors are protesting it and is it really that bad?

Let me save you a lot of time - YES! But that is my opinion. Please feel free to form your own opinion. I am attaching a copy of the bill so you can read it yourself if you want,

 [http://164.100.47.4/BillsTexts/LSBillTexts/Asintroduced/185\_2019\_LS\_Eng.pdf](http://164.100.47.4/BillsTexts/LSBillTexts/Asintroduced/185_2019_LS_Eng.pdf) 

Here are some of the points in the bill that I found very disturbing. 

# Legalization of quackery : 

First please understand that under the current system, students after clearing +2 medical undergo MBBS entrance exams through NEET. After clearing one of the most rigorous competitive exams in existence, they study under gruelling circumstances (in govt colleges and a handful of private colleges) for 4.5 years. The exams every year and after passing Final year MBBS, they have to do one more year of very hard training (internship). After that, they have to pass yet another exam called the NEET PG entrance exam to gain admission for MD/MS courses to become a specialist. Since the value of MBBS has greatly decreased, this has become a mainstream process for ost doctors across the country before practicing.

Also note that India has a massive shortage of doctors. According to **WHO, the doctor patient** ratio needs to be **1:1000.** Note that WHO specifies this for government Allopathic doctors. In India this ratio of government allopathic doctors is **1:10,189**. Which means that there is a massive **shortage** of doctors - amost **6 lakh** doctors in the country. This shortage is found in **both urban and rural areas** though the shortage in r**ural areas is more severe.** However, the urban areas are not doing that good either. This is especially when the entire rural population is also seeking healthcare in the urban areas due to **lack of basic facilities and infrastructure** in the rural areas. These deficiencies would not allow for much healthcare provision even if doctors were there.

Also, note that according to WHO standards, India **lacks 2 million nurses** as well. WHO has issued warnings to India regarding its dire state of healthcare and the crisis faced by the people. So the ""brilliant"" (massive sarcasm) solution is this NMC bill was Community Healthcare Providers. We already have a similar system of ANM's that kind of fit the description, so why is this a problem.

The problem lies in the **language of the bill** which is **very vague**.  It states that ""Any person connected to the allopathic heathcare system"" can provide ""primary and preventive healthcare"" ""for a limited period of time""  after a ""6 month training program"". They can work without supervision here. However, under secondary and tertiary hospitals, they will have to work under doctor's suprvision.

Look at the statements in quotes. What does **""any person connected to allopathic healthcare""** mean? Can an ambulance driver get this accredition? Can a ward boy get it? The bill makes no specification. It does not specify the minimum qualification needed for the course. (I could be wrong but I did not find any description). It does not state any experience required or previous job status - nothing.

next it talks about a **6-month training** program. Again, training for what? What courses will be included, What these people will be trained in. How they will be trained. Nothing is specified.

Next it talks about providing **primary healthcare**. From what I understand. Primary healthcare means the treatment one gets at the first point of contact with the healthcare system. Generally, In sane countries where stuff like people's health is important, this means a contact with GP - a general practitioner or physician that can provide basic treatment for basic things. But In a country like India where ""Superpeciality Hospitals"" are the first point of contact for people, the lines between primary and tertiary level healthcare are blurred. **The bill does not define what Primary and Preventive medicine mean**. It is not understood or implied because as I said, anything can be considered primary when given at first point of contact with healthcare. So what treatment can the Community healthcare providers provide? Can they write cardio medications? Can they write pediatric medications? Note that even MBBS students cannot write super specialty treatments or even a head CT to look for brain problems unless under supervision. Even PG students (3 more years after MBBS and internship which makes them a specialist) cannot fiddle with other departments' treatment. And for good reason - the medication and treatment is way more complicated than making a Chandrayan rocket. SO can these people write that? Can they perform operations, which MBBS students cannot do unsupervised? Even PG and beyond need supervision. 

Doctors are strictly regulated when it comes to ultrasound to prevent sex determination and female feticides. (I am not trying to open a debate about whether that is good or bad. Doctors, please focus on the issue at hand) What is the guarantee that these people will not just determine the sex? 

Again, these people are supposed to be practicing in rural areas. There is **no mechanism to make sure** that they will actually **practice in rural areas** and not just peddle pills in urban areas. 

Also, while doctors are bound to write generics and single-dose combinations, there are **zero regulations** in place for these Community Healthcare providers. (CHP) How is this in line with the intention to decrease unregulated indiscriminate use of drugs?

Also, how much time is ""limited period of time""? 3 months, 1 year, 10 years. 100 years? Nothing is specified. Even doctors have to renew their registration every 3 years.

Already people illegally practice allopathy and kill so many people and give them lifelong problems. The govt has claimed to ""stop all quackery"" with this bill. Well yeah, this is one way of doing it. Legalize quackery so there won't be any quacks left. Note that the reports of how well these CHP's do are mostly self-reported and up to now have been for things like uncomplicated delivery and diarrhea. If you talk to doctors they will tell you that in uncomplicated deliveries (which form a large chunk of the deliveries) you have to just catch the baby. The baby and the mother do all the hard work for you. In many cases of bleeding, a simple massage can help stop it. So that is not a very complicated thing to be entrusting to the community. However, comparing that to all primary healthcare is very wrong.

Now, note that doctors are **not opposed** to the idea of community health practitioners **in principle**. Like I said ANM's already exist. However, how the system is set up and managed is the issue. Something more sensible would be welcome. For example. 6-month training program for a nurse with more than 7 years work experience in an MCI approved medical college/hospital specifically to help prevent Acute Encephalitis Syndrome and provide aftercare once the kid has been discharged from the medical college. The appointment should be for 3 years pending renewal and the power to practise should be void outside the specified areas. Add to that some basic management like ORS for diarrhoea, basic hygiene education, women's health education, checking BP, temperature or changing dressings etc (which nurses already do in most hospitals). However, management should be according to doctor's prescription and on any changes immediate referral and contact with the doctor. I don't think many doctors would be opposed to that form of a system. However, this vague wildfire like scenario is extremely scary.

Regarding **no** **supervision** \- why would anyone want to work under supervision when they can work unregulated alone? This will take away nurses etc from the hospitals. As I already mentioned that there is a massive shortage of them, the conditions in hospitals will become even worse as more and more of the nurses (and other professionals or non-professionals) set out to practice legalized quackery. This system should be started after ensuring an increase in the existing personnel, not just redirecting them.

If you want **more rural practitioners**, research has shown that the best way is to **make the system more inclusive** of people born and brought up in rural areas. The medical profession in India is barely in the reach of urban lower middle-class families. Rural population cal only dream of becoming doctors, here in such an exclusive system. But more on that later.

Also, for the people who cite **WHO recommendation for CHP**? - Note that WHO stated this for **very poor countries** that cannot train doctors due to complete lack of funds or war etc. They also stated that this is **highly dependent on the kind of training** received by the workers and care should be taken to ensure proper training for the work. Many countries much much poorer than India have managed a much better healthcare system without the use of these things. In India ( the 7th largest economy set to be a ""5 trillion dollar economy"" (ahem, ahem), what sense does it make to adopt measures for very poor and war-torn countries when we can afford better systems. 

The only sense I can make of it is that it will allow the govt to artificially inflate the numbers on the paper and say that they doubled or trebled the number of ""allopathic"" healthcare providers without having lift a finger. The situation on the ground will not change and might even become worse.

&amp;#x200B;

# 2. The Bridge Course 

The notorious bridge course is back. This allows AYUSH practitioners to practice allopathy after a 6-month ""bridge course"". This is also ridiculous. Note that Ayurveda, Unani, Siddhi and Homeopathy are very different from allopathy. 6 months is not sufficient to learn the materials MBBS doctors find it hard to grasp in 5-8 years. It is hard and a lot of clinical time is required to gain the skills (yes even the meager skills of the doctors these days). That cannot happen in 6 months. This would be like asking a history PhD to build a nuclear reactor. History professor may have a PhD but it is not in physics. similarly, AYUSH is not the same as allopathy. Just as I would not want allopathy people practicing AYUSH. Now, I am not saying Ayurveda is not helpful or good. It is and should be allowed to flourish and thrive (don't get me started on homeopathy. I feel and this is my personal opinion, it is absolute garbage. But to each their own). However, I do believe that these practices should be kept separate and should not be allowed to mix.

AYUSH practitioners practicing allopathy, performing unauthorized surgeries and even running ICU's is a big reason for the poor healthcare, especially critical healthcare in the country.

While we should be investing in training Trauma surgeons, intensivists for better emergency management and taking of the massive work burden off of the specialists so they can focus on OPD's we are legalizing quackery. Training paramedics and issuing proper well-equipped ambulances would be a much better use of resources, help massively in cutting down the number of deaths and even stimulate the automobile industry. But no. 

If we really wanted to eliminate quackery, we would have one national database for registration of doctors. The doctor's name, place of work and registration number would be available for people to see. Anyone could type that in and check whether the doctor is an actual licensd practitioner or not. Would not be that hard. 

However, as was said in the Parliamentary discussion "" **The content of the bill is directly opposed to the stated intent of the bill"".**

# 3. The Very Misunderstood NEXT exam.

A lot of people think that NEXT exam is a good thing and will improve the clinical skills of doctors because that is what the Anti-Health Minister Harshvardhan Sinha stated. However, this is a pure recipe to **destroy all clinical skills** in medicine for good

Understad that currently every single yearly exam for MBBS (1st prof, 2nd prof, 3rd prof and 4th prof) is conducted by the university. The exams consist of theory regarding mostly the most common diseases found, practicals and clinical case discussion. Note that the object of the exam is to reject people unworthy of practicing medicine (I am obviously not including the donation and capitation seats and the completely useless medical colleges)

On the other hand, NEET PG entrance asks about questions that have very less clinical value and often about stuff that is rare and theoretical. The object is to rank students and select a handful out of thousands for future courses. Success is largely dependent on one's ability to take coaching and capacity to memorize MCQ's.

NEXT proposes to merge the two. These two exams are polar opposites of each other. One cannot satisfy both criteria. 

Now, if one says that NEXT will have clinical exams. Then that poses a massive problem for PG entrance. First, it is **nearly impossible to conduct clinical exams** at such a massive scale at the same time. Next, **clinical exams are subjective.** This subjectivity poses massive problems for **PG competition entrance** which should be objective, especially when there can be as many as 200 candidates at the difference of a fraction of a mark in the exam. Note that practical examiners are prone to **biases** and generally being one of the minorities, women, people from lower socioeconomic status, religion or someone not liking your face can cause you to fail because of their **discrimination**. Universities tend to protect agaist this to some degree. However, without any university to intervene, **scandals** in exams will become even more rampant than NEET. 

Note that this exam will be necessary to gain your degree. If an **MBBS student fails** this exam, they will be **equivalent to +2**. The bill makes no mention of how many attempts candidates get for this exam. By the looks of it, students can take this only once. Chances of failing are very high the first time especially when the exam is designed to reject the majority of the people. This will **destroy the careers of students for good**. This is devastating when you consider the amount of time and money spent by students for MBBS. Many students have taken **loans**. This makes no sense when **the difficulty of the exam has nothing to do with what actually it takes to become a good doctor.** Meanwhile, nurses, ward boys and AYush are having a gala time. Note the level of difficulty for MBBS doctors who actually study the required subjects and the ease with which non-MBBS people will have in order to practice the same management.

On the other hand, **if** one says that there will be **no clinical exam**, then this will **decimate the clinical skills of doctors completely**. Already MBBS students are found more in the coaching classes than with patients. Why would anyone go to clinics?

Moreover, note that the **final year MBBS has 6-7 subjects**. While **PG entrance has 19 subjects**. If one says that only final year MBBS subjects will come in the exam, then how does one justify admission into non-final year subjects (MBBS teaches stuff like microbiology in 2nd year. However, PG is gained in microbiology only after clearing PG entrance.) Also, an overall knowledge of all subjects is required to become a good doctor, Preclinical knowledge (non final year subjects) is as important as clinical. This was precisely why just 2 years ago the govt proposed ro make it compulsory to pass (gain at least 50 percentile) in the NEET PG entrance exam to even practice as an MBBS doctor. That kind of a reform would make more sense. ( I am not here to  debate how NEET is not Clean, focus doctors, focus). To take admission in an engineering college one must have studied maths in +2. One does not get admission based on class 9th marks of maths while they have studied History and arts in +2.  Then why is PG entrance allowing for this?

On the other hand, final year degree examination (similar to 10th exam or passing +2 which can be done in any subject) comprises of only final year subjects. So if one follows the PG entrance pattern, how does one justify making someone study ALL the subjects?

The cherry on the cake is that all this has been done **without standardizing the medical syllabus.** So different universities have variations in what they teach. This is what allows some universities to be awesome, like AIIMS and PGI or even the whole state of Tamil Nadu's awesome colleges. But it also allows some colleges to be absolute garbage. However, since the universities have their own exams, the students have to qualify them based on what they learned. If one wants to conduct one exam, it is imperative that the syllabus and the books be standardized. Else it will not be fair. It would be like studying the table of 2 and being asked about the constitution of India. It makes no sense. We have already seen how badly NEET has affected TN and its medical education system. That will be the story for the whole country

[Edit: Moreover, it seems like it eliminates internship. Understand that Medical students need to pass 4th prof to do internship. They do internship and then take NEET as an Exit test to qualify and practice. Internship is the most important thing in the entire career of a doctor to gain clinical skills and get an all-round knowledge of healthcare. That is one year in between the final year and the NEET entrance. However, the bill has combined those two exams one year apart into one and nothing has been mentioned in the bill as to what will happen to the internship.] 

This will promote **coaching culture.** Coaching is the **termite** that has hollowed out the medical system in India. IMO, this poison should be exterminated for good. However, this bill gives it more power. Already if one has not taken coaching in a metropolitan or sub metropolitan city, cannot afford coaching or is rejected by coaching institutes or cannot access them, they have **very low chances** of getting into MBBS or PG entrance (unless you ave backchannels through dalals. But most of them work through coaching institutes anyway). Now, these students **will not even be able to gain a degree**. They will not be able to practice even as MBBS doctors. All the while, CHP can practice medicine after a 6-month course! If your intent is to increase the doctor-patient ratio, how does this make any sense?

# 4. Reservation for the rich

ote that Medical colleges, both for MBBS and PG, have ""regulated and unregulated seats"". Regulated seats are where the fees is regulated by the government. They are affordable for even lower middle income groups. The unregulated seats charge amounts that only the very rich can afford, (no, even upper middle class cannot usually afford it) The Anti health minister claimed that the NMC bill will regulate 50% seats. Sounds great. But it isn't. When you look at the current system, the central government and the state governments together regulate 75-85% of the seats. This is a net **drop from 85% to 50% in the affordable regulated seats.** The increase in unregulated seats has been called reservation for the rich as **universities decrease the minimum marks required for admission to accommodate students that pay more at the expense of more deserving candidates.** Medical education is slowly becoming less and less accessible to the common man. Note that the **less the access of medical education to the common man, the less is the access of healthcare to the common man.**

This is obviously to put more money in the pockets of the politicians and their cronies that own so many medical colleges across the country.

# 5. National Medical Omission Bill

Note that until now, there is a **set method** of maintaining **medical colleges**. There are **strict requirements** to open a medical college, maintain one (keep one open), to increase the available seats for students, etc. It makes sense because medical colleges **treat people and train future doctors**. It is imperative they have proper requirements to do so. For eg, one cannot become a surgeon is there is not an operation theatre (or enough tables in the operating theatre for students to learn on). Until now, this regulation was done by the MCI or the medical council of India.

Yes, the same one. However, recently MCU has been **closing down many medical colleges** across the country , even government colleges, as **the government has not provided appropriate funds to maintain the infrastructure.** I am not even going to start with private medical colleges (not talking about the few awesome ones) While the govt likes to brag about ""creation"" of new seats in medical colleges, they conveniently forget the seats lost due to lack of upkeep of existing medical colleges. Just **last year** about 2000 seats were created and about 3000 seats were lost. There was a **net loss of about 1000 medical seats.** But instead of spending money on the colleges, the govt decided to eliminate the body that shut down incompetent medical colleges. 

Now the colleges **do not need to be inspected. Inspection is optional and can be done after 4 years of the opening of medical college** \- at the time the first medical batch passes. What is to stop you or me from opening a **Trump University** like medical college, charge lakhs of rupees per student per year and then close the college after 3 years and then open another one? Absolutely nothing. This will destroy the careers of thousands of students per year. This will destroy their homes and lives (remember how much money these colleges will charge). Students will pay the fees, join coaching, and study and due to no fault of them, they will be left with no degree. Just like with generics, for medical colleges, there will be **no pragmatic way to tell reliable and unreliable ones apart** (except for a few ones). This is l**egalized conmaship. (420si)** Not to mention the money laundering hubs these paces will become.

Note that the old MCI head was in trouble for taking money to allow some sub-par medical colleges to function. So the solution is to remove ALL regulation from ALL medical colleges. What a cognitive dissonance sir jee.

This truly is the National Medical Omission Bill.

# 6. No more AIIMS, PGI?

Well,techncally they will still exist. You must know that AIIMS, PGI, JIPMER like institutes enjoy a **fairly autonomous status** and the **government** is **not able to interfere** in their working by and large. Correct me if I am wrong, but NMC bill **removes this autonomous status.** This autonomous status plays a great part in making these colleges hubs of learning and research, incredible studies and **institutes of excellence.** This will be a massive blow to their functioning and will reflect in the quality of their care and research. I have no explanation as to why the govt would want to do this.

Another point is that these institutes have PG exams twice a year. However, under NEXT, that will be reduced to once a year. This will cause droppers to lose an entire year instead of months. 

# 7. Replacing MCI with worse.

So we have all heard about the corruption stories of MCI. No one is defending the MCI here. However, this bill does away with the MCI and replaces it with the national Medical commission. This will consist of all government appointees so they will be pretty much like Niti Ayog. What is amazing is that the **medical community gets nearly no representation** in the NMC. Ask yourselves about how much you know about the medical system and how it works (non-medicos obviously). That is exactly how much these people will know. And they are supposed to make decisions about medical education and healthcare. Imagine handing plutonium to a monkey. That would be safer.

Now, there has been many proposals to fix the MCI problem. I liked the one where MCI would be elected and the members would be on partial terms like Rajya Sabha. Their functions would be the same as the old MCI. To control the corruption, one could have ahd oversight by a National Health Comittee with represenation of govt and medical communty; Kind of how it works in Germany. This may not be the best solution but this is one of the scores of solution sthat were better than the NMC.

The state of economy that we see today will be the state of healthcare very soon because it will be managed by similar people.

&amp;#x200B;

# 8. Barely any State Representation

The NMC has a structure where states get rotational representattion. Which means a **state**, especially smaller stated that need more **representation** will get a chance to be on the committee **after as much as 12 years**! After slight dissent from the (non) opposition, this rotation was changed so that states could get representation a little sooner, However, even that is pretty vague. So obviouly state interests are not protected.

&amp;#x200B;

# 9. Too much power

The NMC has too much power. Even **MCI** inspected the colleges and provided guidelines over the medical syllabus, it **did not fix fees, decide new branches** unilaterally **or have complete control over exams**. NMC has all that and more. **The definition of the powers and purpose is so vague that it is meaningless.** They could do anything and it would be binding. 

Moreover,  **the decision of the center in all matters is final.**  so the center could issue a fatwah on anything in complete opposition of the opinion of the entire medical community, all the states, all professions involved (like this bill) and everyone will have to follow it no matter how senseless or harmful. This is total dictatorship and seeing the past few decisions regarding healthcare, will be devastating!

Policy/Economy,"Big wedding, bigger government",
Policy/Economy,Consumers thinking twice before buying a Rs 5 pack: Britannia,
Policy/Economy,My experience with the answers of Quora on Government,"Before 2014 I was a daily user of quora but once they started there selfless work of promoting government for each and everything and when the crowd of wannabe top writer started throwing senseless answers on stupid question after taking weed. I was forced to quit. But I didn't unsubscribe from Quora digest.

Every alternate week I see there is a question on work related to government in Quora digest. And despite knowing what kind of answer it is going to have 7 out of 10 times, I try to read that. 
I have seen it all from giving them a little bit of time to proving how good demonetization was. 

There is usually a pattern in answers if the question is normal one like, how Modi is performing in his constituency then typically top response have this pattern. 
First, he will put a discloser why he eligible for giving this answer it could be, the writer himself belongs to the same constituency to he visited this place twice, one before 2014 and one after 2014. After that discloser,  couple of pictures from Varanasi in the night from the perfect angle where you can't see the filth. And with that, he will assure you that   Varanasi is literally transformed into a world-class city. Despite the well-known fact that Varanasi is not just restricted to Ghats of Ganga rest of the answer will focus on that, and there will be a rosy picture in front of you. The list put in front of you will mostly a daily news article like Modi gave a gift of x crore to Varanasi and there was a project that started only by great leader etc. Now, what would you expect from a guy who lives there is to put a picture of how his life is changed like electricity, roads and healthcare facility, he is getting after 2014, but no I will throw every random project news about Varanasi without the follow up on that project. Are bahi! ager news article ki project started or gifted vali news headline hi padhni thi to question kyu puchta. 

Another instance if the question is about the health of the economy or something like demonetization. Where people are vocal means, there is less excuse to make. Then ignoring all the facts on how government changed his stance from the attack on black money to increasing cashless transaction. The writer will simply put forward his own theory or a new theory produced by Sir Sambit Patra. One of the theory was now the government have a big database of people who submitted their money it will be easy peasy Japanesey to find defaulters. In the end, there will be some statement from hotshot banking firm head backing their theory and proving how India is headed toward glorious future. Despite the well-known fact how crores of money renewed through bank staff as well as through traveling agencies, daily wage workers, and jan dhan account.  

There are some instances where they pull legs on failed policies like make in India and poor river health but don't know how they forget the name of our beloved PM and his party in that answer. It's all about how bad Indian citizen then. If river Ganga is still filthy then only people are responsible about that because they throw religious material in it. But they closed eyes when Mr. Modi along with his fellas dropped religious stuff in the river during the live telecast of Narmada dam inauguration. 

Justification on how it is just cow cow and cow everywhere is simply it is not new, and it is going on from ages. It was Nehru who started all this. And our beloved leader is so good he never question his elders work. Then why would he question work of Chacha Nehru? He is just following his footstep.

Justification on why farmers are dying and rape is a big problem is again it is not new, and the X country is actually a top-ranked country in this. Just don't dare to question our leader.
One of the top writer and flag bearer of Indian diaspora on Quora said something amazing when asked why they act like the lawyer of government. 

> For the same reason Sachin, Steve Jobs and a variety of people are staunchly defended by their fans. You might not have agreed with every one of Sachin’s shots [especially the silly shots he got out] but would desert him for that?
Modi was elected by crores of voters. Some of these might have voted because they thought there is no alternative. But, there is a sizeable chunk of voters who voted because they believed. They believe this government is theirs and not some random entity like we have often behaved in the past.
If you assume Modi’s string of victories in state elections is a fluke and that a sizeable chunk of people don’t truly adore him, you don’t understand the evolving Indian politics.
In a way this is democracy - where people feel ownership in the government. Look at US politics and the same happens - where common people feel ownership and stake in politics and fight for their ideology.
When you believe it is yours, you will fight for it. 

Yeah, I will fight for it, and I will fight for every single penny I gave through tax and different types of cess. And question government why things don't change instead of supporting them for each and every idiotic move."

Policy/Economy,"A Tale of Rogue Pirates, Ashok Kumars and ISPs caught in the middle: RTI data on court ordered website blocking reveals worrying trends #WhatTheBlock"," 

https://i.redd.it/0e8et2q1km931.png

### Highlights

* **Background:** As per RTI data from BSNL, 31 cases over two years led to the blocking of more than 4000 websites in India. Most of the cases involve allegations of copyright infringement related to movies. We are making a copy of this response with the text of these orders available. BSNL has only revealed court orders but refuses to provide any directions received from the Central Government for blocking of websites and we will be filing an appeal with the CIC regarding denial of this information.
* **Lack of Due Process:** Our analysis of the court orders reveals four disturbing trends. First, the court orders permit blocking of the entire website, and not just specific URLs which host IP infringing content. Second, courts have passed the buck to ISPs to determine whether blocking websites listed by the plaintiff is necessary to prevent copyright infringement without independently verifying if these websites host infringing content. Third, interim injunctions are granted to block access to websites without providing the website owner an opportunity of being heard. Finally, Ashok Kumar orders which were intended to gather evidence against unnamed defendants are being misused for website blocking.

### Perseverance Pays Off (Partly)

After a long drawn process, BSNL has provided IFF access to court orders directing blocking of websites in 2017 and 2018. We had filed two RTI applications with BSNL on 6 March 2019 seeking information about website blocking orders issued by the Central Government and different courts. Both RTI applications were initially rejected by citing the existence of a fiduciary relationship under Section 8(1)(e) and threat to life and safety of a person under Section 8(1)(g) of the Right to Information Act, 2005. We appealed the rejection of our RTI requests, and we were partly successful because BSNL agreed to provide us access to court orders. However, it has refused to disclose website blocking orders issued by the Central Government and we intend to challenge this before the Central Information Commission (CIC) soon.

### Anatomy of a Website Blocking Court Order

We were provided access to 31 court orders in total. Out of these, 25 orders were passed by the Madras High Court and the remaining 7 orders were passed by the Delhi High Court. Almost all the court orders relate to unlicensed streaming of copyrighted films, TV shows or sports events on websites such as 123 Movies, Pirate Bay, Put Locker, Torrent etc. Approximately 3000-4000 websites were blocked by each order but there is significant overlap in the websites mentioned by different orders.

&amp;#x200B;

We analysed all 31 court orders and discovered four disturbing trends.

***(i) Whole websites, and not specific URLs are being blocked***  
All court orders relating to copyright infringement permit blocking of the whole website, and they do not limit suspension of access to specific URLs which host infringing content. The list of websites is prepared by the plaintiff with the help of paid investigative agencies and it is accepted by the court without any independent scrutiny.  
A notable exception to this trend of blocking whole websites is present in the solitary court order relating to trademark infringement which directs blocking of specific URLs selling infringing products on E-Commerce platforms like Amazon, Flipkart and Snapdeal. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine a scenario where a court would mechanically block access to the whole website of a multi billion dollar giant like Amazon. Unfortunately, file sharing platforms like Torrent which have been characterized as rogue pirates do not receive the same level of consideration.

***(ii) ISPs forced to be Judge, Jury and Executioner***  
Most court orders passed by the Madras High Court put ISPs in a tough spot because they are directed to block websites listed by the plaintiff if it is necessary to prevent copyright infringement. This is unacceptable because ISPs are not capable of making such decisions which require application of judicial mind. Whether blocking a website is necessary to prevent copyright infringement will require the ISP to evaluate the genuineness and imminence of the threat vis a vis each website. Since ISPs do not want to waste their resources on individually verifying whether infringing content exists on the thousands of websites listed by the plaintiff, they will err on the side of caution and block access to everything.  Further, there are several exceptions to copyright infringement such as fair use for educational purposes or criticism, and ISPs cannot be expected to balance competing interests to determine if the exception is applicable.

***(iii) Ex-parte orders are undermining the adversarial basis of our justice system***  
Out of 31 orders in total, 21 orders were passed without any of the defendants or their representatives present. Therefore, there was nobody present during the hearing who could challenge the plaintiff’s version. This is deeply problematic because our justice system follows an adversarial model which believes in discovering the truth through contestation between opposing parties. In the cases before the Delhi High Court, there were four types of defendants: owners of  named websites which are known to host copyright infringing content, owners of unnamed websites which may be hosting copyright infringing content but their identity is not currently known, ISPs and government bodies like Department of Telecom. However, plaintiffs who had filed their copyright infringement suits before the Madras High Court only impleaded ISPs as defendants. This means that owners of websites which are being blocked have not even been brought on record or served notice. If only ISPs are impleaded as defendants, then it is not a genuinely adversarial proceeding because as previously noted, ISPs are business entities which would prefer to err on the side of caution and they will not fight for website owners.

***(iv) Ashok Kumar orders being misutilized for website blocking***  
For everyone who isn’t an intellectual property lawyer, an Ashok Kumar order is a court order which restrains a class of persons whose identity is not yet known from infringing the plaintiff’s rights. These orders are called John Doe orders abroad.

The difference between John Doe orders and website blocking orders has been explained by [**Ananth Padmanabhan writing for CIS**](https://cis-india.org/a2k/blogs/john-doe-orders-isp-blocking-websites-copyright-1):

&gt;*“The most crucial point of distinction between these two types of orders is that while John Doe orders speak to the primary infringer, website blocking orders impose onerous responsibility on the ISP. John Doe orders as used in India thus far have served the purpose of a blanket search and seize mandate to gather evidence of direct infringement. As seen above, the final relief in the suit is granted only against those John Does who are subsequently identified and arrayed as parties to the main suit. Website blocking orders, on the other hand, amount to granting the final relief at the interim stage itself, as access is blocked to web links hosted by unknown persons by taking recourse to the ISP.”*

In some of the court orders that we analysed, the judges have failed to appreciate this distinction, and they have put the cart before the horse by directing the ISPs to block access to any infringing website upon receiving notice of the same from the plaintiff. The ISPs are required to block access even if the owner of the website was not impleaded as a named defendant or mentioned in the list of websites provided by the plaintiff to the court.

### Need for due process and proportionate solutions

On our blog, we have previously written about problems in the website blocking process under the IT Blocking Rules. Most recently, we discussed this issue in the context of [**blocking of the satirical Dowry Calculator website**](https://internetfreedom.in/blocking-of-satirical-dowry-calculator-website-prompts-us-to-take-action-whattheblock-savetheinternet/) for which we had also filed an RTI.

Our analysis of the court orders supplied by BSNL reveals that even when websites are blocked by the judiciary, there is a lack of due process and natural justice. Website owners are not given notice or hearing before grant of interim injunctions. Further, court ordered website blocking is disproportionately broad because it is not limited to specific URLs which host infringing content. File sharing platforms also host legitimate content and cutting off access to the entire website is akin to throwing the baby out with the bathwater.

The most troubling trend is the concentration of power in the hands of ISPs who are expected to block websites which may or may not be mentioned in the plaint based on whether it is ""necessary"" to prevent infringement. This means that our fundamental right to free speech which is guaranteed by Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution is left at the mercy of overly cautious and business minded ISPs. As internet users, we are often left wondering why certain websites have been blocked because the notices displayed are cryptic and inconsistent, and they do not disclose reasons for suspension of access. This lack of transparency directly impacts our right to receive information which is also a part of Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution.

Filing RTIs has been an important part of IFF’s strategy to unearth information which concretely demonstrates lack of due process and transparency in the website blocking process. If you have ideas about other RTIs we should file, write to us!

Policy/Economy,Blind boomer analogy in India - We are the real boomers,"With the ""OK Boomer"" memes becoming popular, I've noticed a lot of Indians blindly picking up American boomer arguments and using it in Indian context. The arguments go something to the tune of - you had the best of times, the best jobs, social security, economic growth and are now becoming an impediment to education subsidies and liberal policies that will benefit the present youth.

In the Indian context, these arguments are only partially true. Firstly, the word boomer refers to baby boomers generation born post WW-II (1946-1964). This was the period where the great health-care became accessible to everyone in developed nations and the child mortality dropped fast. However, the birth-rates remained relatively high (though decreasing) and this led to high number of kids being born. This was the golden period of American growth - women and boomers then joined labor force and there was a great productivity rise in labor. Middle-class grew and moved to sub-urbs and could live that idylic existence with benefits of big cities as well as countryside. Boomers led a positive existence - not just that, because the birth-rates decreased subsequently, boomers also had disproportionate power as a voting block (which was bolstered by the fact that the voting % in boomers is much higher than in subsequent generations too). So, they could bring about and keep laws which were in line with their values but were old-fashioned according to their successors. Moreover, older people living on savings hate increase in inflation that comes with debt-fueled government spendings. So, it was natural for this generation to be debt hawks which also meant opposition to subsidies which led to rise in education debt amongst younger generation.Hence, it is a legitimate cause of angst for politically savvy young people who are forced to live in a society controlled by the oldies who support arcane laws (against abortion for instance) and go against their benefits (education subsidies).

However, India has a completely different demographic profile. Purely, in terms of being the largest generation, we are the boomers of India. We were born around or just before the high growth post-liberalization India, have opportunities (in terms of private sector jobs, access to information) that the older generation did not have (boomers had booming economy whereas their parents had depression and war). Even as a political block, the young people have the biggest electoral power amongst all generations (a power that was partially harnessed by BJP when they won two elections). Moreover, with the dropping birth-rates in India, we would also grow old in an era of depressed population growth where we continue to be the most influential generation - just like the boomers!

However, it is also true that the older generation is more bigoted, religiously/caste-wise minded than us and have a role in morally bankrupt polity in this country. There is some blame that we can certainly lay on the older generation. But, the whole boomer spiel of the west wherein the millennial generation claims that the boomers had a much better life and are now actively spoiling the present and future of current youth is certainly not applicable here. Our parents' generation had a life of scarcity in terms of resources and opportunities. Even if you are not interested in reading history or talking to your parents, just watch movies - heroes or characters who were struggling to find work, were getting rejected because they could not pay bribes were part of every story. Apart from government jobs, any city apart from tier-I had little to no opportunities in the license-raj era. Statistically, there was lower economic growth and more poverty.

To see the claims about the older generation led a great life is ridiculous. However, it is true that the young need to break free of the religious and caste fundamentalism that the older generation were a victim of due to their lack of exposure and programming."

AskIndia,Can someone shed some perspective on the movie Arjun Reddy's fame?,"SPOILERS ALERT. DON'T READ IF YOU HAVE NOT WATCHED ARJUN REDDY AND PLAN TO WATCH IT

I recently watched the movie on prime. It's probably the only other telugu movie I've watched since Bahubali. And safe to say, I'm traumatized. 

He is an abuser. In the name of anger, he almost rapes a girl in the beginning. He threatens her at knife point. He almost throws a flower pot at the lead's sister. The way he lashes in anger at his girlfriend and everyone else and never apologizes is shocking. 

The girl is controlled. Right from the moment she steps into the college, he controls who she can speak with. He gives advice along the lines of ""make a fat friend so you get noticed more"" (He also scolds someone else for OBJECTIFYING WOMEN????) Okay, they get into a relationship properly. But then, all I know about Preethi is that she loves Arjun Reddy. That's all. That's all is there to her character. 

After he whores around whilst having a broken heart, he is forgiven, his anger issues are not tackled, he gets back with the girl, and they live happily ever after???  A fitting end would have been his downfall, as it should be. 

The abuse was handled so so so so so badly. He recovers in a day??? He does as he pleases, goes to no therapy, and everything is okay because he is brilliant? 

Also, the blatant casteism.  ""I curse you to marry a Tulu guy"",  just because what he wanted didn't happen? "" I will make her mine"".  That is not love. That is a sign of a disturbed, controlling, abusive guy. He needs jail or therapy.

Okay, apparently this movie has shown kissing and pre marital sex and is ""PROGRESSIVE"". BUT IT IS SO GODDAMN painful to watch. I cannot stand the abuse. The moment he went all "" pants only, no need of top"" in the beginning, I felt it. What the hell is this script? 

And why is such behavior NORMALISED in the name of LOVE of all things? 

Can someone shed some perspective on why this crap is being remade in hindi????"
AskIndia,Need help regarding JEE mains and if I should take drop for next year. (posted on Indian Academia also)," 

I'm back!

So  a while back I posted here and wanted your opinions regarding some  (weak) circumstances but anyways I had a change in decision.

I've  decided to take drop and try for jee mains in January and April again next year even tho I haven't scored enough in boards(64% aggregate,  54.9% in pcm) for iits/nits/iiits but am still eligible for decent engineering colleges like:-

DTU, New Delhi (through jee mains+ JAC)

COEP, pune (through MHT-CET)

RVCE, Bangalore (through COMED-K)

VJTI, mumbai (through MHT-CET/JEE MAINS + DTE COUNSELING)

DAIICT, GUJRAT (through jee mains)

and everyone's  fav MIT,Manipal (through MU-OET).

Now  my parents want to (and I mean really in a very toxic manner) send me to a local shitty private engineering college(where ofcourse uniform and 75% attendance is mandatory), and prepare myself for coding independantly(lol) because a relative of mine (who is from iit-kharagpur ofc) told them to, and then do masters from some US college(which won't  happen if I join said shitty college for Btech). And I really want to  have a decent job after my bachelor's before I decide my further education,atleast for a while.

The thing is I want to enjoy my college life(I guess?) a bit and actually have a decent chance at good job prospects in the future, plus I'm still a bit unsure whether chasing engineering would be a good idea for a lazy student like me but hell I can do something my parents wish for me to do. Also will try my hand at IELTS and reach for foreign colleges in  europe (less expensive than US and Australia), tho that seems unlikely since my parents are unwilling in that matter.

So  fellow redditors, please give me some insights/opinions on whether I'm making a sound decision or not,and if yes, how shall I prepare for JEE MAINS since I haven't touched a book for months and really have not much guidance as of now. I would also like to know if preparation for JEE would be enough for other entrance examinations like MUOET, COMED-K, etc.  Also I would really like to self study and avoid coachings (never could use them to an advantage), and amount of books shouldn't be a problem. I'm also weak in chemistry and my math concepts (a majority of them) are  terribly fucked. I'm willing to put in the hours tho promise (even tho I'm prone to mood swings and demotivation, but my career is on the line, hell my life is). I'm 17 and just passed my boards this year if it matters. So PLEASE help me and thank you for your suggestions.

Sorry for the formatting as I typed this on the mobile app, and also I meant no offence to anyone going to any engineering college, it's just my elder friends really warned me about their situation and they were Frank af  with me so I thought the wording shouldn't be very offensive, but if it is I'm really sorry, and thanks again:)

Edit: by eligible I meant my board Marks are enough for mentioned colleges and that I need to improve my jee rank (hence why I wanted to take a drop). I'm not actually eligible for iits/nits/bits etc. Due to low percentage in board exams. Hope it clears the confusion."
AskIndia,Is dowry the woman's inheritance from her family? Or are those two different things?,"I am against dowry as in ""it's something given to the boy or boy's family"" during the wedding. My question is, is dowry considered as inheritance from her family wealth or is it extra over the inheritance?

Say a family has got 3 acres of land and has got 2 boys and 1 girl. Each acre will be given to each child. Will this 1 acre be considered the dowry, or will dowry be something else plus the 1 acre of inheritance?

I think it's only fair that each child despite the sex get equal share of the family wealth if parents are into sharing it among the sons and daughters. In that case, dowry seems fine as long as it goes to and stays with the daughter."

Would love to hear from you guys. My notes on the original book are given below. Looking forward to your comments and suggestions and experiences and anything else you feel like talking about based on the summary/notes of the book I have provided below...

-------

""Letters To My Ex"" is a book by Nikita Singh, about a girl who runs away from her own engagement ceremony. She was supposed to be engaged and married to her own long time boyfriend but yet, she just freaked out and run away. She does not talk to anyone after that, and ten months in, she confesses to the boyfriend that she still loves him and makes him swear that he will do everything to earn her trust everyday henceforth.

I think it is a slightly less intellectual equivalent of ""Notes From The Underground"" (Men are Not Piano Keys) fame. The format is the same. Notes from the underground has notes, letters has letters. They are both viciously funny and about characters that are absolutely abominable.

Anyways, I started out writing my own response to the girl from the book and plan to publish it as a book of my own introducing concepts from neuroscience and philosophy and conflict resolution and the likes.

The original book is located here: 

https://www.amazon.in/Letters-My-Ex-Nikita-Singh-ebook/dp/B07938VDLS/ref=sr_1_2_twi_kin_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1535473766&sr=1-2&keywords=letters+to+my+ex

-----------------------------

These are my notes:

# On the Book

This books is about two people who met in college, were going to be married, but the woman ran away from the middle of the engagement ceremony and then they are again engaged.

As the author states, something essential connects them. This is very easy. They are connected by deformed ideas of love and a shared identity that they could not shed.

She panics because she does not discuss her problems and her idea of her future melts away right in front of her. And thereafter she does arbitrary things, does not communicate to anyone and when she meets her boyfriend and takes a look at him having moved on she falls in love with him again. And even he falls in love with her, again, because that desire motivates. And then he is self absorbed in his own way about her. And the girlfriend has no control over him. 

# January 
There's a lot of talk about the reactions she gets when she breaks off the marriage. Dad is confused, mom is angry and both of them are disappointed. Which brings in the next point. She is really, really confused at how she ended up being the disappointing one because she is not the one that disappoints, ever. Because she always behaved like the perfect daughter. And who is the perfect daughter? She does not know, she has an image in mind and she maintains it.

Then we get to see her first meet. What we realize is that she is reads a lot and she did not have time for appearances. She is a thinker. But she thinks a lot. Really. But does not have an internal discipline of truth maintenance. She falls in love with a legend. He is a cricketer. She has heard of him, and he cannot be controlled, can not be tamed, so she gets insecure around him and does not know how to behave. And she tries and dominate him, ""Do you like being ignored?""  Rolls her eyes!

And then there is the scene in which she breaks off her engagement. She runs away in the middle of it all because stress has been building up. And there after, she just starts thinking and feeling sad and keeping her thoughts to herself and being disappointed by life in general. She thinks that this is all turning out to be like other unhappy, sad, emotionless, married couples. And so the idea just freaks her out. And so she does not control and run away. Even in the middle of it, she wants him to come back to her, and run to save her. She is running away, but instead of thinking what she has done to him, she really wants him to come get her back. So. How. How in the world is it possible?

# February 
From a lot of the discussion it is somewhat apparent that she resented the involvement of her family into her life. There is some psychological projection involved as well. Their families are trying to conduct the affairs the way that they know is best. But after all this involvement, Needhi realizes this is not what she had in her mind. Which is to say, she had an idyllic vision of marriage in her head and the world just did not figure into that. So when that image broke, she did not understand what to do about it. The more the image changed, the sadder she got. None of this, she talked with anyone else.  


There is the theme of their careers too. Abhay joined the family business while Needhi did not know what to do with her life. Both are probably liberal arts students, but this is what attracted them to each other - their differences. Abhay is a cricketer and then works with family business. So both require team work while Needhi is a more independent person. This is the kind of person who would do something innovative when she grows up. The problem with Needhi is that she does not grow up. Even Abhay has a few problems to deal with, but since all he has to do is follow the rules it never becomes apparent that he is also immature. Now, major points are that Abhay is self assured and traditional, teamplayer while Needhi is open to new experiences, independent and a thoughtful person of a more gentle demeanour.


Yes, there it is. She has existential problems in life. Who am I? Why am I here? What am I doing? What is my purpose in life? What will bring me happiness? All good questions to ask, and answer, this is a worthy pursuit. Here, she is incompetent. That is the problem. She says she wants a weaker memory and that she wants to be less of a control freak. That is, she remembers every little thing without being able to let go, and even control is also an inability to let go. She has no concept of where her independence ends and where the world begins. She even blames Abhay for not loving her enough or stopping to love him, and this is after she breaks the engagement. So the problem that led to the freaking out at the engagement is being discussed two months after the engagement and it was someone else's fault. In fact, she blames it on him that he did not try to stop her when she was running away even though she wanted him to stop her and this is further proof that he had stopped loving her and she was angry when she was running away that she was not stopping her.

# March

This is where Abhay eMails her. And within this email we get to know one thing, she never picks up his calls. She does accept that this is cowardice, but this needs to be explored. Why does she not pick up calls? Why does she not respond to texts? Why does she respond to him now? This is probably because he was confrontational and formal and he asked her point blank. Why did she do what she did? And then she responds to him. Maybe partially because she loves him and that she never saw him this way. But she responds to him that there was a loss of feeling and that she was a coward not to return calls or texts. And that is there. So. Once the self absorbed image breaks down she starts to feel a distance. This would be repaired only through creative engagement with stress.

She has wrecked her brains but has no answer to his questions: why did she do it. However, Abhay talks about something that hints at her avoidance. She avoids calls. She avoids confrontation. She avoids meeting with Abhay when he is with some other girl and then she avoids getting into engagement. Needhi avoids everything. Needhi has a void inside her after all this avoiding.

Needhi has no answers regarding anything, but Abhay has a very concrete event that precipitated a change in the feelings: when Anamika kissed Abhay and he did not stop. Again, this hints at his lack of self regulation. There are two components: the meaning of the event and the pleasure of the event. Both are controlled by different subsytems in the brain. And this meant that he would not stop the kiss and go with the flow. This created dissonance in her head and wrecked everything apart. They decide to meet, why is that so? This is probably because they had a heart to heart and treated each other with their intimate thoughts so something built up. 

# April
The first thing that jumps out at us is how he just avoids all kind of conversation about the topics that matter. She just does not talk about things that matter to her, to the point that Abhay has to say that he will not accept that ""I don't know"" answer. So all this stupidity for three months? Just so that she could avoid facing uncomfortable situations. In the end she faced an uncomfortable situation because something in her was awakened by a conversation with Abhay. They talked. They talked about what was bothering them and so a little bit of love happened.

She talks about things that make her uncomfortable and gets very emotional, but absolutely refuses to discuss things, because she says there is no point. What she does not realize is that there has to be a point, of answering the question, ""Where do we go from here""? So she keeps ruminating, discussing and talking the same things again and again but she does not know what to do with the discussion. She does not have basic conflict resolution skills. All of this is just her feelings, but she herself does not know what to do with the feelings. 

After having two discussions, one in March and the other in April, about things that she did, she feels a little better. This is because things have moved further and Abhay has discussed and imposed his constraints. Needhi did not accept even to herself that Anamika's kiss had affected her. Which is why this was buried deep down in her psyche and the memories came back later when it was discussed. This is one of those things, she feels that if she does not talk about things then they will go away.

# May
May is her Tinder month. Here she meets three people. The first one is someone who genuinely cares for her, sees her confused and intimidated and guides her through the process. The only mistake he makes is that he does not ask her, but just goes on telling her about what he genuinely thinks is helpful. She feels he is imposing himself on her. And so she does not like it. Then she is surprised that he enjoyed himself and had a good time with her. She ghosts him.

Then there is the MNC guy who is really high up. She is really fascinated by all the work that he does and she really enjoys all the discussion. Now this could have been her ticket up, but even here she makes the mistake that she is doing nothing. She just talks about things, not about herself. This is ofcourse, the same mistake that every one makes, which is the presentation of an image to another person who is presenting an image while you have all these thoughts. All she had to say is, oh god this is so exciting and then all hell would have broken lose.

Then there is Dhruv. Perfect guy again. Does everything. Even stops calling her when she tells him not to. He is perfect in every way but she does not feel the spark. And how is one supposed to feel the spark. Talk! Dhruv, you are such a wonderful person. Oh my God. This is so amazing. Haha! And then he says something. And she talks about her own marriage. And he comforts her and they lean in. And that's that. 

# June
They have a chat in June where they start discussing some things and behave as if things are normal, or near normal. Abhay is chatting with her simply because there is a wedding coming up and he will be there with a girlfriend. Needhi takes the opportunity to give him a chance to have a conversation with her about her life. Now, the two of them have an understanding here that if one talks about her problems, she will simply not have to worry about coming across as weak. In fact that is a signal to come closer. She calls it breaking the ice. She could do the same with other people, but she does not.

She is talking about her coworkers, but she is fairly self obsessed. She has no ability to talk to other people and presents her interpretation of events rather than talk about actual facts.

There is all this talk about awkwardness, which basically makes me think, what the hell? Where is the maturity? Talk about the elephant in the room.

#July 
The one thing that stands out in all of this is Needhi's need not to have awkwardness. Awkwardness is assuming some convention, adhering to it, needing to maintain that and pretending nothing happens outside of that script. For all of Needhi's talk of her famillies adhering to some script, even this one is adherence to a script. Just the one that she chooses. She feels awkwardness, she has to be non chalant yet friendly and still not have to overcompensate. She just can not feel easy, until alcohol comes and solves the problem. Bekhuudi. A disinhibited state. Jaam ki zaroorat, hai jaise, bekhoodi ke liyey, bas ek sanam chahiyey, aashiqui ke liyey!

Needhi's friend confronts her about this and they have a conversation on whether they have really moved on or not. And then, she pushes and pulls. Slowly. She says they have moved on, then maybe they are pretending to have moved on. There is this issue, of imposing an image and pretending that things are a certain way when they themselves don't know how things already are!

Then finally it happens. They both see each other in their prime. Abhay is non challant about everything, because, of course, he has a girlfriend. Needhi becomes vulnerable, partly because she is already in a weakned state because her identity has been broken while Abhay is already there. So she is hungry and in awe of Abhay. And there he is. Non challant! As she says. And so she is weak and beautiful. Abhay takes a look at her and his primal love is reactivated. And she thinks this is love, which partially it is.

# August
She has a mix of depression, anxiety and fever by now. She thinks she was moving on, but then again, she does not move on. The body is different from her self image.  She says she wants to do something, but the body just does not respond. Of course it won't. This is textbook creative stress. Change will not happen in such a manner. And that is the point, she has to confront everything. And had Abhay never really gotten back to her, she would have had to move on and deal with everything, but no, that is not how it happens.

Abhay talks about being distant from his girlfriend. What is going on is that his mind has been occupied by Needhi. Simran is automatically put in the backseat. He keeps on blabbering about how he gave all of him to her but that was not enough, and that introduces us to a new concept. What do you mean giving it his all? So, that is one thing.

She felt better when she had run away, temporarily. But now she is devastated. There she had to confront the fact that life would not be like she imagined it to be so she freaked out. Now she has to confront the fact that she still loves Abhay and she does not have him in her life and so she freaks out again. And this time it is major, because she has to do something. But then, she gets it all without doing anything. She is basically a slave to her feelings. Later on we find out that what she just blurts out everything to him. That is all that she does.

# September
She is reminiscing about their times together. Needhi freaks out always because she has no endgame in mind and when Abhay scolds her or tutors her or lectures her she gets defensive. But the point is that she is reminiscing. All the good memories are coming back.

She admits that they never had any such problems at the time. Why? Because they had nothing to do, really. All they had to do was be in love and enjoy the feeling and keep performing the same identity.

The one thing that I keep missing out on here is that she is doing really badly in her career too. She does not have her shit together. This is form an existential standpoint and also the fact that she has no identity to work from. This is precisely what ego does, it does not settle, it does not sacrifice. It does not know what to do.

# October
She finally gives in. First there is the rumination. She finds a hundred reasons for them not to be together and then she finds a hundred reasons for them to be together.

Trust comes up over and over again. They have trust issues, yes, of course they will have because they are both unable to deal with anything, they have no binding reality and they act on their whims. 

Even though she has been making Abhay dance all over her tune, she blames him for kissing Anamika and precipitating this. She takes no note of the fact that she did not want to deal with it and suppressed the memory.

# November
Abhay is clearly still in love with her, but he is also torn apart. He is completely broken. She just left without an explanation, on a whim without doing anything really to be responsible towards Abhay. So he wants her but he tells her that he cannot trust her and she has to have made a good decision that she is fully in. They do not know what a decision is.

Abhay is made to feel guilty and he is already being manipulated by her unknowingly because he is making the promise that he is going to wake up every day trying to gain her trust. So now we know that they do not have any idea on how trust emerges either. The more important part is that Needhi has a very bad effect on Abhay and the children do not discuss this with their parents or other responsible adults.

Their idea of moving past trauma is to forget it, which is really bad. Cheating and abandoning. Well. What the fuck. Really. Also, I promise to be yours if you promise to be mine. Mine and yours. Also. What the fuck. Conditional love. It's not conditional, it's a contract.

# December
She feels 19 again.

They have a set of promises one is about playing devil's advocate.

They are marrying, but then since they have not had any commitments here, no concept and no growth what is going on is that they will break up again, brutally. And that is why this is a viciously funny book if you know what the fuck is going on. She breaks up with him and then tells him to marry him again and now they are going to marry each other without changing anything. So what happened, really? Nothing! This almost reads like an episode of Sillicon Valley.

AskIndia,Serious: Advice with employer 'Show Cause Notice',"My sister has been working in a really hostile and negative work environment for over a year in Mumbai. Her boss has screamed at her in front of her colleagues and a senior manager has made several sexual advances that she has avoided. Recently she got employed at another location and put in her resignation to serve her notice period.

As soon as she put in her notice, the company executives sent her a 'Show Cause Notice.' In my opinion the 'show cause' notice does not have any concrete evidence to support any of the claims the management has made to terminate her. By concrete I mean, an email or an audio/video recording that is supporting evidence. It's all hearsay stuff. Here is a snapshot of what they wrote in the notice:

*""It has been brought to our notice that you have engaged in inappropriate behavior at the workplace, following concerns have been highlighted:*

*- Inappropriate and unwarranted discussions with colleagues to defame and demean your supervisor,*

*- Impacting the overall wellbeing of the department by creating a negative and hostile environment,*

*- unprofessional behavior as a team member.""*

My sister is really stressed  and does not know what to do. She has to respond to the notice.

Any advice you can provide based on your experience or expertise will be much appreciated.

AskIndia,What are your thoughts on Zomato Gold's Infinity Dining offer?,"For the uninitiated, it's a new scheme launched by Zomato, for exclusively its Gold members, which allows you to sample the entire menu of a restaurant [Food (barring some imported products) +non-alcoholic drinks] at a fixed price. Think of it as a buffet of sorts.

I was excited initially, and was actually thinking abt sampling some of the restaurants here, but the prices seem a bit steep for me, 1000 bucks for 1 person for the ones I wanna visit. Also, there's a distinction between imported meats (which you can't order) and the rest of the meats. 

At best, I think this scheme is suited for really high end restaurants, whose dishes are expensive enough to buy a slot and taste them out. 

Of course if you're a fan of non-alcoholic drinks, freakshakes and whatnot, you're in for a treat bcoz all that is covered in the cover charges. (entire menu!
) 


Also, looks like a lot of food is gonna get wasted this way. No doggy bags here either. People are just gonna order on whim and throw away the remaining food. 

What do you think?

In the light of some selfish thoughts, here's my zomato Gold code - use it to avail 20% off on Zomato Gold memberships, which can be used to avail Infinity Dining.

AskIndia,Who do you think is right in #LogOut campaign?

More on the campaign [here](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/restaurants-decide-to-pull-out-of-dining-apps-that-offer-deals-1565792728714.html)

So for those who haven't heard about it, the restaurants via their association ""National Restaurants Association of India""(NRAI) have broadly faced following issues.

1) The zomato gold deep discounting system is hurting their business since people misuse it by for example, on a weekend, get 1+1 on drinks at one place and then grab 1+1 on food at another place. This unarguably has hut the owner's pockets

2) Lack of transparency from Zomato on their rating system and the fact that Zomato provide details of customers using which Restaurants can build a loyal customer base.

3) Large chains like Domino's and McD are able to negotiate huge bargain on commissions(7-8%) while small restaurants have to agree to around 20-25% to even be visible on the platform. This doesn't include the hefty advertising fee. Hence, no uniform policy and systematic abuse of MSME eateries.

Now, these may seem like business decisions on part of Zomato to become profitable. Still, they have agreed to tweak Gold program, rather unfairly to us as customers.

AskIndia,Strategy to reduce open defecation in rural communities. How can local government help and incentivize? (And other questions!)," 

Hi [r/india](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/),

I need to find out some information about the powers, structure and management of local government in rural india.

&amp;#x200B;

**Background:** I work at a UK water company and am working on an extra-curricular charity project with WaterAid. Part of this project is to 'develop a strategy to reduce open-defecation in rural communities.' Specifically we are focusing on the district of *Bhadrak*. We are able to make use of volunteers in the area, small amounts of cash provided to each village where twin-pit toilets have been installed (about $100 per village), medical/health care centres/professionals, community groups and schools.

&amp;#x200B;

I won't go into detail of root causes of open defecation, as I'm sure anyone in India would be fully aware, but briefly the root cause is that in rural communities it is the cultural and behavioural norm to defecate in the open. Reasons such as believing toilets to be unhygienic, not wishing to share with in-laws, men not wanting to 'hide their shame', not wanting to do the work of emptying toilet pits are a few. The problems this leads to are multiple health and economic issues as well as huge risk of violence against women.

&amp;#x200B;

So far we have strategies to educate, inform etc etc using the volunteers via all the channels we have available to us (classroom activities, women's group education and discussion, medical practitioners discussing defecation when they meet patients and so on). However our overall goal to tie it all together is to get locals who support hygienic toilet use to petition for a Gram Sabha on the issue. It's my understanding that 10% of  18+ villagers (or 50 villagers, whichever is higher) are needed in order for this to happen . The overall strategy is based on influencing people through each of these opportunities, find champions to support the idea and petition for Gram Sabha. Then, *I don't know what we should be aiming for from there?*

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is what powers does the Gram Sabha/Gram Panchayat have. I understand the basic structure of local government, but *we need to figure out what we actually want to come out of Gram Sabha. What could they do to help fight this issue?*

&amp;#x200B;

**Local Government:**

\- How much funding do they get and how much can they spend on non-centralised (local) projects

\- What powers does the local government have that can help incetivize changing behaviours

\- Are there community votes at Gram Sabha or are decisions made by entirely by government

\- Can decisions be made without Gram Sabha

\- Is a Gram Sabha releated to the issue of open defecation realistic?

\- What does the process of villagers petition for a Gram Sabha look like?

&amp;#x200B;

**Other questions you may like to help me with:**

\- How can you incentivize rural, religious communities to change their behaviour.

\- Are there any major issues I've missed leading to open-defecation in rural communities and how could we counteract them?

\- Do you live or know anyone in a rural community (or do you practice open defecation)? - ***I would love to speak to you***

\- Does anyone know of, or have ideas of, cheap retro-fit ideas for the twin pits (to improve accessibility for elderly/disabled people)

I would be very grateful for any help, insight or advice anyone can offer. I really feel like in order to develop a successful plan I need the perspective of people from India, so please help me! Thank you guys!

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR - Developing a strategy to reduce open defecation in rural Indian communities. How can we use local government? Any other advice or information."

Please can you all guide me how to build a decent coding background in the next month or so. Should I join any coaching classes for computer programming or they are just there for money making. Any books or video lecture suggestions would be helpful. 

I think this post would be helpful for several people who just got out of school and are planning to go to college."

AskIndia,"[np] [askindia] Need a complete guide to starting on your own in the IT industry - freelancing, OPC, LLP.","this comes from the many questions I see here which further give rise to may more in my mind.

I have been reading on many websites and trying to find out the processes, terminology and what not - just to be stuck in reading but not doing anything.

Randian's who have managed to and/or doing it on there own, please put in your experiences and guides to do the needful.

I'd like to stress here that though the process is considered simpler now, it seems far too bureaucratic  for a IT simpleton like me. From what I have read and understood:

* LLP or Private Limited are better than OPC (why?)
* LLP or PL need 3 people, while OPC needs one and one for nomination
* register company, get some secure USB token
* register trade marks (but no idea how to register different company names and products - like One97 and Paytm) for apt classes (35 to 45) or in all of them
* dedicated Office : needed or not?
* GST, VAT, etc :  what's needed and when?

And then there is freelancing and creating your own product - for which what and what not's are not clear anywhere. because presumably you'd need trademark and stuff there too and you also need TAN and PAN and DIN and current accounts and etc.

What I am interested in creating my web based product, and deploying it and making money. problem is I don't know if it is actually that simple.

So I don't want to make it about myself. I'd like this to be for others too who might want to seek up similar help or who'd step on this path in future.

AskIndia,"[AskIndia] Guidance regarding DTU, NSUT &amp; IGDTU","*I have already posted this query on India_Academia but haven't got any reply. *

Hello all, My sister got a 49,000 rank in JEE Mains with Delhi domicile. She has got MAE in IGDTU till Round 1, but hasn't been upgraded till Round 3. Our options below in order of choice filling - 

1) IGDTU - ECE Electronics - I was expecting her to get this till round 3 but haven't till now, so a bit worried

2) NSUT - MPAE Manufacturing Process &amp; Automation Engg - Very difficult to get considering last year cutoffs - may get only after Round 4

3) DTU - MAM Mechanical &amp; Automotive Engg - May not get - high cutoff

4) NSUT - BT Biotechnology - Not a lucrative branch, but I have preferred it over other slightly better or similar branches of DTU because of lesser number of students (= better chance of getting placed)

5) IGDTU - MAE Mechanical &amp; Automation Engg - Allotted

6) DTU - PIE Production &amp; Industrial Engg - All of below branches are almost alike in placement scenario as all of them have very less/poor Core placement options. Students from these branches either go for Software, other Non-core profiles, MBA or MS. 

7) DTU - Civil

8) DTU - EP Engg Physics

9) DTU - Polymer

10) DTU - ENE Environmental Engg

11) DTU - BT Biotechnology

Of late I have been thinking if we should prefer BT, Polymer from DTU (far better college than IG) over MAE (better branch than BT) from IGDTU. I myself am from an IIT but from Civil branch and couldn't get a placement from campus. So I would totally prefer a better branch in place of better college but MAE is not an exceptional branch either. And she won't get IT in IGDTU either. 

Q1. Should I move DTU branches above MAE from IGDTU?

Q2. Considering no. of students, should I keep NSUT BT above DTU branches?

Q3. I have read some post on quora stating that NSUT is better for circuit branches, and DTU is better for rest. How true is that? 

Q4. Is ECE at IGDTU good enough? (if she gets it in further rounds)

Kindly suggest edits to the above order.

AskIndia,[AskIndia] Why do we have so much distrust of Businesses and Markets?,"Was listening to a talk from Kunal Shah (founder of Freecharge and Cred) and found quite a few insights about the attitude of Indians towards generating wealth through businesses.

A few things really stood out. For example -

1. India has a unique MRP system for products found nowhere else in the world. It gives us the illusion that we are charged fairly for our goods but it works very counter-intuitively against the poor.
Because the rich pay almost the same price as the poor. A richer neighbourhood should have richer prices than in a poorer neighbourhood.
The manufacturer has to price the MRP at a rate higher than he would in a competitive market because he needs to make sure he covers his cost or overruns due to dead or destroyed stock.

2. How we, as Indians, value money over time. We would not pay for quality which saves us time but we will gladly buy sub-quality goods if it saves us money.

3. We question and probe profit percentages of each private company but have no clue about the efficiency of government spending and yet we keep clamouring for more taxes.

4. Pre-1991, we were poor and ridden with Socialist policies which championed the poor and the farmers and we went bankrupt. But after 1991, when we allowed foreign money to come in, we saw a substantial rise in the standard of living and goods.
Yet, we are still calling restrictions on foreign capital in e-commerce and retail which is just perplexing.

5. We think the private companies are out to loot the people of India and we think Adani and Ambani are rich because of Modi but it is, in fact, the lack of competition and implementation of endless rules and licenses that allow Adani and Reliance to operate in any field with almost no competition.


I don't get it. Is this an education thing? Have we been taught capitalism incorrectly? The numbers are so clear yet we are still stuck in denial about having government involvement in the economy. So many people flock to capitalist economies from India yet why do we trust the government so much?

And before anyone says, yes I do think Healthcare, defense, law and order should be under government along with economic incentives for education and research but beyond that, you don't really need government."

AskIndia,[Question] What do you think about teachers? And schools in general.,"Don't know if you can relate to this. I just wanna try ...

When you're in class, does the teacher ever do this thing where they explain you something simple and mundane with a lot of passion and care, but rush through the genuinely hard concepts?

This is just something I never talked about. I'm in college and working so I don't interact with teachers at all. But I remember a few years ago in class 10/11, the Physics teacher spent like 30 minutes explaining how electromagnetic induction works, but then while solving some equation he all of sudden introduced the concept of definite integrals. I immediately asked him what that was, to which he did some funky hand waiving, implying it was not something worth worring about.

There are many more examples that I can say, but my point is that, teachers waste a lot of time telling us things that are obvious, things which don't need too much explanation because it's already found in our textbooks. But anything that's not in the book, like some new word or idea (I can usually tell what topic the teacher will be unwilling to expand on), or something that seems to invite private engagement (ahem, private tuition), they will ignore, as if even talking about that is a moral sin.

There's another thing I always wanted to ask you. When you were in school, did you have music periods and ""games"" period, which were essentially free periods? In my life, in 12 years they taught the students nothing about music. But on the fees book, the payment was divided into columns made for music and games and craft etc. We never got to do any of those things. But that's just my story. It probably is not the case in most schools.

So how do feel about our education and the people assigned to guide the youth of India?"

AskIndia,Why doesn't the locked Mukesh Ambani page on Wikipedia have a controversy section? [AskIndia],"This is the Wikipedia page for [Mukesh Ambani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mukesh_Ambani). It is locked, fairly simpering in nature, and lacks any controversy section.

The equivalent entry on [Dhirubhai Ambani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhirubhai_Ambani) is not locked but is also fairly blank in its description. 

Wikipedia is supposed to a neutral entry for human knowledge curated by the community. In instances where an article is repeatedly vandalized or at constant risk of vandalization, it can be expected to be ""locked"" from edits that are not approved by a higher power.

I'm not the first to mention this. One Quora user (in a post titled ""How corrupt is Mukesh Ambani?
"") described his attempt to edit the page and how it was stumped by higher-level editors.

In the case of India's richest and most powerful person, it is understandable that certain information is undesirable in the public realm. However, that does not mean we should bow our heads.

Finding out anything about the Ambani's is notoriously difficult. Sure, you could follow newspaper headlines over the least few years but they have a tendency of being fickle. Remember when Ambani's kid mowed someone over in an Aston Martin? Or when the family was involved in a [bitter feud](https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/cover-story/story/19890831-bombay-dyeing-reliance-feud-ril-executive-arrested-on-charge-of-conspiring-to-kill-nusli-wadia-816444-1989-08-31) with Nusli Wadia (that culminated in a murder charge)?

The saga of Ambani is too vast to remember everything. Only a person who reads the paper every day for the last 75 years will know their true history and even then he knows just a fraction. I admit, I don't know enough. But I do know that there is a concerted attempt to control information about Reliance.

We see it in [Reliance ownership of the media](https://caravanmagazine.in/vantage/the-big-five-the-media-companies-that-the-modi-government-must-scrutinise-to-fulfill-its-promise-of-ending-crony-capitalism), in their purchase and regulation of our satire ([they even bought out FakingNews.com](https://www.medianama.com/2013/05/223-firstpost-fakingnews/) in its early days - understanding early that such sites could be far more critical than investigatory journalists and far more apt as well). We see it in [near billion dollar](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/rafale-row-anil-ambani-files-rs-5000-crore-defamation-suit-against-national-herald-congress-leader/articleshow/65546040.cms) defamation cases. We see it when books that try to tell this story [are banned from being published in India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Polyester_Prince).

You know what is happening. I know what is happening. We all know it. Anyone on the street will tell you this and that about how Ambani pulls every string. And I will be the first to be realistic. 

**However, an open ledger of information does not have the same weakness as a media organisation that has to pay salaries.** 

Use a proxy and edit. Cite your sources well. What are you doing wrong when it is done in the name of the truth? But before this can even happen, don't we need to get past that lock?

To get an edit made through a semi-protected article, you need to propose an edit on its talk page. 

Honestly, if I knew enough and wasn't afraid myself, I'd make the edits. But I think there might be smarter and better people on here who could give me added perspective. I don't have experience editing Wikipedia and I believe in this happening to a fair standard.

Just putting this out there. My apologies if my own action seem toothless. "

AskIndia,In search for the family of the Indian migrants who are my ancestors,"I’m not sure if many people in India know about this part of history, but I’ll try to explain what I know as best as I can.

Back at the end of the 19th century, The Netherlands owned Dutch Guyana (now called Suriname), a small piece of land above Brazil that they traded with the English for the piece of land which they eventually created New York on (used to be New Amsterdam). They owned various plantations where slaves used to work. After they decided to abolish slavery, they needed new folks to work the land. 

From what I know, the Dutch struck a deal with the English to get Indian people to work in their colony. These people were told that they would come back rich after a few years of work so they could live like maharajas. A lot of people decided to take the chance, either because they were in a low caste or might have done something against the law in India. They were coming from either Calcutta (my mother’s ancestors) or Bihar (my father’s ancestors).

Does anybody know why they might have chosen to seek their faith in another country? What I know is that many Indians in Suriname decided to add “Singh” to their surname just because that sounds fancier or something. My grandfather tells that his father who came from India barely spoke about his life back there. Does anyone know more about this period and the people that left India? I’m very curious what my ancestors’ lives must have been back then. 

TLDR; great grand parents are from India. Moved to Surinam for work. Now living in the Netherlands. Would like to know more about India from before the move to Surinam."

AskIndia,Interesting perspective of Sacred Games from the commercial cinema lovers angle... but are they really right?,"I was surprised (and curious) about the numbers behind Kabir Singh's commercial success and stumbled upon this page while googling stuff. Have a look at the question asked [here](https://boxofficeindia.com/report-details.php?articleid=5202) and the answer of BoxOfficeIndia editors on Sacred Games' popularity (or lack of it). Just highlighting some of the things they say:  

&amp;#x200B;

*Q: Sacred Games is having a second part despite it being very bad and practically unwatchable...*

*A: India does not patronize this sort of stuff and* ***Netflix audience in India*** ***watches foreign programs not the sub standard Indian stuff***.....Netflix knows what is going to grow subscriber base and its not Sacred Games for sure. Its ***actual very good this sort of rubbish like Sacred Games goes to digital*** *otherwise we would have to bear toned down versions in cinemas. ......This is just a second part there could be another one but eventually when its not working it will die.....Sacred Games is like the Sahib Biwi Aur Gangster of digital as that film had three parts despite no one really watching any of the films. Of course it* ***may be talked well off but what comes out of the mouth and actually having watchers is two different things.***  

&amp;#x200B;

Now I have heard that the website is a key source to assess commercial performances of movies and I also understand that maybe Sacred Games doesn't qualify as commercial success but I am genuinely curious who are these people, and have they literally been living in caves not to acknowledge the fact that this is the content a lot of us liked and want.... Or am I wrong?"

I have a HP Omen 15 (2019 Model) with a RTX 2060. I want to use a 43"" 4k tv as an everyday monitor now. I read a lot about the Chroma 4:4:4:4 ratings and how they are very important for the texts to be clear. Now, does anybody use a 4k tv with the Chroma 4:4:4:4 ratings? Can you please tell me about the model and brand of the tv and hopefully a picture of how clear the texts are on the websites?

Also, Can my graphic card support the 43"" 4K TV? 

P.S: I am looking at this as a replacement for the bulky 4 FHD monitor setup i currently have. I would primarily be using this monitor for a web dashboard related work and not for gaming. All i need is a lot of screen real estate. At least enough to have 4 chrome pages adjacent to each other.

Is there a manner for me to copy my content while the display is not working?

Additionally, I am looking to buy a new phone and on account of my great experience with OnePlus so far, I am inclined towards OnePlus 6t which is for 27999 INR or OP7 (non Pro) which is for 32999 INR.. Which would you recommend, as I understand that 6T has dual cameras but 7 only depth sensor and a camera... I don't want to spend money on the OP7Pro which is 52999 INR

AskIndia,"Question for Indians: would you say that the Indian work ethic is similar to the Japanese, where ""appearing to work"" is more important than productivity level?","In Japanese salaryman culture, it's common for workers to spend work hours being unproductive, or even having nothing to do until their boss gives them work. The culture surrounding work emphasizes *being at work* and *appearing to work*, but actual level of productivity is less important. It's more important that your butt is in the chair for 10 hours a day than that you're productive. This is why despite the long hours, [Japan has a very low level of productivity](https://www.tokyoreview.net/2018/07/japan-productivity-overwork/):

&gt;The problem is that for Japan, productivity isn’t the point. The professional culture is input-based (full schedules of meetings, onerous paperwork and menial tasks, and similar) rather than output-based, where long hours and late nights are a less a means to accomplish tasks and more of a means of value-signaling, demonstrating devotion to the organization and commitment to the team members. That isn’t unique to Japan – any visitor to Washington, DC will notice people boasting of their lifespan-shortening work regimens – but what’s unique to Japan is prioritizing the effort made over concrete results. There are two reasons why the problem is so pernicious.

I was wondering if this work culture would also apply to India. I know very little about Indian work culture. Does it similarly emphasize appearance and the ""ritual"" of work, over raw productivity?"
AskIndia,Can I adopt a kid without marrying?,"I feel like there are too many kids and the population is too high. Instead, I want to adopt one and provide him or her a good future. the important question now is can I adopt a kid without marrying?"
AskIndia,I need advice on how to go forward with this.,"In the 26 years of my life I've heard my father scream emptily threatening: ""I will commit suicide"" or ""I will give you a divorce"" so much at my mum, that today when he finally screamed the same old things at her, I said ""lets go to the police and court"" to which he said: ""no! why will we go to the court? lets just live separately instead"".
When I continued stressing about going to the court, he angrily stormed off the house with another of his old threats saying ""I will leave this house"". I followed him, just like I've been doing the last couple of times and he went and sat angrily in a park for the next 3 hours while I waited patiently outside, I did not speak a word with him thru this whole ordeal. after which he came back home and rejected having lunch my mum prepared and went off to the office.
that was 10 'o'clock in the morning. I had to skip office today because I was mentally paralysed and had to curl up in bed sleep the entire day.

My father, initially when I was a kid, was both physically and mentally abusive to us, though with time he quit abusing physically but his mental torture became worse. he forced my mum to shut the business she was running and economically strangled her when I was in 4th grade. He cut her ties off both with her family and friends circles and isolated her, He has said and continues to this day say horrendous things to and about her which are completely false and cause irreversible psychological damage to her (extremely low-self esteem, self pity and loathing) 

my childhood memories with him include (to quote a few):
Him taking us all to a lake in our city to jump into and commit suicide one late evening  
Him hitting me with a belt one day after coming home from office.
Him throwing plates with food around the house that my mum cooked and served him.
My mum either being extremely anxious or crying because of him.
His earth-shatteringly loud shouting.
Also recently in the last one year, after researching his behavioural patterns, I figured out that he has Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) the extreme of its kind.
that did help us a bit to understand him and tolerate him better thanks to all the articles and youtube videos available online. me and my mum sat down and discussed strategies and solutions to bear with his behavior without in anyway aggravating it. 
but at least once every month (at least!) he triggers my mum to a point where she just can't keep quiet anymore and then uses that opportunity to belittle her further and further and make her feel like a piece of trash.

I come from an Indian family and live in an extremely conservative society. My mum has, ever since her marriage, been conditioned to fear the society's judgement and insults that will come with divorce. Initially when I was just a baby and she wanted to quit her marriage, she approached her own father who asked her to shut her mouth and learn to deal with it.
she is absolutely terrified of divorce and cannot imagine a life like that and would much rather prefer living in this hell day-in and day-out because a known devil is better than an unknown devil.

I am a 'man' who has just entered his late 20's, but I don't feel man enough, I feel like a child and I find myself behaving like one too. All of my childhood has been extremely depressening with a lot of issues, I was sexually abused as a kid by a family member, bullied in school and failed most of my subjects. And whenever I'm around my father I'm mentally crippled by anxiety. I have stopped speaking with him for the past two years now even though we live in the same house, which he blames my mum every other day for apparently brainwashing us against him.

He gives my mum money that's less than enough to run the house comfortably, even though he earns pretty well, and then she has to beg him for more money, at which point he starts abusing her even more and throws the money at her condescendingly. 
Even though I am slowly becoming financially independent, there is still quite some time before I become absolutely independent, but that doesn't seem to help my case because I cant move out if my mum won't. and even if I did, I'd have to constantly live in the fear of him physically or mentally abusing her with more freedom than ever, with no one around to protect her."

AskIndia,Can someone please help me with a few questions about CIBIL,"Hey guys, I didn't know where else to post this; so I'm sorry if it doesn't belong here. I recently applied, and got approved for a Credit Card, and I just have a few questions regarding the impact of the CC on my CIBIL score. I am planning on applying for a student loan in a year for studying abroad, which is why my CIBIL score is important to me.

I didn't really get a CC for the purpose of having a credit facility. I just got it for the payback points and other perks (like the complementary airport lounge visit). My bank couldn't give me a high credit limit as I am working in an entry level position earning 20k pm. They just gave me a credit limit of 20k. My expenses for a month usually reach around 10k to 15k, which I would like to make using my CC for the payback points. However, as I understand it, having a high credit utilization ratio can have a negative impact on my credit score. This brings me to my first question; if I keep paying off my CC after each transaction, will it reduce my credit utilization ratio. So for example, if I want to spend 15k in a month, I would spend 5k, then pay off the amount due on my CC, spend another 5k, pay it off, and then spend another 5k and pay it off. Does this mean that my credit utilization ratio would be 25%(5k/20k) or would it be 75%(15k/20k) for the said month? Another similar question is, if I spend 45k in a single month like I mentioned above (spend 15k, payoff 15k.....) what would be my credit utilization ratio? Like I said before, I don't really care about availing credit facility and I'm going to be using my CC just like a Debit Card (i.e. paying it off as soon as I spend anything on it).

I hope I explained my question properly, but if not, I would be happy to explain it more in the comments."

AskIndia,Is there anything in India that'll give you a quality of life at least somewhat near to those doing an MS in US and working there?,"Here me out. 

I know the pay is way better and nothing can match it in India. The working culture and the hours will probably be better too. Even the living conditions and fun and travel and what not.

I am not talking about outright better than US. But is there any hope of ""making it"" by staying right here, in India? Being at the top of you game making may be around 30-40% of what they make there? Build some financial cushion and attain some luxury, somewhere near to the guys over there?

Is there no privilege of being an Indian, that I could use to my advantage? Some legal edge for business? Some provision of law allowing better access to financial instruments and investments?

Any argument I can come up with, ends with, if you as much effort over there you will be better off 10x. And I am really unable to wrap my head around this.

I am not seeking validation or assurances, I really want to know what you think guys. Did you ever have this dilemma? How'd you come to terms with it or what have you done about it?

I'd even love to hear even from the folks who have gone the MS in US route. Maybe you know someone who didn't choose the same and is better off/worse off. Anything.

AskIndia,Went to an Indian Hindu temple in my quest for spiritual learning. Had a very bad experience with 2 people there. Is this part of Indian culture?,"As a white man, I respect that naturally I will attract attention when in a facility that's predominantly visited by Indians.

I was approached by two people at different times, with the exact same nosy attitude and fired off a series of interrogative questions within the first 3 minutes. I asked them if they can point me towards any spiritual teachings, but instead of answering my question, they shot off one question after the after. 

\- Where are you from?

\- Where do you live?

\- What work do you do?

\- What is your salary?

\- Are you married? Why not?

\- What do your parents do?

I didn't want to be rude, given I am a guest in a facility and I had no idea who these guys were. The second one started ordering me around, like ""sit there"", ""put your hands like this"", ""don't look there, look here"" etc. I gained no spiritual insight - just an encounter with a control freak and some very bad mannered people. 

Is this what Indian society is like? I'm quite a private person, and not used to sharing my demographic profile with total randoms - how do others tell them to mind their own business? It ruined my experience."

AskIndia,"I absolutely hate my current job,wanna get out of it but also worried about the fact that what if i don't get another job or stay unemployed for a long time","i work in an IT MNC(joined last yr in august)..i am in a project that requires me to work in a shift from 12pm to 9pm and being new to the project idk much about it how things work and how to go about stuff..when i ask my Team members they don't explain things clearly and expect me to get the tasks done in a given timeframe and also my manager is a pain(expects too much)even the tech stack is outdated and has no future scope...i absolutely hate this but at the same time i fear that if i leave then it would be very difficult for me to search for another company as i have not much work ex(i graduated last year in june) 
reasons i currenlty hate my job(this project in specific):-

1.Team members do not explain things clearly they are all experienced i am new to this so it would take time for me to absorb all the things but they expect me to get it completed asap this causes me anxiety pressure and nervouseness

2. 12pm-9pm this shift+the location of my office is very shady no public transport after 8pm although company provides cab service but i would reach my home faster taking the public transport

3.My manager,he is annoying AF expects too much and never appreciates even if i try and always asks me to send daily status mail(idk what to send if one day theres no progress) 

4.The tech stack is outdated even though there is some Java but no real coding stuff its mainly testing or something like that

P.S. There is bond of 2 years as well,and if i don't pay the bond amount they won't give me a relieving letter(worried about this as it shouldn't be like i was unemployed for an year if i go for an interview somewhere else)
 My 1 year got wasted i just have the amount of experience but tbh i learnt nothing in terms of technical knowledge that makes me really sad and worry as to what my future holds"
AskIndia,Ever heard of a movie called omertà? A cult Rajkumar Rao movie that vanished after release.,"Omerta, a movie released in 2018, a true story based on the life of the terrorist Omar Saeed Shaikh, has completely vanished after its release. By vanish I mean no DVDs, no Torrents, no online streaming - legal, paid, illegal. Simply Nothing. 

It's interesting how we've all missed it. A movie where the perspective seems to give an insight from the perspective of the perpetrator is simply not be heard of. It's like it was never even made. I find people commenting about how good of an actor, actors nowadays in India, thanks to our acclaim of Nawaz, irfan, Ayushmann, Vicky and even Rajkummar. But it just seems hard to digest how we all jump over movies like this.

AskIndia,Indian Judiciary - Boon or Curse,"Recently I paid 22k to a company for a service. I connected to them through social media and the compnay is from a different state than me. They did not provide good service and even failed to fulfill their certain condition which in turn made it eligable to claim refund. Now, I went to consumer court, tried cyber crime department, police department and all the possible ways to get my refund but there is no result. 
When I approached one of the well known advocate of my city he advised me not go the judiciary way. 
In India, (Civil) decisions are so prolonged that it is really of no use. As it is said that justice delayed is justice denied. There are numerous cases where someone has illegally occupied somebody else's property and the case is going on for years. 
So imagine the cost of property is 1 million and to get the occupancy you need to invest 25 thousand is a good deal. Now you can invest 50 thousand every year to prolong the case. It is quite cheaper than actually renting the property. Secondly the owner has to also bear the same cost just to fight back or else in most of the cases people prefer not to fight and give away such property."

I fear that other than the fort, there won´t be much to do in Gwalior. Also I´m not sure whether it´s actually good to go to Gwalior just because there will be less tourists - maybe that is a disadvantage ( re. accomodation, transport, places to eat, and general acceptance of tourists).

AskIndia,Jio Giga Fiber - Speed issues,"Hey guys !

So I have been using the Jio Giga Fiber for more than a year. 

My basic use is streaming (Netflix, Prime, Hotstar etc.) and downloading via torrents and some debrid sites (alldebrid/real debrid/premiumize.me etc). 

Till about 2-3 weeks back, I was getting consistent speeds of 90 mbps+ on almost all sites, with no throttling whatsoever. 

About 2 weeks back, I noticed that speeds on torrents and debrid sites has fallen to 15-20 mbps. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Changed DNS (cycled between Google, Cloudfare and Jio) to no use

\- Bought subs to different debrid sites, and the speeds are consistent (about 3 MBps) on all sites (and torrents)

\- Speedtest to Indian servers on [Speedtest.net](https://Speedtest.net) shows 100 mbps connection, same with Netflix (local CDNs I guess)

\- Speedtest to foreign servers (Singapore, HK etc) shows speeds of 10-20 mbps, with high pings

&amp;#x200B;

I also have an Airtel broadband connection - 40 mbps. I tried the same links with Airtel, and they max out the connection within seconds, so most likely the issue is with Jio. 

&amp;#x200B;

Did a tracert to some of the debrid sites for both Jio and Airtel. Airtel showed 6 hops, Jio 12 hops. 

&amp;#x200B;

I called Jio's CC and they basically said as long as ANY server shows 100 mbps speeds, they cannot do anything and they do not have a way to escalate it further. 

&amp;#x200B;

Checked with a friend who stays about 4-5 kms away, in a different society and uses Jio. He is facing the same issue. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any recommendation on how to proceed further ?  Any members here facing the same issue ?"

AskIndia,Change my view India: Civil Service is not a good career option as far as freedom and power are concerned.,"Civil Service is not a good career option as far as freedom and power to make changes are concerned. In this post, by civil servants I mostly mean the glamorous posts like collectors and IPS officers. But it is applicable to other posts too.

Some people say civil servants like collectors and IPS officers can make a great deal of changes. But they're ability to make changes is limited to only very few areas. If a person like a collector or an IPS is to move against a minister or a politician or a wealthy businessman, then it is most probably sure that he/she will have a tough time. Probably he/she will be suspended or transferred.

As India is a democracy the elected representatives have more power over the executionaries of which civil servants are a part. Besides politicians have the support of the masses in many cases and they bend the laws using their power.

Waste management, traffic etc are some of the areas in which civil servants can make changes. These are areas in which ministers and politicians do not interfere much.

Many collectors and IPS officers are puppets under politicians. Even if a politician gets behind the bars, he/she would be getting preferential treatment in there.

Civil service is glamorous only because of the salary and benefits and respect one gets from being in that position. I don't understand why people are going after it still if they want to have real freedom and power. Just getting money won't give us enough freedom. Of course. There are those civil servants who are highly corrupted. But then even they are just puppets under the politicians.

Please do try to change my view."

AskIndia,Class Action Lawsuits / Distressed Real Estate Investors," 

Is there any forum / platform for stressed out RE Investors (or any other group of distressed customers) where they can get together and possibly plan out a Class Action Lawsuit? ( [https://www.obhanandassociates.com/blog/class-action-suits-in-india/?utm\_source=Mondaq&amp;utm\_medium=syndication&amp;utm\_campaign=View-Original](https://www.obhanandassociates.com/blog/class-action-suits-in-india/?utm_source=Mondaq&amp;utm_medium=syndication&amp;utm_campaign=View-Original) )

Most, if not all, RE Developers have been notorious for raising money for project X and then putting that money in use for project Y, while delaying and eventually stopping the 'Reassured Return' payments that they had originally promised. Moreover, developers have indirectly forced RE Investors, who often do not have any other rational choice, to accept changes in the original agreements of the investment. These changes always mean a loss to the investor and a convenient gain for the developer.

Because of high litigation costs and all the other headaches associated with litigation, one particular investor often does not possess the time and patience to fight against these asshole companies. More often than not the developers get away with their bullshit. The ones who have the courage to protest are only met with employees at the lowest level.

I can't seem to find a platform where investors in a particular project can get together and discuss further plans of action. There's GOT to be one! And if there is'nt one then how can one approach to connect with other investors in the same project?

Please feel free to reach out /comment if you can relate to this post / know of someone who might.

Looking forward to pick some brains in this community.

TL;DR: RE developers are major arseholes. Looking for a platform / forum where RE investors of a particular project can connect with each other and plan out Class Action Lawsuits. And if there isn't one, then looking for suggestions to overcome this problem."

I know these questions sound stupid, but I know nothing about it, and am interested in it for a film, so would really appreciate it if anyone has any information or experience or knows anything about it at all!

AskIndia,"I need help . If u guys have time , please help .","Didn't get good colleges either in jee mains or advanced . Gave wbjee and got a rank of 9.7k . I was suffering from typhoid at the time of jee mains paper 2 . So couldn't prepare myself and hence those bad results . Although I got into BHU pursuing chemistry honors . But soon I realized I was not interested in it . 

Now here I am , sitting at home thinking what to do. I can get into Heritage Institute of Technology , Kolkata and get streams like mechanical , civil , applied electronics and instrumentation and electrical . My father is going to jalpaiguri tomorrow because Jalpaiguri government engineering college has hosted decentralised counselling for vacant seats . Jadavpur university too has hosted decentralised counselling and has called students upto 10k in wbjee . Since I have a rank of 9.7k , chances are negligible to get any stream there . 

My question is should I take a drop ? Or get admission in Heritage Institute of Technology , Kolkata ?

AskIndia,So is it PTSD ?,"So here's a thing , every time I experience agression like someone shouts at me / near me , someone gets aggressive and physical etc I feel really sick inside stomach , my heart beat rises real fast , I get super nervous and anxious , my ears feel warm and blank , forehead and hair feels hot and sweaty , breathing feels difficult , in extreme cases I feel blacked-out . I kinda feel this is PTSD developed due to my altercation with my dad couple of years ago and all my episodes mostly with him leading upto the said altercation , I'm not sure that the said event itself is  a trigger point , but it is one of the things that tend to come to my mind post my episodes of  heightened state of fear / anger  . 
I tried talking to a therapist couple of times before but our interactions were never able to reach any fruitful state . Simply speaking , I believe I have too much to unpack , but when I finally get to talk to them it kinda feels like a lot of the troubling stuff seems irrelevant ,
 Sometimes somewhat borderline inappropriate  to our conversation . 

When someone asks me what's essentially wrong with me , I don't have a definate answer so it makes it incredibly difficult to ask family members for help , they just try their age old method of talking sense into me by asking me stop overthinking as if I have control , it makes it really difficult for me to socialize , fear of a breakdown . 

What do you think I should / can do ? Should i give my parents an ultimatum that they take me to a psychiatrist directly as  I was once referred to one by a psychologist but we just decided to not peruse it . I think they think I'm playing this therapy card every time I want to escape responsibility but they never expressed it outrightly  

I'm kinda free right now , waiting for my degree results , I'm 2 years behind my herd .Also no one in my life seems to be brave enough to confront me about my future , I'm scared of making a decision due to my present degree state , I wander too much so it kinda feels like I can do everything but when I attempt to figure out what to do , reallity hits me hard , so I'm super scared thus in constant denial"
AskIndia,How bad would gifting a smartphone to a teenager be?,"Hey guys!

I am in a bit of a dilemma and could really use some help from here. My 16 year old cousin passed his 10th class ICSE board exams with flying colors and I asked him what would he like as a gift for his brilliant performance. He asked me for a smartphone (RealMe 3 Pro to be precise. Damn kid XD) . Now I'm in a fix!

I think getting his own personal smartphone at this age is not going to be a good idea. He is a good kid, sincere, motivated and hardworking, and seeing him deteriorate in his 11th and 12th would be really painful. I have seen him around smartphones and trust me, he's a leech! Despite not having his own smartphone, he would be glued to my aunt's or my uncle's (his parents) phones during his 8th and 9th standard. So much that he would remain standing beside the socket while the phone gets charged and he plays his games. There was strictness from his parents during 10th standard and it worked since till 10th, kids are still kids, but I don't think the same can be enforced now. Besides, my aunt-uncle are simple, laid-back pahadi folks who would probably give up after 2-3 explanations/arguments from his side. They wouldn't bug him much. They are not the super educated, urban parents with whom their kids share everything and the parents discuss safe sex/menstruation with them. (Out of context examples??)

I think if his parents remain strict and restrict his usage and specially avoid giving it to him at nights, it would be still okay but such restrictions are hard to do any good to the parent-kid relationship(which is not much in this case) and also, kids are smart at sneaking ;) I used to take my dad's Nokia brick (not even a smartphone LoL) all the time after he fell asleep to chat with my friends when I was in 11th. I am not saying all kids are the same but I hope you get my point.

I understand it all boils down to how sincere the kid is and I am also sure there are many who don't get that distracted and use their phones responsibly. Its just that I don't wanna see my little brother waste his time. Phones are SUPER distracting.

So, what do I do? Any parents here who could monitor their kid's usage and can vouch that phone aren't that bad IF proper supervision is there? Any big brothers/sisters' experiences who gifted their young siblings phones and regretted it? People who got phones after 10th and can give some insight who badly/responsibly they used it? (I didn't get one after 10th. I bought one after entering college after collecting reward money for some months from various relatives for good 12th marks LoL)

PS : Fun conversation from sometime in this January that I remembered. My husband asked him, ""So you also play PUBG like other kids these days?"" ""Na, I don't"" Husband, "" Thats good! Aajkal to sab deewaane hai. (Everyone's crazy these days for it"" ""Yeah, but mummy ke phone me chalta nahi, kaise khelu? (Doesn't work in mom's phone. What do I do?"". Husband amused."

AskIndia,How do you deal with Indian society being over 30 and unmarried?,"This post will be kind of a rant. I am 31, male, currently working in US. I recently got out of a relationship that was going nowhere and have been feeling great and free after the breakup. However, some people around me like to remind me that I am a loser for not being 'settled' yet. And this is not some direct insult as well. It comes in form of subtle concerns such as ""Oh, people will start thinking there is something wrong with you"" and shit. Geez, relax you fucking 'relatives'. I am 31, not 80. Even 80 year olds are dating and finding partners. I want to take time and focus on myself and my hobbies. Who cares what age I settle in or even not settle for that matter. I may find someone I want to marry at 35,40,45 or not at all. Does it diminish any joy in life? Hell no! Yeah, sometimes it feels like it would be nice to have a partner, but it's foolish to think about what you don't have rather than what can be enjoyed right now. Even though I logically understand that I will be just fine and hopefully find a partner in future, this judgement by relatives (and sometimes even friends) undermines my confidence and makes me think that I should get 'settled' first before enjoying life.

For my fellow randians who also have to deal with this shit (especially back in India where it would be much tougher because you are under constant watch), how do you keep your mind off negative projections by relatives/friends?"

AskIndia,Would your next car be an electric car? If so how much money are you willing to spend and what are your overall thoughts about the EV industry ?,"Hyundai is all set to release their electric car in India on July 9th which is estimated to be around 25 lacs. Now we all know this is too costly for a middle-class person but there's some good news! 
With major companies such as Suzuki announcing that they would stop production of diesel-powered cars starting next year. Moreover, the percentage of people buying both petrol and diesel cars have reduced dramatically. So basically companies such as Hyundai, fiat, Mahindra, Renault, Suzuki have a huge stockpile of cars unsold. Now with rising fuel prices and adding the maintenance costs, people are choosing not to buy a car and are instead using services such us Uber, ola. The government are also offering incentives and are reducing the tax on electric vehicles. (People can refer to the recent budget and see the tax benefit, interest rates on loan for EV vehicles )

Here are a couple of things I would like to see the government implement for the growth of EV cars.

1-charging stations across the country equipped with fast charging so that people traveling to far away places face no worry. 
2-battery production to be done in India on a major scale so the price of the car comes down.

Lastly, I hope all the major car manufacturers understand that electric cars are the future and start manufacturing some decent electric cars with good range, looks and keep a competitive price. 

So do you think you would buy an electric car in the next few years and what are your basic requirements

AskIndia,Suggestions needed for a good mental health improving center.," 

Hi all,

I need some advices/ suggestions.

My mom is having an issue with her mental health - following some traumatic experience from her childhood. Not violent but she is not able to forget them and she is reliving those moments on a daily basis. Imagine going through hellish events every day for last 45+ years!.

It messes her life so badly. she recognizes it sometimes and will ask us to take her to any psychiatrist and psychologists, but she will change her mind soon after that. We tried different medications and counsellings but nothing worked for long. Until recently we all managed to live our life without much trouble, but from last two years things are getting verse, doing strange things which i cannot explain here and started talking to almost everyone some imaginative stories but soon forgets about that. For someone outside she is perfectly normal and they are getting confused.

We are looking for some mental health improving centers,  or someplaces where she can stay for a bit - maybe a month or two - and get help, but not the normal mental hospitals please. We don't want her to be in a place with any violent patients. Even if it pains us all to take this decision, doctors advised us to take this step, so we want her to have the best care available. Preferably in Kerala.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone here care to show some insights or have any advices?"

AskIndia,"Indo-Pak relations, diplomacy and the people - some food for thought","Incoming Rant!

Our opinion regarding our neighbors differ widely depending on what kind of political ideology we hold, and its probably the same on that side of the border too.

I'm going to take a neutral view on this, the world isn't exactly black and white. The extreme hindu nationalist view that every Paki is like a Burhan Wani or Hafiz Saeed is obviously very wrong. But equally wrong is the view of every pseudo leftist that they are like innocent kids holding lollipops! They aren't as bad as portrayed in movies like Gadar and Border, but they aren't as good as portrayed in Razee or Haider also. The truth is always somewhere in the middle or center.

Common sense tells me that most of them are just individuals like us who want to be happy in life. We aren't exactly good friends but we interact a lot culturally, our artists travel there and they come here. Looking at this positively, we are pretty much moving towards a European Union like situation, though we aren't exactly there yet. We get along well generally speaking, except when it comes to KASHMIR!

Now coming to that, let's take a simple house analogy. There are two families living in a single large house separated by a border going through, one family is called IN and another called PK. Each family gets along well with the other, some members move to the other side every now and then and chat with them through internet too.

Now imagine there is this schizophrenic child called KASHMIR who is throwing a lot of tantrums! This kid isn't able to decide whether it wants to move towards one family or the other (or may be it doesn't even want to live in that house but wants ""azadi"" from it!). Both of the families are emotionally attached to this kid and want it to come to their side. While the families usually get along well, they resort to verbal abuses and even fights when the question comes of taking custody of this kid!

I say why both families are spending 90% of their energies on this useless kid when they have more serious problems to deal with? Let them keep the existing relations they have with that kid (namely PoK and IoK from each family's perspective) and simply move on? Forget taking complete custody of that kid and move on with your lives. Let the kid throw all kinds of tantrums, don't listen to it. Both families' peace and prosperity is far more important than this one single kid. So, I say forget all about this kid and simply move on in life? What ya say?"

AskIndia,"Is ""VPK"" an Indian name? Or some kind of abbreviation?","I am a legal assistant in the United States. I encounter names from all over the world, and sometimes there are interesting name conventions that are uncommon or obscure in the US.

Recently, I encountered what looks like a three-part name, the last 'name' being ""VPK"". (We see most names in all caps.)

It is unclear to us if this ""VPK"" is an actual name, or instead some kind of post-nominal abbreviation. (In the manner of ""Jr."", for example.)

""VPK"" already seems unlikely as **any** name, since it has no vowels (How would it be pronounced), but is also much shorter than most other Indian names I have ever encountered. I have a hard time believing this is someone's name.

It seems more likely to me that it's some kind of abbreviation, but after spending a lot of time trying to find out, I'm at a loss. It might even be a special Indian or South Asian legal expression, perhaps indicating marital or other status.

AskIndia,Placement Season: Off Campus Placement,"Hey guys, as the placement season has started and many companies have already started hiring freshers through on campus placement drive, I would like to get information about companies that are hiring off campus as well. 
My college has a rule that once you get an offer from a company, you can only apply for some other company if it offering 2 times more than your current offers. (If you get an offer of 5LPA from Company A, you can only apply to company B if it offering more than 10LPA).
Due to this rule, I am not able to apply to a lot of companies. 
So how to get to know about the off campus drive of various companies, is there any particular resource where such things are updated? Or has anyone gone through off campus placement? 

Thank you 

PS I am looking for the role of Software Engineer."

It was manipulative, toxic, I wanted to breakup, she said if I can't handle her I should leave so I told I want to breakup, again she went crazy, she said she will kill herself and put the blame on me because I am breaking up without any reason and trying not solve the problems, again I started begging her and told her we will meet and solve the issues. We met, I told her about the problems, she also told how she felt, we decided we will solve the problems and try to get into a relationship if everything goes okay, it went well for 2 weeks, I spent the entire weekend with her, I thought she was enjoying it, last week she said she misses sexting and went to see the messages from her ex, I got angry I said if you are serious about this relationship as you say you would have told me that you missed that or atleast read our messages but you went to him, she again went crazy because I said ""you went to him"", she wanted to breakup because I was a bad boyfriend, I was not okay with PDA, I can never be crazy about someone, she got pissed when I said okay when she said we should breakup, again suicidal threats, I completely brokedown and cried and wanted to die, she calmed down. I talked to couple of psychiatrist they said she might be suffering from Borderline personality disorder and its not my responsibility to be her guardian, I met her 2 days back, begged her to come to Psychiatrist and I will pay for everything, she said no she only wanted a boyfriend, I said no and we brokeup. Today she says I am the one who is to blame because I used her and did not love her and she will punish herself for loving me, I said I will take steps to save two lives, she said she will kill herself if I went to cops or talked to her friends or parents about her psychiatric conditions, I was scared so I asked her to promise she won't take any stupid decisions so I won't got to police. No she said stay away from me and blocked me. What should I do please help me with next steps? What if she actually kills herself?

Hi,

Looking to purchase a laptop for programming, watching movies and browse the web. The following configuration seem good, just needed reviews for the same.

 The Asus one seems to have a bad panel but people who own the laptop how bad is it?

The Hp one has a 3 cell battery, IPS LED backlit panel on paper this should translate as better battery life and better display but does it? 

I  can't find information regarding if the HP laptop allows storage to be updated or the SSD is soldered to the laptop. 

The Acer laptop seems good on paper any comments on how good or bad it is ?

&amp;#x200B;

I plan to dual boot have Ubuntu and Windows 10. Any driver issues for Ubuntu I need to be aware off ?

The old laptop I had had a Broadcom Wifi &amp; Bluetooth modules had issues with Ubuntu and needed a bit of effort to get them working.

How is the battery back up of all 3 laptops on Ubuntu ?

Please don't suggest me to get a Mac as the Mac's I am looking for are far far away from my budget.  :("

AskIndia,Struggles with marrying an American girlfriend,"I'm a Tambrahm living in the US. Grew up in the south in a super conservative family. Told my parents I want to marry my American girlfriend of 3 years, and the backlash for the past few months has been extremely severe. In some ways, I understand what they are feeling - they are afraid I will not visit them or live with them; They are ashamed of the backlash they will receive from society for letting their son go down this road; they are also afraid they may not be able to talk to their daughter-in-law due to language issues (they know English, but are not super comfortable with it and my GF knows no other languages except English) or live with me as a family. I'm caught between wanting to just marry my girlfriend and the incredible guilt I feel from watching my parents cry. I do not want to give up family or my girlfriend, but the guilt is eating me alive and is leaving me depressed. This has been going on for months now, with no end in sight.

Has anyone here married a foreigner or know someone that has? What's your story? What were your struggles, regrets, and successes?

We have received all amounts into our bank account except the transactions  on PhonePe even though it showed ""Transaction Completed/Successful"" on  the customer's phone.  
 After checking all bank statements and tallying everything we have tried  to contact PhonePe customer support but they make you dance around from  their merchant call center to their regular call center and are all  very rude to you on the phone.  
In the end they told us that it isn't their problem and that we should go and contact our bank. After speaking to the bank also, it is very clear that this is an issue with PhonePe.

It is impossible to contact any of the customers who paid from PhonePe as the transaction doesnt even exist and there is no way of getting their information.

  
 To those reading this, please be wary of such applications that are run by criminal management. Have any of you had this problem? How does one go about getting their funds back? PhonePe has clearly washed their hands off us."

Having never worked in a startup-like environment I would really appreciate some advice on the following things which would help me make a better choice. If any of you are current or former employees of Oyo that would be even better !

1. I've been reading a bit about Oyo in Reddit and one post talks about how Oyo is fudging numbers to show false growth. How true is this claim ? Not that it matters to a software dev but I would like to know what kind of a company I'm planning to work at.
2. How is the work culture ? One of the complaints about by current company is that its not very adaptive to latest tech. So it is pretty important to me that I get the freedom to choose what tech I want to use.
3. I read somewhere that you might be asked to work on Saturdays. Is this true ? If yes, how frequently does that happen ?

AskIndia,So my abusive dad just pulled out a knife in a heated argument. Is this OK?,"Possible trigger warning I guess. 

This is not fiction. This just happened and I'm fucking shaking. I'm not a troll. I'm 17 years old(boy). I posted here a couple of hours ago showing the video footage that I was able to take during the scene. My question is- is this ok? If I had continued recording and didn't put my phone away, he probably would've stabbed me. After that I ran off to the bathroom, and he pushed the door multiple times. I was fucking shaking and managed to called my mother and she came thankfully. Now I could write pages about how my father has abused me since my childhood, but I'm really looking for some advice to what to do from the older, wiser people of reddit who have been through abuse. I have discussed with my mother and will be moving in with her in another city where she lives with her aunt and uncle. We already booked the tickets on redbus. We discussed this for a long hour. Now, in short my father is very controlling and abusive towards anyone who disobeys his every order. Several times over my entire childhood, he has had outbursts at night, beating and threatening to kill my mother and tonight me. So yeah, I'm really anxious while typing this. It's 1:30 am right now and I'm packing. We have a bus tomorrow at night but I am afraid he might do something in the mean time. My mother, who has suffered the same things when we were little says it's best to just ignore him. But today he just pulled out a knife and I was scared for my life. How long should we just ignore criminals? How long until something like this happens. Please I want some realistic advice here. I've been ignoring him for a long time now, I think this time something definitely needs to be done. 

Edit:

PS: More specifically he pulled out two knives and asked me to fight him. I put it down immediately. I was also recording at the time as nowadays whenever he gets in a bad mood and starts looking for me I start to record. I put away the phone coz I was terrified for my life. I couldn't record much after that. I managed to get the record up here(check post history) while I was hiding in the bathroom.

My mother has told me it is my fault repeatedly. I get how I might have provoked him a little, but I literally never talk to the guy, he is always the one who starts all this, including this one. I generally close the door when he's home for obvious reasons. This time he came into the room and shouted something and opened the door. I wanted to keep the door closed. I told him a bit annoyingly and that started everything basically. I actually have more recordings with me. 

And yes, some of you may think I'm exaggerating, or I'm only telling my side of the story. Check out the video in my post history that I uploaded from the bathroom(and after that I managed to call my mother and she came immediately). I am trying to give the fairest view on this as I can.

If you have any questions, please ask.

Edit: I hid the video sorry.

Edit 2: unhidded

Edit 3: Deleted the video from this account for fear of being misused. I still have it on my Google Drive and phone storage tho."

For the past 15 days, I've been encountering problems in UPI. These include - 

1. Transactions straight up failing.

2. Those which are initiated fail for some reason- bank servers not responding, UPI ID provider failing.

3. Ones which pass this dont complete in an instant, it says 'will take 3-5 days to process'


1 in 50 transaction successfully happens for me. I've been encountering problems on both PhonePe and Google Pay so obviously I think the problem lies with the underlying UPI Tech. Fortunately I haven't lost any money.

AskIndia,Why India's system sucks?,"Ok...This is a real story happened in my life.
We are a middle class family and my dad worked hard to raise our family. He became a dealer of a motorcycle business and he is my role model and superhero. In 2018 using his hard earned money and a loan he planned to get a own house. Bought a land and appointed a mestri(head workman) for the house. 

In July, that mestri appointed a old person for transferring cement bags from one floor to another floor. He didn't eat properly the before day and that day he also didn't eat before coming to work. After transferring few bags he took rest my mom thought of giving him butter milk so when she went to get that from my old home that worker fainted and died. 

Emergency ambulance people came and verified that the person is died and the policemen came and asked something and told that nothing to worry. His people took his body. So we all thought that everything is completed and continued our normal life.

The very next day so many people from his caste and his relatives came and occupied the nearby streets and road. My mom was worried so she with her brother went to the person who is reputed person of our caste but that person started talking wrongly about my mom and her brother. The watchman at the construction went away with his family. Relatives didn't come to help. My dad came from other town at that evening. He went to the police station along with the other person from other caste for support. Police constable started framing wrong stories. The so called reputed person from our caste started supporting the died person caste people. The police man started talking vulgarly and he beated my dad with his belt. They refused to do postmortem. They told that if dad gives 9 lakh rupees to the other caste members then only they will do the postmortem.

So my dad had to pay 9 lakhs the very next day and the police agreed for postmortem. In the postmortem report it was stated that the person who died has heart and digestion problems. 


From that day I started considering caste as a filthy term. Loosing money is not the issue but seeing my dad in that position is the major heart break for me. He refused to fight against that because he is afraid of the system. Ofterall we are middle class OC people.


Sorry for stating about castes and sorry for grammar and length."

It would do wonders for my mental health if I could at least diagnose it at this point after years of being 99% certain that I have it.

She started off in Java but was gradually move into some tool called SevOne or InfoVista. The work culture is so toxic and her manager is disrespectful that she has lost her confidence. She is scared to even give interviews saying she knows nothing and feels that she will embarrass herself. 

She has reached a stage where she doesn't want to work in IT. But I feel that because of this one experience she feels she isn't good enough. I suggested that she needs to try working in another company before she takes any such decision. 

What can she do to feel confident again? Is there any certification course in Java that will boost her profile and confidence? Kindly help."
AskIndia,"I (Male, 21) recently met a girl (22) and now she wants me to promise that I'll marry her only and noone else. What should i do?","I recently met this girl, we talked a lot on phone and met a couple of time. I like her and apparently she likes me too, probably too much. Today she asked me to promise that I'll marry her only and noone else, otherwise she won't carry this relationship forward. She was serious about it. She says she'll be deeply devastated if we don't marry at the end. Also her father is bringing 'rishta' and photos of guys for arranged marriage, so we have to come to a decision. 

I like her but obviously I'm not too sure about her. I barely know her as a person. Moreover, i can't marry at this age and also don't want someone to wait for me. 

What should i do?

Edit: She is not really a arrange-marriage-doer kind of girl. She is a Delhi girl coming from a wealthy and modern family. I didn't expect she would behave like this."

AskIndia,"(Mechanical) Engineers, was it worth pursuing a post-graduate in India?","Mechanical Engineer here. I graduated in 2018 with good grades from a reputed college in Bangalore. My degree certificate says ""First Class with Distinction"".

But I don't feel like I learned anything in my time as an undergraduate. The faculty were utterly useless and did little to stir interest amongst the students in the subjects they taught. Nor did my professors ever know anything outside their textbooks, even going so far as to preach outright lies because that's how they'd always been doing it for all these years. The only thing I feel like I got out of my experiences in college were all the projects I did. Being a student allowed me participate in 4 racing events. That's all I feel like I reaped from my undergraduate education.

I'm not here to shit on the Indian education system, because I know enough of that is done on the internet. I've been working for a year, and I feel like it's time to pursue a Post Graduate degree. None of the bigger, well paying companies in the mechanical/automobile/aerospace sector really pay any attention to undergraduates anyway, and they usually end up with dead end supervisor roles (or so I'm told).

So should I even bother trying to pursue an Mtech in Mechanical Engineering from an Indian university? I've heard that it isn't worth it unless you get it from an IIT or BITS. Mind you, some people tell me that the teaching there is shit too.

I've started to shift my focus abroad. But I know studying abroad means working abroad to pay off my student loans. I'm not a big fan of that idea, and don't want to spend a significant portion of my youth outside the country. There are a lot of personal reasons behind that. (Don't worry, I'm not forsaking my career for a girl)

Sorry you had to read all that. I'll finally get to my question. Was it worth doing an Mtech (specifically in M.E.) in India? Did you end up getting a good job? If you did it abroad, did you end up spending a long time there? Were you able to pay off your student loans easily?

Of course I know each individual case is different, and it all depends on how well you study. I'm just a little lost and could use some guidance. Thank you!"

AskIndia,"[Question] Have you ever been in a situation where after handing cash to a person, they simply forget? What did you do after that?","On my way back from college today, a female passenger accused the bus conductor of not returning the amount that belonged to her. She said she handed him a 100 rupee note (for 9 rupee fare) but he only returned her the change for 10.

Immediately, the other passengers chimed in support of the girl (she was wearing some school uniform). But no one really was looking when the actual exchange happened. The other bus conductor vehemently supported his colleague's version of the story. As did the girl for her own.

She was sitting behind me so I also didn't see anything, as I was standing facing the head of a man facing the window (don't ask).

I don't know who is the liar or who simply forgot to pay atttention. In the end the girl did not get her money back.

When you think about it, cash -- being a bearer instrument, is kinda flawed when there are no cameras around. If I think about it, something like this has happened to me also. I paid someone cash but it never registered in their memory. But I got back what was mine. And that's because I was ready to fight to the death for a pittance. Humanity and straight explanation doesn't fly where I live.

In your state, do bus conductors do this thing were they take large note from passenger, and then run to the gate in order to beckon other passengers, and then come back to give the change?

Anyway, I was just wondering. Has something like this happened with you at other places?"

ABD (i don't consider myself confused), I'm looking for interesting Indian music that isn't from popular films. I would make exceptions for music from films that is particularly interesting or different, not your standard dance numbers or romantic songs. 

&amp;nbsp;

I was recently listening to the Dil Se soundtrack and found it really interesting, dynamic and quite different from your average bollywood movie! The music is not standard and even the production is not standard, there's a lot of dynamism in the tracks. For example, in Satarangi Re it starts off with that high pitch vocal singing and then suddenly breaks into the beat. I found it really great. 

&amp;nbsp;

Anyways, I also would love to find Indian music that isn't from movies. Like, is there a vibrant musician scene in India that isn't what we get internationally? Any hidden bands you really like that wouldn't have a chance to be marketed abroad? I'd also be interested in folk recordings. I'm not particularly interested in Classical music because those are quite easy to find and plentiful. 


&amp;nbsp;

Things I'm not looking for:

* Dance beat songs
* autotuned vocals
* highly repetitive lyrics

HITK is situated in Kolkata a metropolitan city, it's a more rushed life with more opportunities in proffesional and social life and my girlfriend lives there. We have been in a committed relationship for 4 years and it's going strong, I do not want to risk that, which will definitely happen if I go to JGEC which is 600km away from Kolkata.

Both the colleges have similar faculties but JGEC is a government college which makes it's placements better, also the govt tag is a big thing.

Truthfully I do not care about the placements as I'm determined to go for GATE and a masters degree. The primary concern about studying in the private college is the fee which is considerably higher than a govt college and putting that pressure on my parents seems morally evil. 

But my relationship is a high priority in my life and I do not want to loose a girl so mature and understanding in a world almost deviod of true feelings. I want to lead a hard-working productive life but also want my relationship to survive. I just can't understand what decision I should take. 

If I choose JGEC and my relationship breaks and I don't have my peace of my mind, it'll be a huge regret but then again giving my parents the financial trouble, it's a freaking chaos in my mind. Can someone please help, please. Advices, personal incidents, every insight is welcome."

AskIndia,"Those who come from conventional middle class families and are in open marriages, how do you overcome your conflicts?","Many of us have grown up with families where our parents' relationships were fairly simple and love was chopping vegetables for your wife after coming home from work or making tea for him when he looks blue. Anything hanky panky like open marriage, polyamory, dont ask dont tell, hall pass etc. was unthinkable. 

Cut to today, we are surrounded by people who do practice such marriages (sometimes openly) and some people are into successful open marriages. 

Those, who come from conventional families where the love between parents was strictly monogamous, here are some things I was wondering

1. Do you compare their relationship with yours? 
2. Does your partner come from a similar family background? 
3. If you follow a ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy, do you sometimes wonder who they may be with or get insecure?

2. Apache RTR 160: Have test ridden only the RTR 200 and it felt pretty powerful although a little uncomfortable. Has amazing brakes, one tap and the bike freezes on spot.

AskIndia,Citibank NEFT issues (pathetic bank),"So a friend transferred me 42K on 25th July for buying cell phone from me, and I haven't received it yet.

His account is debited and his bank (HDFC) also told him that they have transferred the money. He also sent me screenshot with reference number.

Then I called my bank (CITI) today and they said that my transaction is put on hold for some screening. They raised a complaint and said they will follow up but this process will take around 7 fucking days.

I am fed up of this Citibank. WTF is the screening process? They didn't send any email notification to me that a transaction is on hold. They are just sitting on that money. What if this money was needed for some urgent purpose?

&amp;#x200B;

And they gave me another headache few months ago. I transferred 5k to an Instagram shop for some designer dress that my wife wanted. The bank sent me emails and called me saying I should give them birth date of the account holder else they will freeze my account after 1 month. I had to get the details from that Instagram guy and they finally removed the warning. Its so fucking frustrating to use Citibank. Are other banks this shit? Should I complain to RBI about this crap?"

Plan is to spend the first 3 days in the city (visiting family) and then the next 10-12 days on the road trip. I do prefer the mountains but I've already driven to Lonavalla and Ooty. Preferably would love to see the Himalayas so might fly to Delhi and then take a rental from there though that adds additional steps that might not be convenient (got a handicapped 5 year old). Plus worried about pollution **points at kid**. Both me and my wife are photographers and want to stay away from city life. Any recommendations are welcome. I initially wanted to ask this on the team-bhp forum but they keep refusing to accept my registration... ugh!!

AskIndia,We really need to talk about Flairs.,"Hello /r/india  
  
Here are some clarifications on submission flairs, since we see a lot of mis-flaired posts from time to time.  
  
**[P] - Political**  
  
These are for political posts only. If a post involved any politician, political party or anything primarily related to politics, then it must be flaired as political  
  
**[NP] - Non-political**  
  
These are for discussions where you are confident there is no politics involved. You cannot flair a post that is primarily or tangentially related to politics with an NP tag.  
 
This is important because quite a few people use the filters we have on the sidebar to filter out political (or non-political) posts, and misflairing one as the other may irritate these users.  
  
**[R] - Reddiquette**  
  
When this flair is selected, Reddit's Reddiquette guidelines are enforced in the thread, along with certain other restrictions so as to have a slightly higher quality discussion.    
  
Jokes, puns and low effort comments will be removed in such threads.
  
This can be used for both political and non-political topics.  
  
**[ASK] - AskIndia**  
  
These are flairs for self-posts where the OP wants to ask the community a question. You cannot use this flair for link posts (because that makes no sense unless ToI or HT wants to ask /r/india a question).  
  
If the question is political in nature, then the thread must be flaired with P or R, not with AskIndia. This is to prevent filters from being breached.  
  
**Science & Technology** 

This flair is for topics with an explicit, mostly non-political science & technology bent to it. If it tangentially involves politics, it is fine to use this flair in place of [P].   
 
If Modi makes a comment about the ISRO, then it is a P thread.  
If the ISRO conducts some research that points to where state governments can improve with irrigation, and a politician comments on that, then it can be flaired with Science & Technology assuming the primary focus of the story isn't the politician's comment.  

**Policy & Economy**
  
These flairs work similarly. The main topic of the subject matter should be about policy or economy. The instant the focus shifts to politics, political parties, politicians, etc. the flair must be [P].  

**Business & Finance**  

These flairs are for articles, or self-post submissions with a non-political, business bent to them. If you want to know where to invest or if Ola Cabs decides to go public, then this is the flair for you.  
  
**Entertainment** 

Entertainment flair is exclusively for pop-culture links, submissions, and discussions. Examples under this flair include movie trailers, movie clips, comics, YouTube joke sketches and things along those lines.  
  
This flair cannot be used for some politician saying something absurd, funny or ridiculous. That constitutes an editorialization of the title on the part of the OP - since the OP insinuates that the subject matter is funny with the title (instead of letting the reader make up their mind).   
 
**Sports and Food** 

Sports & Food flairs are very self-explanatory  

**AMA**
  
AMA flairs are given to OPs who verify their identity with the mod team. In case they choose not to verify, they will get an **Unverified** flair.  
  
**In-Depth**

This flair must be used carefully.This flair *only* used when you need an In-depth discussion about the topic. Top comments must have a proper explanation/discussion about the top. Top comments must fulfil the word limit else the comment **will** get deleted by all mighty automod.

---  
PS - In the event of confusion, just go for Reddiquette.
  
Recommendations for new flairs may be made below.  "

I have seen people come, go, do shit and leave without giving a shit, and all I did all the while is work my ass off, without any major returns. I get my salary every month, that's it. 

I used to get 12 offs in a year, last years I utilised only 5 of those, 3 of those because I was sick. After all that, my boss tells me for one error, not a critical error, that I was all my work was trash, I was useless and a loser. I mean, he screamed at me for 2 days, so there really is no point going into the details. 

So, I quit. I didn't get angry. But I could not let my hard work get disrespected as much. My boss expected me to fix my error, and continue working as if nothing had happened. 

But now, I wonder. Did I do the right thing? I am not sad about leaving honestly, I feel like I can breathe again, but how do Indian (I don't know about people outside) bosses feel they can treat their employees like shit and everything can be ok post that?

That being said, I don't think I wanna continue studying mechanical (I'm sure I can self-study starting from inter-physics, inter-mathematics concepts but I don't feel like doing that). 

However, based on other people's advice and my desire into doing something else tangible and 'job secure', I wanna get into something computer science related. Idk shit about this but I've seen the word 'coding' thrown around a lot. 

Now, I have one year to make myself employable in this field. Will I have to study four years worth of what computer science engineering students study? If not, what should I study? I know it's a pipe dream to learn everything in an year, I just wanna plan like I wanna be job ready in an year and then study on own pace.

Is CS a good career choice? If it is, what specifically should I start studying? Is there any specific beginner books you recommend that'll help me get started?

AskIndia,How do I transliterate a dynamic page from English to Marathi/Hindi?,"So this is a slightly technical question that requires more detail than the title.

I own a restaurant that receives orders on Swiggy, Zomato, Dunzo and other online platforms. Due to the aggregator restrictions, I can only receive and display orders in my restaurant in English. However, my staff cannot read English and is unable to process orders until someone reads it out to them.

I tried the Google translate plugin, but it's only about 60% accurate and it's unable to translate some specific terms like ""Sriracha"" or ""Chipotle"" and absolutely butchers other terms like ""pizza pockets"" or ""hot dog"". I also cannot customise the output of the plugin

What I'm looking for is a way to transliterate the words phonetically for each menu item. So, for example, ""burger"" should display as ""बर्गर"" and ""hot dog"" should display as ""हॉट डॉग"".

This will allow my staff to read the items and prepare the order without intervention from English speakers. The order page interface is also dynamic, and new orders need to be transliterated as they come in. The Google translate plugin automatically translates new orders, but again it's terribly inaccurate.

Would really appreciate any help from you guys on this. I'm sure many other restaurants face similar problems and require a similar solution. Thanks in advance."

On a first glance, the app looks brilliant. A testament to what a proper UX flow should be, with a simplified option to manage your cards and make payments. So, I've gone ahead and made a payment which should reflect in some time. Now, on a hunch, I checked the app reviews and they are absolutely horrible. You can scroll through pages after pages and won't even find a 2 star rating for the app. And all this is giving me an uneasy feeling.

The app is made by the freecharge team, so I kind of trusted it but now feeling a bit unwary. So, have any of you used this app? How credible and fast is the process of payments? Honestly, I don't care much about the rewards but was drawn towards the ability to pay credit card bills using upi from a single platform. So, please let me know your experiences with this app."

I know that accepting a counter offer is always not advised.

AskIndia,"(Serious) Need some advice, can't keep up.","So, I am in 11th right now in some shitty CBSE school. I absolutely hate this school with a passion, always have and always will - God awful teachers, Autistic students, Just an all-out horrible place to be. I also go to a Coaching center that prepares for JEE Mains/Advanced, unlike my school, I actually like this place a lot. I'd much rather study in there than my poor excuse of a school.   


Getting to the point, I just can't keep up with work from both the School and my Coaching classes. To a point where I'd it's affecting me mentally. I just wish to study for the JEE at the coaching center where I have pretty damn good teachers and students that don't have their frontal lobe missing, don't wish to hassle with Schoolwork that has absolutely no worth whatsoever. Are there any options for me? Maybe being a Private candidate or going to an Open school? I am already a month in, took PCMCS, got a terrible 72% in 10th. Life seems pretty hopeless right now  


I in all honestly, couldn't care less about grades. As long as I learn, that's all I care about. I love theories and the 11th - 12th syllabus is pretty good at least in that department"

AskIndia,Looking for places to make a trip during independence day week in North India,So I am meeting some of my cousins after a long time this indepence day week and I'm planning on going on a trip with them. But the thing is they're a little bit choosy about places. They want to visit some place in North India. And they have already been to kashmir and sikkim. They also don't want metro city areas like Delhi or nearby places like Agra since we want the trip to last for at least 4 days with some scenic beauty. Is there any place like that in North India to visit during independence day week? What are the chances of those places getting rainfall around that time? A senior member of family is also going to accompany us so I don't want to do hiking.

AskIndia,Need help about a land dispute. (Please spare some time to read),"I have a very old house, that was built in the 1950s. The neighbours built theirs much later, and they did some trespassing in the name of expansion. As my mother lived there alone, she tried her best to fight, but they built the building while obstructing some of our land.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, we are building a new, bigger house on our land. We are using every inch of our land. This means the neighbours' windows would be rendered useless as they'll be completely covered. The same people now came to us and requested to leave some margin while we're building. We don't want to leave any of our land.

&amp;#x200B;

So the other party is resorting to verbal abuses &amp; threats. We think they're just trying to invoke a reaction from us, so that they can somehow delay our construction work. We have all the papers of our land and our house, so we are legally in the right. This means they'll not take a legal action and thus I guess they want us to make a mistake (e.g. a physical attack). We want to avoid a legal action as we have had a pathetic experience with the judiciary. But I am just worried they don't do something illegal.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for this long post again, but I am really worried. We are honest, working, middle-class people. What should we do? Is legal action the only way forward?"

AskIndia,I'm a male[23] need advice.,"Around the age of nine, I believed my father was the richest man in town for he would say things like, ""I smoke more cigarettes than what you make in a month "". That is a really obnoxious thing to say to somebody but as a nine year old I thought that's what rich people say and the neighborhood where I grew up in which is a little town in the Northeast, is full of gamblers, and unfortunately, my father was one.

My father worked in the department of agriculture but couldn't save none. When I was around 14 years old, my father sold our house for only five lakh rupees, my mother battled everyday, reached out to people to convince him not to but nobody helped and I didn't understand anything about it, neither did my elder sister who was 17 at the time.

He never encouraged us to study and the neighborhood didn't inspire it either and consequently we hardly cleared our matriculation. After that, no college for us.

It was around 2012 when I got my first cell phone which was a Chinese phone with a 2g network (took 40 mins or something to download a 4mb song), with that phone, I taught myself everything I know, I can safely say I learned from that phone more than what I learned in school. 

I started confronting my father when I turned 17 or something about what he did to us and he always said things like, ""I don't earn for you, I earn for myself"", ""when I die, you'll get enough money from the government to build a house and live happily"".

Which wasn't true. My father died back in 2017 and now we're told to leave the quarter. They let us live for two years but not anymore.

I was never forced to go out and work and with a 10 pass certificate, I'm not going to find any work either. Shit has hit the fan. We got some 15 lakh from the office and paid 2.5 lakh for some loan he had, now with that little budget we can't imagine building a house in this age, plus my sister is unmarried.

I love my mother so much, I loved my father as well despite what kind of a person he was, he was my father nevertheless. But my mother, she's my life. If it wasn't for my mother, i would've ended this life.

My relatives stopped calling us a year later my father's death lest we ask them for help.

It's just 3 of us now, nobody comes to our house anymore, my father's work colleagues who used to treat me like a son now passes me by like I'm some stranger.

Life is bleak with no hope in sight. I'm soon to be 24 with no prior experience in work. I've been told to move out of the town but i can't imagine living my mother and sister in a place where there's no one to take care of them.

I dream about 3 of us killing ourselves. I hope it doesn't come to pass.

My father never let me work, not even go to market and get groceries because he thought I'm a fool, i can't use money. I squandered my life away. I work in our locality but it's not work in the traditional sense, i just help out people for little to no money.

What can I do? I don't hope to make my mother proud, I just want a stable life and always be there for my mother.

My nearest city is Guwahati. There I might my some work but again, can't leave them here and I a city like Guwahati, where average rent is 10k+, all of us can't move there either.

How do I make thing work, how do I make myself work?

How do you go out and find work? I have no real world experience. I used to have a really good friend, thought he was my best friend but that's not true. He stopped hanging out with me.

I play ludo with my mother and sister to keep them distracted of our imminent dark days.

#####Precautions for prevention of Corona Virus
^Currently ^there ^is ^no ^vaccine ^available ^to ^protect ^against ^human ^corona ^virus ^but ^we ^can ^reduce ^the ^transmission ^of ^virus ^by ^taking ^following ^precautions:

1. Wash your hands frequently
2. Practice respiratory hygiene. Cover mouth and nose with a medical mask, tissue, or flexed elbow when coughing or sneezing. Wash hands afterwards and discard mask or tissue.
3. Maintain social distancing
4. Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth
5. If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical care early. Consult a doctor.
6. As a general precaution, practice general hygiene measures when visiting live animal markets, wet markets or animal product markets
7. Avoid consumption of raw or undercooked animal products
8. If you become sick while travelling, inform crew, seek medical attention early and share travel history.

#####How to Quarantine Yourself via [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/health/self-quarantine-coronavirus.html)
^If ^you’re ^returning ^from ^an ^area ^that’s ^had ^a ^coronavirus ^outbreak, ^or ^if ^you’ve ^been ^in ^close ^contact ^with ^someone ^who ^tests ^positive, ^you ^may ^be ^asked ^to ^isolate ^yourself ^at ^home ^for ^two ^weeks, ^the ^presumed ^incubation ^period ^for ^the ^coronavirus.

^It’s ^not ^easy ^to ^lock ^yourself ^away ^from ^your ^family ^and ^friends. ^These ^are ^the ^basics.

1. **ISOLATION**: If you are infected or have been exposed to the coronavirus, you must seclude yourself from your partner, your housemates, your children, your older aunt and even your pets. If you don’t have your own room, one should be designated for your exclusive use. No visitors unless it’s absolutely essential. Don’t take the bus, subway or even a taxi.

2. **MASKS**: If you must be around other people — in your home, or in a car, because you’re on your way to see a doctor (and only after you’ve called first) — wear a mask. Everyone else should, too.

3. **HYGIENE**: Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue to cough or sneeze, and discard it in a lined trash can. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. You can use sanitizer, but soap and water are preferred. Wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, if you haven’t just washed them.

4. **DISINFECTING**: Don’t share dishes, drinking glasses, eating utensils, towels or bedding. Wash these items after you use them. Use a household cleaner to wipe down countertops, tabletops, doorknobs, bathrooms fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets and bedside tables. That also goes for any surfaces that may be contaminated by bodily fluids.

5. **HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS**: When around the patient, wear a face mask, and add gloves if you’re touching anything that might carry the patient’s bodily fluids. Dispose of the mask and gloves immediately. The older members and those with chronic medical conditions should minimize contact with the secluded individual.

Literally any pirated 1080p stream will be better than Hotstar.

Now, people here really hate DTH connections and for good reasons, however those reasons don't apply for sports channels. You won't get ads in football, and you'll get ads in Cricket on Hotstar too. Further, the new TRAI regulations made packs costlier for those who want many channels, but really cheap for those who only buy it for few channels. You can just get rid of any base pack you're given, and need to pay a monthly fee of 153 rupees for Network Charges, and 23 rupees for Star Sports 1 HD and 23 rupees for Sony Ten 1 HD, paying less than 200 rupees per month in total.

The video quality on DTH is much better as compared to Hotstar or Sonyliv, plus you save on your internet data."

Sports,Top 10 Mouth Shutting Yorkers in Cricket History!,
Sports,My ex-company(a giant MNC) wants me to pay notice period recovery amount even when I didn't propose the last working day.,"TLDR/I quit my desk job, since I want to pursue adventure sport of paragliding as a living.I resigned, Manager accepted & he proposed a relieving date - all on email.The company wants me to pay notice period shortfall.

I absolutely do NOT want to pay the notice period shortfall.

**How do I go about this?**

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is indeed long, but please read through for details-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The sequence of events in summary:

1. I resigned (official email date 1st January 2019), requested a relieving date from my Manager.
2. My Manager confirmed resignation acceptance & **he proposed the last working day as 28th February 2019**, on email (HR in copy).
3. Per discussion with the Manager, I completed my handover of projects/documentation. I complete last work day formalities & wait for full and final settlement.
4. On March 25th, HR tells me I have to pay a notice period shortfall waiver of 1 month. (citing notice period in contract being 3 months & I have served 2 months )
5. I try to explain, that the date was NOT proposed by me. I followed notice period as advised by the manager & as discussed between me & the manager.
6. They say - Whatever is written in contract takes precedence. Moreover HR cites that the Manager did not explicitly mention in email that the notice period is waived off. I have to pay if I have to clear the dues for the retirals to be processed.
7. Furthermore, HR says this matter is upto discretion of the management ( Management = Centre head of the premises I worked at)
8. My manager is spineless, but I have brought in level-up manager (American) in the communication chain & I would be meeting the centre head in about 9-10 days. (he is out of India right now)

\---

&#x200B;

I have worked for the company for past 6 years. (Out of total 11 years of my total work experience)The company is an Indian division of a giant European MNC.

About a decade ago, the Indian division was mostly a manufacturing facility in Gujarat.

Our centre head is someone who is a veteran from that setup & mostly runs the centre basis same factory-driven-mindset, with loads of hierarchy & ""well set"" grooves and ""network"" of managers.  
That is not how the MNC functions outside India, but the P&L centre shows profit every year, so I guess the counterparts don't interfere.

Since I received the ""Notice period shortfall recovery email"" from HR in March 2019, I have been escalating the issue & seeking a waiver on it, since it was not my suggestion to have a 2 month notice period.

&#x200B;

HR Manager's manager had this overall input ""It is a *small* amount.. You should part ways on good note..""

The HR manager's manager borderline threatened me for the escalation with

""Do you want us to tell **this** when we get a call for background check anytime in the future?""

&#x200B;

He also mentioned, that this is the process they follow & ultimate discretion lies with management now.

So, I figured, it is pointless talking to him.*I did some digging and there was this IT/Systems in charge fellow who resigned recently. He served the notice period & for whatever reason, his manager let him go 2 days earlier, that too with a record on email.Still, he was asked to pay 2 days worth of notice period recovery amount, before his dues were cleared!!He paid it up since he was supposed to leave abroad for his next job & it was a small amount which he didn't want to hold up the larger settlement dues over that.*

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It simply blows my mind, that a company like such is actually hell bent on making money off notice period shortfalls, especially where the parting is mutual & hasn't even caused any business harm/loss or lack of transfer of work.

I absolutely do **NOT** want to pay the notice period shortfall.**How do I go about this?**

I was thinking about:

1. Writing to the ombudsperson (reporting helpline for intercompany disputes) - to get some global heat in this.
2. Writing about this to as many functional head & Global HR email addresses I can gather to just get this escalated so much, that it cannot be just pressed down.
3. Getting lawyer's opinion on this. (I would really like to avoid any legal proceeding, since that would call for a lot of work, time, money!)

*Tips:*

1. Believe only the verified information from reliable source.
2. Be careful and alert in public, keep an eye out for sick, coughing peoples nearby.
3. Keep distance from people. Can be friends or colleagues.
4. Careful buying food, groceries etc. don't touch foods if you don't have to.
5. Wash hands [properly](https://www.who.int/gpsc/media/how_to_handwash_lge.gif).
6. Avoid Handshakes, Use verbal greetings instead.
7. Cough within [elbow angle](https://images.megapixl.com/1783/17830764.jpg).
8. Don't touch anything if you don't have to e.g. Bus, Train, vehicle poles and door handles.
9. Carry Hand sanitizer if you can.
10. Apply the sanitizer on area you touch like ATM, bus poles or other public used things you need to touch. ( little awkwardness in public is better than getting sick )
11. Non-essential gathering in large groups must be avoided. e.g. sport events, concerts, meetups etc.
12. Get more information from [WHO.int](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) or other verified research institute.
13. suggest..

*Thoughts:*

Personally called few numbers to correct the map address. Found out in gMap they had different names. So please check the map links and make sure you're going to right address. Before calling them do your research. ""Get  info"" calls can make a line busy and  real people in need suffers.

When calling few centers myself, a person received my call asking if they are the govt assigned center to test corona, he got scared at first just by hearing the name. Which made me wonder how less information he might have about the pandemic. I hope you get all the right information about this threat. Wash hands as much you should, definitely more. And please be kind to others, if you feel sick of corona symptoms please do not take it lightly. Get help, ask for help. Do use mask, self hygiene, self quarantine and don't spread. You might spread it to your family and friends first (the closest we get ) so most of all don't be a dick. We can fight this by fighting the urge to get close to people washing hands.

These are the collection of data from various resources.

# Corona virus - What it is?

Novel - First time human immunity system is being exposed to this virus

Corona virus - Family of viruses with crown shape

**Symptoms**

Please **monitor your temperature if you have dry cough**. If you get high temperature & any of the mentioned symptoms in point 2, please seek medical advise. In a case, if you have sore throat , please practice social distancing and isolate yourself.

The “incubation period” means the time between catching the virus and  beginning to have symptoms of the disease. Most estimates of the  incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, most commonly  around five days. These estimates will be updated as more data become  available.

The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are

1. **fever, tiredness, and dry  cough** (The AND is important point to note\*\*)\*\*.
2. Some patients may have **aches and pains**, **nasal congestion**, **runny  nose**, **sore throat** or **diarrhea (Apart from mentioned above)**.
3. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually.
4. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell.
5. **Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease  without needing special treatment**.
6. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.
7. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood  pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop  serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing  should seek medical attention.

**Spreading**

People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose  or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales.  These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other  people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then  touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if  they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or  exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter  (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.

**Asymptomatic Spreading**

&#x200B;

1. If a person is asymptomatic, it is highly that he is not communicating the disease till he follows a good personal hygiene.

The main way the disease spreads is **through respiratory droplets**  expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from  someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many people with  COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the  early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19  from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel  ill.  WHO is assessing ongoing research on the period of transmission of  COVID-19 and will continue to share updated findings. 

# How to protect yourself

You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:

&#x200B;

1. **WASH your hands** : Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.
2. Maintain at least 1 meter (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.Why?  When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from  their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you  can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person  coughing has the disease.
3. Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.Why?  Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated,  hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there,  the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.
4. Make sure  you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This  means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when  you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.Why?  Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you  protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and  COVID-19.
5. Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever,  cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in  advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.Why?  National and local authorities will have the most up to date information  on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your  health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility.  This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other  infections.
6. Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19  hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is      spreading  widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places  – especially if you are  an older person      or have diabetes, heart or lung disease.Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.
7. Self - isolation period should be 5-14 days.[Guidelines for Home Quarantine](https://www.mohfw.gov.in/pdf/Guidelinesforhomequarantine.pdf)
8. Please call ahead if you are visiting a doctor.

**Please make sure if you use mask , you know how to handle it. Incorrect handling and using of mask will lead you in troubles (touching front of the mask, not disposing it , touching mask again and again to adjust it)**

Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially  coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19. Disposable  face mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or looking after  someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is a world-wide  shortage of masks, so WHO urges people to use masks wisely.

WHO advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary wastage of precious resources and mis-use of masks  ([see Advice on the use of masks](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks)).

The  most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are  to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow  or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from  people who are coughing or sneezing. See  [basic protective measures against the new coronavirus](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks) for more information.

Guidelines for home qurantine

## Recommendations for travelers

It is prudent  for travelers who are sick to delay or avoid travel to affected areas,  in particular for elderly travelers and people with chronic diseases or  underlying health conditions.

General recommendations for  personal hygiene, cough etiquette and keeping a distance of at least one  meter from persons showing symptoms remain particularly important for  all travelers. These include:

* Perform hand hygiene  frequently, particularly after contact with respiratory secretions. Hand  hygiene includes either cleaning hands with soap and water or with an  alcohol-based hand rub. Alcohol-based hand rubs are preferred if hands  are not visibly soiled; wash hands with soap and water when they are  visibly soiled;
* Cover your nose and mouth with a flexed elbow or  paper tissue when coughing or sneezing and disposing immediately of the  tissue and performing hand hygiene;
* Refrain from touching mouth and nose;
* A  medical mask is not required if exhibiting no symptoms, as there is no  evidence that wearing a mask – of any type – protects non-sick persons.  However, in some cultures, masks may be commonly worn. If masks are to  be worn, it is critical to follow best practices on how to wear, remove  and dispose of them and on hand hygiene after removal (see [Advice on the use of masks](https://apps.who.int/iris/rest/bitstreams/1269003/retrieve))

As for any travel, travelers are also advised to follow proper food hygiene practices, including [the five keys for food safety](https://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/consumer/en/5keys_en.pdf?ua=1&ua=1), as well as [recommendations to reduce the risk of transmission of emerging pathogens from animals to human in live markets](https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus/who-recommendations-to-reduce-risk-of-transmission-of-emerging-pathogens-from-animals-to-humans-in-live-animal-markets).

Sports,Why isn’t scholastic wrestling not a part of extra curriculum in Indian Schools despite wrestling being a popular sport in Indian culture?,"Wrestling or kushti in hindi seems to be one of the most popular indian sports and martial art of India. The history of Akharas makes it look like India really is into wrestling. So much that often time whenever a normal indian fights you can see him using a crude style of wrestling.

But despite all the cultural history wrestling is not a sport ever present in Indian schools while American schools all have a good wrestling team with them.

This seems like a result of bad mentality among Indians that sports are a waste of time and study is everything that matters.

And most parents are so overprotective that they wouldn’t allow their ward to train in fear of him being hurt or injured?"

Sports,"As an NRI, my personal view on the Serious emigration thread.","Here is the original thread: https://old.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dcquo0/serious_emigration_threat_is_it_helpless_yet/

As a person emigrated to Germany, I want to chip in my personal view as to what it takes to make me come back to India. 

tl:dr; I won't be back as of now! May be in future!

Long version:

u/ozonised has compiled very good list of what issues exists and what can be improved.

Infrastructure: I come from Hyderabad and being a capital city the infrastructure is shit! It took more than 10 years and massive amount to build a metro, and that too it's over the top metro not an underground. The roads are already congested and these fools installed metro pillars in between the roads, congesting it even more. The city sewage is still from the Nizams era and nothing substantial has been done to improve it. Every year in rainy season, roads and buildings are submerged in water.

Ride bike for one hour, take a clean cloth and swipe on your face, a black layer come off. That's the pollution in the city. Auto and public busses emit black gases from exhaust! You are literally breathing that shit day in, day out. Just creating better transportation does not make a place livable. You need to plan for the future and build something sustainable! There is no greenery in the city and becoming concrete jungle! Every year when I visit Hyd, I regret roaming on the streets because of that black smoke.

Please make the city more livable. Yesterday there was news about cutting down trees in Aarey park, mumbai to make way for Metro! We need to progress and build infrastructure considering nature not the other way round. It takes just a strong will to inspect/make every person riding a vehicle to follows correct emission standards.

Healthcare:  
Healthcare is completely different topic. Last year, as a challenge to get an MRI for my Cervical Spondylosis problem, my father asked me to get it done in Osmania Hospital. I visited for 20 days and tried to get an appointment with a Neuro doctor and MRI without paying a bribe, sadly I gave up and got it done in a private hospital.

Have you ever visited the pregnant ward in any govt hospital? If you don't puke, I would congratulate you. Imagine women carrying a child for 9 months and then delivering among other 20 women in a congested room and pathetic conditions. Healthcare is literally on their knees.

- Did you know 2 years back Indian mangoes were banned in germany because they were using chemicals to ripe them! 

You know what can be done? Just a good officer and good inspection to keep premises clean and healthy. Checkout the amsterdam cycling documentaries, the govt responded to the public demand and created more cycling infrastructure, so that people can bikle freely and resulting in massive decline in health problems.

Academics: 
The plight of private schools looting parents came to mainstream due to Delhi govt. Kudos to them for bringing awareness. Private schools are robbing and public schools are getting closed due to lack of funds!! Govt has no money to run schools but they make a 3k crore statue. I saw some days back in UP, a school was serving rice with salt as mid-day meal. Are we in such a fucking pathetic situation that we can not give a curry/dal with rice for our future generations? Don't get me started on quality of education. Why can't govt schools have English subject? Why do they have to teach only in regional language? I saw many govt school students under confident when they start college.

In Germany I can study for free until my PG. I can work under professors and also get paid handsomely if I do research. You know what, as a student I pay just 52€(4000 INR) for one semester/6 months and can take part or play as many times. Open the following link with chrome and translate it. https://hsp-hh.sport.uni-hamburg.de/sportangprogramm.htm. It would be mind boggling to know every student in the city can take part in so many sports. You would be overwhelmed when you see the sport infrastructure this country has! I have never played any sport except cricket and thankfully to Germany I played so many sports you can't even imagine and that too almost free! 

You can also take as many courses you want by paying 110€(8k INR) for 6 months. When you earn more then 2.5k€ every month 110€ for 6 months is nothing! Why would I leave this and come back to nothing, where I can get sick just by breathing that shitty air?

Policies: Check out the startup culture here in Berlin and Munich area. In India, we have so many IIT's and lakhs of students graduating every year. What is stopping the Govt from creating a Startup fund and make policies that encourage the fresh minds to create fresh Ideas? They have a startup fund and I guess it has gone to the wind! 

Me, My elder brother and younger sister all are CS students. We are actually working on our startup that would be headquartered in Germany and branch out in India. Do you know why? because we get better funding here and exposure is fucking awesome! Every city has Startup hacks/meetups/pitches! I don't want to start our startup in the red tape of Indian bureaucracy. To be honest, It's a shame that in a country like India, we are lagging behind in Startup world!

Employment: Better startup policies, better infrastructure, better education directly leads to creating more opportunities! No magic wand. I am in my 20s and working on my company, there are lakhs of people like me, but sadly working that shitty 9-5 job in some big company. Just look around and see the jobs created by Zomato and Swiggy, the cash they brought into market from consumers. Imagine startups like these on a massive scale! It would change the face of our country. Our economy needs to be more open and welcoming!

My brother used to work in East Asia and came back to India and he regrets every day. The daily commute, traffic jams, pollution is literally killing him. As the first comment from u/mrfreeze2000 says, ""There are two types of people who emigrate: better pay/lifestyle, and better work"". I Emigrated because of both. You know Its Illegal to make me work on Sat & Sunday. If an exceptional situation arises that I have to work on Saturday, my company has to get permission from Labour office!

- I get 6 weeks of Paid holidays + public holidays
- I can travel 27 countries. Just pack your bags and hop in your car. Los geht's!
- I get PR after working for 3 years or 2 years with German B1 certificate. No Shitty visa issues like in US of A. 
- I can become German citizen in 6-8 years.
- I can take as many sickness leaves i want. It's my right. I dont do it, just saying.
- If my wife is working and expecting a child, she gets 14(fourteen) months of paid maternity leave. As a father you can also take paternity leave.
- My whole family is covered under my Health insurance covering from fever to cancer. 
- Children go to awesome schools here to learn, they can take music as a subject or any sport and all of this is free.
- If I ever got fired, I get arbeitslosengeld(Job Loss money), for 1.5 years I guess.
- Better infrastructure, better health and Hospitals, better care, better money, better air. 

Lastly, I guess this was written by non-muslim person(sorry to bring in Religion). As a muslim myself, my father urges me not to come back to India ever, given the cancer that has spread in recent years. I have desis saying to my face anti-national or paki here in Germany and least I expect that India. I stopped going to Indian festival gatherings here because I fear some dickhead will ask why I came there and what is my intention. Some years back I could trust my fellow Indians and now I lost that hope. Just for reference check this tweet (https://twitter.com/rohini_sgh/status/1180165971006197765), this is the cancer our country has acquired! You don't know the humiliation we are facing these days. Every damn thing has been turned into whataboutery. The current regime spined the propaganda about minority appeasement? What minority appeasement, muslims situation is worse than SC/ST's and that too without reservation. 

Why would I leave all these and come back to India to suck all that shit? I love my country and think of it now and then, but do I miss it? Nah! Do I miss the culture? absolutely yes! Do I want to come back and live there? Nope. Sorry.

Edit: Thanks u/kash_if for the silver!

Edit: If anyone needs help with any issues like job, education just message me. I would be happy to help."

Sports,MS Dhoni is most overrated indian player of all time,"MS Dhoni got lucky with great indian teammates who won the worldcup. He wasn't best indian team captain but he was captain of best Indian team(at WC winning).He got great cult following who are blind to see anything that looks bad on him so because of that Media sings his great endeavour all Time because criticism him would be bad for business. This why he got so strong in board that he basically do whatever the fuck he likes (you can't ignore some of the team selection which are done after 2011, *Gambhir*). He basically IS team selector and nobody wants to say anything because he is too powerful. Everybody is on his side in board. His performance is shit in last  two years(i think he should have retired somewhere around 2017)but still he makes every single cut. His performance in world cup 2019 is shit but nobody speaking anything because he may retire after worldcup and why risk it all to make a point and become target of internet mob(kudos to Sachin for criticizing him) 

He is gotten to a point where will do anything and get a free pass( just imagine any player doing that tantrums which dhoni  did in IPL when he was losing)

Everybody keep saying that he is so cool but it's rather contrary he basically just don't give a shit. Look at any other captain after losing important match you will find similarly but Dhoni's case you won't. 

It is basically every aspect of his career he do anything that doesn't look good on him people will turn it into a his skill ( i have literally seen video where some people dubbed his voice so it look like he isn't swearing at Manish Pandey ( i get it . people swear all the time and things get competitive in sports, but why sugar coat it to make him larger than life character)


He is great wicket keeper and has a good track record untill 2016. But i think power got in his head.

Sports,How Indians enjoy a national team game on Cricket World Cup?,"Hello Indian friends!

&amp;#x200B;

Im Brazilian, and always loved sports. I use to watch everything broadcasted on TV. But almost no one here knows nothing about cricket, I would say most part of Brazilian dont even know what cricket actually is, and just a few could understand the rules. Because of the current World Cup, for the first time I tried to understand how a cricket game goes on, and I really liked it. I think cricket is a funny game, and I liked the tension and strategy involving it.  Anyway, I dont imagined before that game's are so long, this is weird for Latin Americans, who basically follow just football. 

&amp;#x200B;

As India is famous to be one of the most passionate cricket countries, I started ask myself, how Indians enjoy a national team game on World Cup?

&amp;#x200B;

I mean, in Brazil, FIFA World Cup is a really massive moment. If national team plays on a morning or afternoon on our local time, almost all the schools and workplaces will not open on this period and basically everyone will be watching the game. Not everyone likes ""regular"" football, but almost everyone gets involved with football in World Cup. You can even hear people's reaction on the game from your window. By two hours, the whole country just stops to watch it, and I think this is normal on all other ""footballing"" nations.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I think stop a country by eight hours for a sports event is maybe not possible. I'm wrong? How the country lives a India game day on World Cup? Also, football fans use to watch almost every FIFA WC game, even the ones that Brazil doesnt play. How cricket fans live World Cup? And about people who are not regular cricket fans, how excited they get on World Cup?"
Sports,Your thoughts on e-sports,"I recently saw a video where the Danish PM visited the largest e-sports training arena and played Counter Strike Global Offensive (csgo) with their team.
E-sports has undeniably risen and still rising up to huge popularity levels

Yet , in India we see people suggesting that gaming is bad and games should be banned and it feels like our government has no idea that a huge platform like e-sports exists. 

Seeing that people wanted PUBG banned for not acknowledging their mistake or bad parenting also makes it look like majority of India is against e-sports.

What are your thoughts ?"

We are reviewing and previewing the current world cup matches and also reminiscing about the 90s when we as kids first started watching cricket.

Sports,Do people get socially / personally alienated because they're not interested / scared of pets?,"Over the past few months (and over the course of the last couple of years) I have noticed that an not having an overwhelming affection for dogs, cats and all assorted pets is a rather significant factor in maintaining relations with friends and family, dealbreakers when it comes to dating and possibly relations too. 

[ *""i'm a mother / father of 2 doggos""* ; *""if there's a doggo in your pic i'm dating you and stealing that good boi""* ; **the evergreen classic** *""doggos over humans any day...""* ; *""if my cat likes you, only then you have my approval...""* ; the deluge of appreciation tweets & posts on Instagram / Facebook; now the rise in posts in this very sub over the past week and many, many more...]

Dating apps have women and men displaying overwhelming affection for their pets. I've personally been unmatched and (digitally) broken contact with on a couple of occasions because I straight up admitted that i'm not too keen about pets (specifically dogs). 

[that i'm kinda scared of dogs in general due to a childhood mishap with a pet dog is a whole other issue altogether - growing up I've managed to control my fear/worry and while I don't exactly start screaming when in close proximity to a dog, I do look visibly panicked]

i'm not exaggerating when I say a potential marriage alliance was completely nipped in the bud because of the fact that she had a tattoo of her pet dog and I clearly admitted that i'm not a fan of having a pet / pets in the future. My entire existence as a human being and all my joys and sorrows, education, academics, work experience, sporting and personal achievements were instantly invalidated in a flash - because of this viewpoint.

while I clearly and obviously do not have an issue with folks having pets at their homes and the visible rise of pet friendly public spaces. cafes & restaurants - any attempts at trying to meet at non pet presence(d??) places is met with a lot of derision and straight up hostility. 

I understand that folks with pets treat them as nothing short of family members - but their decision to stay away from actual human beings; avoid and have a low opinion of those who are averse to pets - is rather confusing and if I may admit to it - a bit hurtful as well. I've missed out on a couple of social & personal relations because of this and I really do think it rankles.

Am I only one being overtly sensitive to this situation or is this an actual thing?"
Sports,Old Players I was remembering in this WC 19.,"In this world Cup, England become Champion first time ever since England is one who give birth to this game and they never won any World Cup Trophies. 

As every Indian Fan is sad about India get lose and Eliminated in Semi Final against New Zealand. 

But in this world cup I was Remembering some old players and imagining what If they were part of Current Team. 

##OLD MS DHONI. 

As everyone beloved Dhoni who maybe didn't bat at level fan expected but his contribution in planning making, experience and managing play big factor for India Qualify for Semi Final. 

But at some moments I was missing that Old 2011-14 Finisher Dhoni and 2000 Aggressive Dhoni and one of the moment was India match with England. When Dhoni come to Bat team needed Runs with run rate of almost 10 but surprisingly he leave First ball he faced. And even in Aadil Rashid over in which It was Expected that Dhoni will free his arms only get 5 runs in that Over. And he even stopped Pandya from hitting shorts who was making quick runs before Dhoni Come to play and they were not even trying to play any big shorts. 

That moment I was Imagining if It was Dhoni from 2011-14, even he plays some slow game but he definitely starts play big shorts in last 5-6 overs and match would be little closer. Or If It was 2000 Dhoni who is purely aggressive and hard hitter, combination of aggression of Pandya and 2000 Dhoni would definitely bring match close and possibly even ensure India Victory. 

##Rahul Dravid. 

Seriously we never got any alternate of ""Wall"" yet in current Team. We even got alternate of Sachin, we got better bowling attack, better Opening Pair, but we never got Alternate of Dravid. **When we need Opener, Dravid is there. we need finisher,  Dravid is there. We need any player who can stabilize innings, Dravid is there, when 4th day is in trouble, Dravid is there.** Complete package of Batsman was Dravid. 

In India Vs New Zealand Semi Final, India lost top 3 batsman just under score of 10 and 6 wickets just under score of 100. But Thanks to Jadeja and Dhoni who atleast prevent Shameful lose of India. 

But I was Imagining what If Dravid was playing this match. Seriously this guy is most Sensible, Reliable and trustable Batsman India ever got. If he was in this match then Dravid potentially could stabilize innings when Team was losing wickets and keep one side secure. 

Dravid is One I am missing most in Current Team India and It is sad to see we cannot replace him. ����������"

SAARC nations’ unity could have been such a big boon to advance and leverage the interests of the people of this region of the world. Instead, we remain a continuously bickering and mercurial bunch of neighbors. 

I am biased to India’s interests and our positions. I, however, do notice how EU has helped the nations like Poland to advance on various social, medical and economic indexes. Being like EU may be a distant dream, we sure can come together and push back on the Chinese when they dump our countries with cheap stuff, the Americans when they push defense deals and play active international politics in our region and EU when they target this region around visa policies.

China has 2 billion people and has made the most with them.They currently have track runners running 100m times in 9.8s which is enough to medal if not even win the next olympics even if Chinese are not “athletic” in a large sample size there will be elite athletes. So why haven’t they been found in India. China also wins the second most medals and have also produces players in basketball. I’m just curious why this is with the population size.

For example, before the last Cricket world cup, reddit cricket was awash with a few Footballers and athletes from different sports taking selfies with Indian shirts saying ""I support Team India"".

/Cricket was awash with fawning Indian fans. Granted, I know most will be young fans, but something didn't sit right with me. Its clear that these stars dont even know what cricket is, let alone there is a WC going on.... It was clearly just a PR Strategy. 
The similar thing was done by alot of companies when it comes to Bollywood.

I just found it soooooo patronizing and condescending. They know Indians would eat that shit straight out of their hands. The know quality doesnt mean anything but quantity goes along way. India has a very fad based culture. So consumerism of merchandise is easy $$$ for International companies.

I dont blame the companies, its basic marketing. I just wish Indians would be self aware and appreciate that these people dont give a shit about Indians except our wallets and want us eating out of their hands. We make ourselves look desperate and pathetic."

Sports,MS Dhoni is most overrated indian player of all time,"MS Dhoni got lucky with great indian teammates who won the worldcup. He wasn't best indian team captain but he was captain of best Indian team(at WC winning).He got great cult following who are blind to see anything that looks bad on him so because of that Media sings his great endeavour all Time because criticism him would be bad for business. This why he got so strong in board that he basically do whatever the fuck he likes (you can't ignore some of the team selection which are done after 2011, *Gambhir*). He basically IS team selector and nobody wants to say anything because he is too powerful. Everybody is on his side in board. His performance is shit in last  two years(i think he should have retired somewhere around 2017)but still he makes every single cut. His performance in world cup 2019 is shit but nobody speaking anything because he may retire after worldcup and why risk it all to make a point and become target of internet mob(kudos to Sachin for criticizing him) 

He is gotten to a point where will do anything and get a free pass( just imagine any player doing that tantrums which dhoni  did in IPL when he was losing)

Everybody keep saying that he is so cool but it's rather contrary he basically just don't give a shit. Look at any other captain after losing important match you will find similarly but Dhoni's case you won't. 

It is basically every aspect of his career he do anything that doesn't look good on him people will turn it into a his skill ( i have literally seen video where some people dubbed his voice so it look like he isn't swearing at Manish Pandey ( i get it . people swear all the time and things get competitive in sports, but why sugar coat it to make him larger than life character)


He is great wicket keeper and has a good track record untill 2016. But i think power got in his head.

Here's the mind-blowing overall medal tally:

- Gold : 85
- Silver : 154
- Bronze : 129

I had posted a just few days ago on how investing heavily in only a handful of ""profitable talents"" viz. dance, singing, comedy and cricket; and media's blatant neglect of other talents might discourage talented individuals from pursuing their interests in other fields of sports and art. 

And today I read about these champions of indomitable determination. They proved how, despite their hardships, special abilities and limited support, one can make history. One must also applaud their parents and well wishers for truly believing in their children when the world generally looks down upon people with special needs & abilities.

Most of these sports persons will soon return to their normal lives full of obstacles. I only hope that these men & women of passion get as much support and nurturing as possible from the govt as well as the society. They made India proud. They deserve to be rewarded and rewarded well for bringing glory to the nation. And more importantly for bringing a ray of hope in the lives of millions of others.

[Their homecoming pictures are the best thing I've seen today.](http://www.newindianexpress.com/galleries/sport/2019/mar/24/special-olympics-indias-medal-winners-return-home-amidst-glitzy-and-glory-102173.html)

These are the smiles that deserved extensive coverage in the media. They deserved interviews. Their stories deserved to be told. They have the potential to inspire and change lives. But, alas, hardly did we even realize that such an incredible feat was even accomplished in India.

His father threw away his gold medal in skating so that he wouldn't get distracted from cricket. He calls his childhood home a good quality jail. Despite a glorious career, there's a lot of hurt. I really resent this pushy style of parenting, forcing your dreams onto your children, and then saying 'we are doing it for your best only'."

Sports,Are there no centrists in India who are not completely polarised by political ideologies and are objective in assessing & supporting Govts based only on their administration?,"I am a centrist. An Indian who believes that Govts and political parties are not boyhood football, cricket and other sports teams that you have to be loyal to and support no matter what or oppose no matter what. 

I can praise a party for the right steps they took and criticise the same people for the wrong ones. 

Just like it happens in good corporate cultures. Based on merit & performance. 

No one or no party is bigger than the country and what it good for the future of it's people. Why can't we as citizens start getting more objective in our assessment? The best countries on Earth have the least amount of political polarisation as the people there only want progress. 

For eg. Not everything that a party XYZ has done is correct because you support them and not everything the same party did is wrong is because you loathe them. 

Currently I find it difficult to find like minded people who are objective in their outlook without having to identify themselves rigidly with being completely anti someone or completely pro someone. I feel we can never progress until we come out of this fanboyism. 

This is not an agenda I'm trying to propagate, but perhaps I can be enlightened by some insights on why this happens."

Sports,[General] What is your opinion about the IITs? Do you think they're worth it? What should be done to fix the obviously flawed institutions and their admission process?,"Some of you may have come across one of my previous posts in this subreddit which can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e5sqaz/im_jee_aspirant_is_there_any_chance_i_can_crack/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) if you're looking for the full story. Basic information is that I've been preparing for JEE Mains exam but some problems have hindered my preparation and plan.

While preparing I couldn't ignore how flawed these institutions are, there's barely any research done, barely any breakthroughs in science, lack of innovation and a lot of it can be attributed to how these institutions take in students, the admission process is biased towards upper middle class and the rich, those who can afford the ridiculously expensive coaching institutions, the coaching culture is a demon in its own way and deserves a thread on its own but I'll keep it as straight and simple as I can. The admission process involves how fast you can apply the memorized formula to a specific type of question, it doesn't require you to approach the question in an innovative way which would force you to think about it.

I could go on and on about how the system is flawed, how they should introduce western ways to take in students which both supports extra-curricular activities, overall creativity, communication and sports.

In conclusion, I don't think they're worth 3-4 years of life the students have to sacrifice in order to get these institutions, the pressure and lack of social interaction."

Sports,My assessment on Indian Olympics contingent,"I was very excited about India's chances at Rio Olympics but sadly we were very unlucky there. I was very heartbroken after last Olympics. Been following Indian Olympics sports very closely for last 4 years and I feel this time we can genuinely finish with 10 medals (if we get some luck in our favour). Here are my predictions :-

1) Shooting is very unpredictable sport but this time we have many fearless youngsters who are performing exceptionally well. We should win more than 3 medals at least if all goes well. Our best chances are in events like 10m Air Pistol (both men & women), 10m Air Rifle (both men & women) and Mixed Air Pistol & Mixed Air Rifle team event. You can check performance of our shooting team here https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_ISSF_World_Cup

2) Mirabai Chanu is most certain to win a medal for us at Tokyo. At recently concluded World Championship she finished at fourth place with Chinese occupying top 2 spots. But in weightlifting, a country can only send one athlete in Olympics so that means Mirabai will be 3rd at worst. She is currently 13 kg ahead from her nearest competitor https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_World_Weightlifting_Championships_%E2%80%93_Women%27s_49_kg

3) I think everyone here is aware about Sindhu's badminton exploits. So I won't explain too much. We can also win a surprise medal in men's singles.

4) In Wrestling, Vinesh Phogat & Bajrang Punia is most certain to win a medal for us. We can also win one or two medals from wrestling if we get a favourable draw. Check our wrestling performance from ongoing World Championship https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_World_Wrestling_Championships

5) Amit Panghal is a favourite to win a medal in boxing. He is current Asian Games & Asian Championship gold medalist. He has recently won a silver in World Championship. There were 3 other Indian boxer who were in QF at world championship. I'm slightly unsure about India's chances in women's boxing.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_AIBA_World_Boxing_Championships

Outside of these 5 sports, we have half-chances to win a medal in few other sports like Archery, Hockey, Golf and Tennis. I'm not expecting any medals from athletics. Only Niraj Chopra can finish inside top 5 in athletics event.

This is my own assessment. Please tell me if I'm missing some other medal contenders."

Sports,Top 5 Funny Cricket Moments��,
Sports,Lifecycle of Indian Male,"Day 1 – You are born. Parents are celebrating that you are male and even more happier if you have fair skin.

&#x200B;

Childhood – You are expected to go with the flow. You begin to learn the ins and outs of Indian society. Everything can be bargained for in the market and wild animals are everywhere. Creativity, loners, and independent thinking are frowned upon. If you get bullied, **IT’S YOUR FAULT FOR BEING DIFFERENT**. Anything bad that happens (poor eyesight, too short, too fat, etc.) is also **YOUR FAULT**.

&#x200B;

More Childhood – Your parents educate you on your background/culture and how it is the best in the world. In public, your family act friendly with everyone but in private they may make comments ranging from politically incorrect jokes to straight up racist statements. But it’s okay **BECAUSE YOU’RE SPECIFIC CULTURE IS THE BEST**.

&#x200B;

Teenage – The only thing that matters are grades at this point. Sports? Not for you. Music? Weak hobby. Art? That’s for transgenders. Comparisons begin with sharma ji’s beta. Pretty soon, you realize school is not about learning but regurgitating information in a short amount of time. Many people get good grades but few have any curiosity and even fewer learn good civic sense. Teachers are abusive but it’s **YOUR FAULT** because **ELDERS CAN NEVER BE WRONG**.

&#x200B;

More Teenage – You somehow get into college. Only options are medicine or engineering, otherwise you are out of the family because no one will marry you. You also realize that your parents don’t really love each other and try to emotionally blackmail you because you are the only reason they are together. Girls are to be avoided because they only want sex and are a distraction. Everyone (friends, families, distant relatives, neighbors) is in your business because **NOTHING IS PRIVATE**. You are responsible for family honor.

&#x200B;

Studenthood – You go to college. You meet many indoctrinated kids but join the crowd because who are you. You (or at least me) grew up with few female interactions and fail miserably at getting a girlfriend because you are too shy. By the time you get your act together, you are 22. At least you made some good mates.

&#x200B;

Adulthood – You become an Engineer or Doctor **BECAUSE EVERYONE DOES IT**. You probably get a job. A high paying job. It doesn’t matter how much you work, what you do, or if you enjoy it because only **MONEY MATTERS**. If you don’t get a job, it is your fault because you weren’t competitive in the rat race.

&#x200B;

Now you are expected to marry a women significantly younger than you, from a (very) similar background, is fair, very educated but also a housewife. **TROPHY WIFE**. You will be expected to live with your parents who will control your adult life just like their parents did to them. Your new goal is to get to America/Canada/UK **BECAUSE INDIANS BRING THE BEST CULTURE**. Even if you don’t make it, anyone who you know does is automatically a good friend that lives abroad.

&#x200B;

Regardless of where you are in life, you might get a son and the process repeats."

He used it for typing, there was something FoxPro thing I don't exactly remember he used to do. Then most of my 2000s went playing with friends, games, school, etc. It was real fun, to be honest. I cherish those memories, a lot. College was not so good, but okay kinda. I realized a hell lot in college, not the studies haha but a lot about me. I'm not on Facebook and Instagram, quit them already. In the past year, I've developed a rigorous thinking about work and how not to throw away your life. It's really turning good for me. I follow Angel co-founder Naval and like him a lot. He's a good man. All in all, I have my interests or niche that I follow. It's good to not be mainstream sometimes. I don't have a goal. The only thing I know is to work hard, improve my skills and learn continuously. I joke at people who settle down and say learning stops when you get old. I call bullshit. 

But I don't know how should I feel? Being in a country with people who are deprived of such things. Should I feel guilty or thankful? I would think, if I was born in a poor family, I would've been living a mediocre life, with struggling to survive. I think when I reach 30, I will be financially independent. Only dependencies I want are my parents and sibling. No external sources like marriage or some other shit.  They raised me right, now it will be my turn to be with them at old age. 

Thanks for reading."

Sports,Today’s Pradesh Today Newspaper....I only wished they had bats in place of weapons��,
Sports,Indian mentality.,"This is something that I wanted to get off my chest. India got its independence in 1947 but even now indirectly we are under the rule of westerners.

Let me start with education

Our curriculum is such that , innovation and creativity is killed, we are trained and educated in such a way that we can work under the huge MNC's operated by westerners. Individuality is killed and people are corrupted by the sheep mentality. Higher education is a big joke in this country, those who pursue masters and post docs are those who couldn't land a job(most cases). We still have the slave mindset within us , we want to work for someone, doesn't matter if you like the job but we will work to get paid.The syllabus was designed by the british and we are still following it.

Moving on, we have our economy,

India and Pakistan are the cheapest countries to live in this world, not africa,not venezuela but India. What this essentially means is that if you go to any other country with the same wealth you possess in India, you will become [poorer .](https://poorer.No)  No wonder Americans use Indians for cheap labour. Even after being the cheapest country to live in , we have so many living below poverty line which speaks a lot about wealth distribution in our country. All those who come up with stats regarding GDP, please lookup GDP per person because that's what essentially matters.

We call ourselves a secular country, but ram mandir dispute constantly made headlines. Let me be honest, I dont care about who wins regarding this, but was this really a priority, can't this wait until we have progressed in other important areas?, our healthcare is in such bad condition, the state of the BPL people are pathetic but they want to construct this temple now anyways? Im not asking them to build hospitals in the place instead of the temple, that's foolishness and makes no sense, why can't they spend on healthcare and education first and afterwards think about this temple.

The defense budget is 3.18 lakh crore ,great our army is powerful and is the second largest but what the government fails to realize is that the biggest war is happening inside India. We spend so much preparing for war with other countries that we fail to fight our internal problems. Why can't the budget for healthcare and education be increased by reducing the budget for defense. Now some might argue that countries like USA too spend large o defense but the difference is that they are already developed, they don't have much problems from within whereas we are still a third world country.

All those media hype surrounding how India is a rising superpower is complete bogus, they want us to believe we are making progress so that can make good use of our pathetic situation. The real rising superpower is china, just look at their technological advancements.  

Moving on, we have sports 

The most popular sport in India is cricket. Now let me remind you that cricket was introduced by the british to us and we still play the game widely while they have moved on other sports. cricket is the number one sport only in 2 countries , India and pakistan both which were ruled by british. We are indirectly still slaves, we play the same sport they gave us even after 100 years. 

Having a population of about 1.4billion, our representation in olympics wont even equal countries which have population less than 10 million. Thats how pathetic is the condition of sports in India.

People just dont care, dont watch and don't play other sports, we simply aren't told to do so and so we refrain from playing others, only if this mentality changes will we progress in other sports, we can't just blame the government for not funding, if people aren't watching how will they fund. 

Moving on, we have women safety

Women safety is a big joke in India, Indian culture teaches us to respect women but why is the situation so pathetic.

Clearly this is because of lack of education and lack of sex education.

We wrote kamasutra, but now talking about sex is taboo. Indian schools treat sex as a foreign topic and most schools just outright skips this topic. When you say sex is taboo, it increases the curiosity in the mind of people, people crave most what they don't get/understand and like adding oil to fire we have all bollywood movies objectifying women which corrupts the weak minded and thus they give in to their sexual feelings.  

Sex education is important to understand and control one's feelings. 

I created a Fake facebook id, with a woman's picture as the profile picture and I got 879 friend requests within a day, most of them being indians, and I got 100 pm's asking me for nude pics. This level of desperation will ultimately lead to them becoming rapists and [molesters. No](https://molesters.No)   wonder women dislike Indian men.

And finally I want to end with bollywood

Most of the actors are light skinned and have features similar to europeans.Almost half of the actresses are NRI who eith er lived in england or USA.

This clearly shows that we still subconsciously are being slaves, we consider light skinned more superior, we feel they deserve more respect and this mentality should be changed if we really want progress in our society."

So I have done my MBA from a relatively newer IIM (17-19 Batch) with majors in finance and marketing I got placed in leading bank as a relationship manager which was the third company on campus.I always wanted either a marketing or consultant profile but our placement committee had informed us that not many good consulting or marketing firms would visit the campus and hence we should not miss out on any opportunity and hence i did not take any chance and got placed. However after i got placed several good companies both in marketing and consulting did visit our campus,but due to the one person one job policy of the college i could not sit in any of them. Now i am stuck with a sales profile which neither has good package or a great location.Its not that I hate sales but it's just that I don't want to be stuck in sales profile for life which I would be at my current job.So i am thinking of quitting the job and am actively applying for both consultant and marketing roles however it is difficult getting shortlisted as i am a fresher and on top of that most companies do not prefer some one who has left his job early to join them as i got to know in the interview( one of the few place where i got shortlisted) which i gave.I would be highly grateful if you folks here can provide some guidance for me."

Non-Political,"[Text] [Non Political] I was on verge of quitting my business after four years, I wrote this to myself.","Waldo Emerson once said that bad times have scientific values, and I can’t recall who quoted that no matter how bad it is, it can always be worse. These are some uninspiring thoughts when we have poured in years of work to learn, unlearn, build, dismantle, and assemble again. 

Some jumping ship, some hanging around fighting for the cause; begging, borrowing, appropriating, somehow, you do everything to never let doubts creep into your mind. 

Some nights are spent, staring at a blank screen, unresponsive code, a sad prototype of the dream that you chase.

Some days are spent, evaluating yourself, if the sum total of your life was a failure that was staring you in the face each day, each night. Your self-worth becomes zero, you become completely undesirable to people who probably loved you once, you have already jerked off to all the porn that you could handle.

By this time, all your friends have become your creditors, with lines of credits exhausted, you scroll your contact list constantly to find that one person, not to seek funds, but to talk with.
We try to hark back for simpler times, reminiscence the moments that made us laugh, then, but we hope probably it would bring an honest smile to our face – our smiles that we had pawned off we did not know when, to users, downloads, sessions and GMVs.

Then one day, you come home, stare at the blank screen, try to make sense of things, break down, and just before letting go of everything seems like an option. You think of Ali, you think of Lincoln, you seek wisdom in the hymns of Nanak, and sagacity and enlightenment from Bhagvad Gita; but you know who comes to your rescue, Earnest Hemingway.

*You are not made for defeat, you can be destroyed, but not defeated.*

To further (mis)quote Hemingway, sometimes our actions are not immediately discernible and when we try for something beyond attainment, something that has never been done, and things that others have tried and failed, and perhaps with ‘karma’ you will succeed.

I guess Andy Dufresne was right, it does come down to a simple choice really. Get busy living or get busy dying."
Non-Political,I’m fed up with the aviation industry in India.,"Up until the start of this year I used to fly only on Jet, unless circumstances dictated otherwise. 
I rarely travelled on Indigo, Spice or GoAir. 
Fuck man I miss jet and more importantly I’m pissed at this shithole of an industry. The low cost model has almost conclusively destroyed the scope for any other form of air travel. There is Vistara but it hardly services the destinations that indigo and spice do, and not as frequently either. 
I flew on spice yesterday and it’s safe to say that it ranks high on my worst air travel experiences, and this includes having to sit at Mumbai airport because my KF flight was delayed twice due to technical difficulties. 
The seats were stiff is wood, and there was near zero space for legroom and a really shitty seat pitch. Cabin crew? Cold and unfriendly. 
Don’t even mention boarding. Whenever I fly from Chennai, check in at the indigo counter feels like I’m trying to board an unreserved compartment in a railway. Too many people too less counters, and an “only baggage drop” sign that’s basically a giant public fuck you to anybody who did a web check in. Indigo consistently ranks as the worst flying experience in India you could opt for. 
All I ask for is an airline that has a good legroom, a comfortable seat and decent food. Not to mention a boarding process that is hassle free. Why is it the we can’t have a decently premium airline like in Europe, America or even Asia? They all have low cost options(Ryan, Air Asia etc) but they all have premium airlines as well(Delta, KLM, Singapore etc). India has fuck all. I feel that due to the large middle class it caters to, the aviation industry has generalised and ended up eliminating the needs of a considerable class of flyers that have a sizeable disposable income. 
Then there’s also “why should I pay more when coach lands at the same time as first, aka my dad” like just fuck that attitude sometimes. People who travel for business and take same day/ two day flights would benefit from comfort so much. We shouldn’t have to be treated as degenerate travellers just cause we wanted to save a bit."

GGSIPU pays Rs. 25 per answer book ....in one bundle there are 30 answer books so it makes Rs750/-  for evaluating one bundle....GGSIPU norms say that a evaluator must take 3 hours to evaluate one bundle....so in a day a evaluator can evaluate a maximum of two bundles.....which makes a total earning of Rs.1500/- per day + a conveance of Rs.600/- per day making the total amount = Rs. 2100/-.
> Now what actually happens is in the university there are two evaluation centres one for first and third year and the other for second and final year.....now actually what happens is....an evaluator reaches centre A at 9:30 am and get a bundle issued which he/she checks in one hour but do not deposit it as the university employees will not take it back before three hours...so they leave that bundle there and rush too the B centre and get another bundle issued there at 11:00  they check it by 12:00 now they rush back to centre A to return their previous bundle and get a new bundle issued there....the same process is repeated and an evaluator ends up in checking two bundles each at both evaluation centres thus earning Rs. 4200/- a day instead of Rs. 2100/-  a day..
> now just imagine the answer book u wrote in 3 hours is evaluated in less then 2 minutes.....coz the evaluator has to right the marks on front sheet and do the total and also fill an additional evaluation sheet with marks....and all this he does in a maximum of 1 and a half hour for 30 answer books. This is done by around 20 % evaluators who comes for evaluation.
> 
> 2. To be an evaluator the university ask every evaluator to fill a form which contains a maximum of four subject that the evaluator has taught in the current semester.....this form need to be signed by the hod and the head of the institution also......now the beauty is very few teachers teaches more then two subject in college but in these forms most of the evaluators fill four subjects....now imagine four subject for centre A and four subject for centre B which mean they know 8 subjects and thus makes them elligible to check copies of 8 different subjects...coz if one subject answer books are over then they can get the next subject issued....
> 
> 3. Approx. 80 % of the evaluators do not prepare a solution nor do they know the solution.....they are just giving average marks.....that is the reason why the students writing anything get marks and often pass the exams.
> 
> 4. Most of the senior and sincere teachers do not go for evaluation....the people doing evaluation are primarily those who are on consolidated salary getting anything between Rs.20,000/ to Rs. 30,000/- as salary from there parent college....so they find it as an opportunity to earn some extra money.....just imagine that there are evaluators who earn around Rs. 50,000/ or even more during evaluation......this should explain most of the reasons....
> 
> 5. The fact is very few evaluators actually evaluate the answer books....90% of evaluation is done with just the monitary benefits associated with it....so until the university takes some serious counter measures .....this will continue to happen.....

 So this Janmashtami I saw this heart-warming scene.

A small dahi-handi was being broken by a mixed group of young boys and girls.

The girls didn't have to worry that the guys will be continuously looking for a chance to grope them.

They didn't have to worry that just because they are ok with guys touching them to help them climb and stay in place they are going to be judged as being ""open to be touched"".

They didn't have to worry that just because their tops might be a bit out of place every now and then, they are going to be slut-shamed and be judged as ""available"".

And since it was such a healthy atmosphere the girls were wholeheartedly participating and enjoying themselves as equals.

Definitely at least some green shoots of society maturing and there being real, healthy, open and equal interaction between the sexes leading to mutual fun and happiness."

Is this the reality of India? Do people with degrees actually succeed? Even if yes why the people discourage others who are interested?

Non-Political,Planning to buy a second hand scooter on OLX when I noticed something strange. Need advice.,"Hey,

So I've been studying in Bangalore, and have been looking around to buy a scooter for myself, for daily commute. The cheapest option for me, and one which I kind of had a liking towards, was the Honda Navi. Since I need it only for the next 3 years, I was looking at second hand options.

All the listings I had seen earlier were already sold.

Yesterday I came across a listing for a Navi on OLX, mentioning single ownership etc. I contacted the seller, and discussed about the scooter a bit, and spoke about the price, and told him that I will get in touch with him and test the scooter when I'm back in Bangalore in a couple of days.

I quickly ran the numberplate on the RTO Parivahan website just to check all things, and it came back to a different name from the seller. But this name was familiar.

This name, I had seen earlier while running some registration numbers of the earlier listings I had seen. So I quickly went through the listing I had seen on Quikr, and it had the same Registration, and same physical numberplate.
But, the seat cover was changed, and the headlight caps were changed to orange.

The Quikr listing was posted 8 days ago, while the OLX listing was posted 7 days ago.
Quikr listing said 10,700km while OLX said 10,900km.

I asked the seller once again if it was single owned, and he confirmed.

I need some advice as to what this could be. This is the first time I'm dealing with purchasing any sort of vehicle on my own, so I just want to be sure.

If you want to take a look at the listings, I will send them to you via PM."

I asked the station master at Marine Lines that where can I get the ticket and he pointed me to other end of the station for which you have to go through the platform or cross a very shady road risking your life at night (same with other stations).

Upon raising the safety concern, he, along with another staff member, tried to attack me physically. I was lucky that a train just halted at station and I ran to board it risking my life further.

I tweeted to IRCTC and all they did was tag one account after another and nothing ever happened.

Do not ask me to use AVTM or UTS to book the ticket online. What about those who do not use tech as easily as we all do? Are they allowed to travel ticketless?

The recent Badlapur incident where a train was stuck in floods and passengers had to be airlifted. IS the system so incompetent that they cannot see the rising water to stop the train before situation goes out of control? It was not a flash flood which caused the issue.

I might be completely wrong here and missing some critical thought process behind shutting shops and not planning the train signals. So any argument is welcomed but the way Indian Railways is evolving is making me wonder what is our future.

Non-Political,"Hinduism, conversion and the neutrality of the Indian Secular State: a non-political, theological exploration","tl;dr:

* Pagan traditions and Semitic religions are fundamentally different manifestations of religiosity. 

*  Traditions are difficult to proselytize because they do not consider other traditions as false. 

* Semitic religions believe that some religions are indeed false and so encourage and facilitate conversion. 

* The Indian state sees Hinduism as just another semitic religion. 

* The Indian state by allowing conversion is working within a Christian theological framework. It is not being neutral.  



Full length:

In India, we have two different kinds of religions: Pagan or Dharmic or Indic traditions (Hindu, Jain and Buddhist traditions) and Semitic or Abrahamic religions (Islam and Christianity). 

Hindu traditions exist because they are passed down from one generation to the other. Such traditions do not actively seek converts because they do not entertain the notion that other people follow false gods or have false religions. 

Such traditions see things like devas or puja pr bhakti as familial or traditional practices. They are followed in order to maintain some continuity between different generations, not because they contain some grand and timeless truth. The practioners of such traditions might try to justify their actions (a Durga bhakt would say that she is worshiped because she killed a powerful demon).  Such justifications are mostly offered to outsiders (non-bhakts or non-hindus) and are not theologically consistent. 

Observing ancestral practices need not be justified logically just as there is nothing logical about writing a sonnet using just 14 lines. Why 14? Its just tradition. There is nothing scientific or logical about it. 

 Semitic religions (namely Islam and Christianity) spread partly as ancestral practices and partly through conversion.

 Islamic and Christian theologians try (not always successfully of course) to be logically consistent because they  think that they are after some grand and timeless truth. Using the God-given faculty of Reason, they want to understand the nature of Creation and the Creator. Conversion makes sense to Muslims and Christians because they think there are false religions and false gods. And the people who worship such false gods will be punished after they die by the True God. To save the “heathen”, Muslims and Christians are encouraged to engage in proselytization and conversion. 

The heathen needs to be saved from his own spiritual blindness.
 

Indian secularism is defined as equal respect and equidistance from all religions. The secular state sees Hinduism as just another Semitic religion with an internally consistent theology containing a singular grand Truth. So a Brahmin is just another kind of Priest, and Gita another kind of “religious” text like the Quran. Having confused tradition with religion, the Indian state allows for proselytization thinking that it is possible to convert people from one tradition to the other. 


By allowing proselytization and conversion, the Indian state has accepted that:

1.	There are some True gods and some False  gods.
2.	It is possible and necessary and understandable that people can be “saved” from eternal damnation for worshiping false gods. 
3.	Hindu traditions can compete financially and theologically in the “marketplace of damned souls” on a level footing with Islam and Christianity.
  
None of the above statements holds up to  **neutral scientific scrutiny** . Do humans have souls? Can souls be damned? Are there True and False gods? Do Islam and Christianity contain some timeless truth? 

Within the framework of Hindu “theology”, the notions that there are false gods and that you can be punished for worshiping such goads do not make sense.

However, all of the above statements make sense within the framework of Christian theology. 

Faced with two completely contradictory theoretical positions (there are some false gods and there are no false gods), the Indian state cannot be neutral. It either allows conversion (as it has done for the past 60yrs) and accepts the semitic notion of false gods, heathens etc or it bans conversion and gives undue advantage to pagan traditions. 

Faced with two very different kinds of religions, the Indian state cannot afford to be equidistant or show equal respect.

When she told me about the incident, I felt so bad that I don't even have a word to describe it. That situation badly affected her mental health and she questioned me what could she have done to stop what happened with her? What if it happens again? And even, should women carry guns?(she is not a violent person, it was just her angst and fear talking) 

I googled about this groping in public thing and turns out that it is very common in India, and some other countries too! But my google searches did not yield me any helpful information about this social issue that almost every woman in our country faces. So I'm here to ask those questions.

1. How can a woman prevent and defend this? What precautions should she take? 

2. What should she do right away as well as after this happens? 

3. Best self defence methods in these situations? (Like pepper spray)

4. Any group or commission that help in such cases? 

5. How does our police act on cases like this?

Living in India, you'll be given options to pursue a degree in Architecture, Engineering, Medical and other IT/CS or management courses after completion of your Jr. College.
People are so unaware of other amazing courses you can take up.

I've just completed a 3 year course of B.Sc. in Information Technology and during this course I've developed an interest in Design (Graphics, Information, Communication, etc).

Now while I'm looking for a Master's degree in Product/Information Design, I see so many Bachelor's degrees in Design that I could've taken up after Jr. College.

I don't regret these three years but I feel foolish for being unaware about such important things in life. I wish I could've known earlier.

Also very disappointed at how people in India emphasize Engineering, Architecture or other technical courses.

I've got no hate for any of the courses offered..I just wished the people of this country especially the youth would be aware of the various courses that can be taken up.
There's a course for all interests."

But, for e.g. my dad gave my religion as Hindu when the Census dude came, in many other cases the census taker records religion based on the name or community rather than actually asking each person their beliefs.

In 2006 World Values Survey - 6.6% Indians said they had no religion.

In the 2012 WIN-Gallup 13% were not religious, 3% were convinced atheists and 3% were unsure or did not respond.

Historically India has had the richest body of atheistic philosophy in the ancient world - Carvaka, Sāṃkhya, Buddhism and sophisticated god-free philosophies. Our national heros like Nehru and Bhagat Singh were atheists.

Overall we are underestimating irreligion in India due to bad census taking. Discuss."

They are all aware of the fake news issues but still exercise no caution.","With my parents I used to explain it to them, but they would never take heed. I finally got them to stop and exercise caution by openly embarrassing them in group chats by disproving their stories. But I can't do this with my relatives (my parents are laid back).

It honestly seems like most of the information that gets passed around in India is either fake or selective, only reading the stories that match your outlook. 

One instance that angered me a lot was when my uncle shared a video of Muslims in Karnataka rioting against dalits. I noticed all the signboard in this video were in Bengali, I looked it up and found it was a video of a riot in Bangladesh from 10 years back. I told this to him, and told him there was no Muslim rioting in Karnataka. He responded even if it's fake the ""meaning"" is real. wtf is that supposed to mean?

In speaking to a Muslim co worker she informed she gets similar fake news only in reverse. Photos of Palestine and Iraq getting passed over as Kashmir or Uttar Pradesh.

Fake news is making communities live in their own separate fictional realities. And these days people spent more time online then they do speaking to those in their neighborhood. Our reality is warped.

And that's just for politics. Forget the ridiculous claims that cancer can be treated by drinking fruit juice and that Buddha gives advice on how to make lots of money.

Honestly after some thinking I think the root of fake news is confirmation bias. People want to share and believe news that confirms how they already feel. Since most Indians have this false belief that ""natural"" = good they automatically believe claims that fruit juice cures cancer and vaccines cause autism. Only way to fight it is to challenge the belief that natural is not good by default. Same with my dumbass uncle, who thinks Muslims are troublemakers and thus will share any such news even if he knows it's fake."

It may not arrive in brand new condition.","I ordered a lot of books (manga and full scifi/fantasy novels) (about Rs. 20k order value) from Amazon recently. I have only received the first part of the order today.

I received Gene Mapper (Fujii Taiyo) and RG Veda Omnibus vols 1, 2 &amp; 3 (CLAMP) today. The books arrived in a less than stellar condition, to the extent that they might even be second hand or poorly stored! My copies of Cardcaptor Sakura's omnibus editions which I bought circa 2013 are in much better shape!

All of them have completely worn out covers, with smudge, grime and scuff marks all over. Bits of the cover print have also worn off. The page edges also appear to have ageing stains. The thick books were packed in a shoddy manner so the corners are bent.

Amazon customer service can only offer full returns, and won't give partial refunds. That leaves me with a major problem. I don't know where else to get these books at a competitive price. Sapnaonline is more expensive by Rs. 1000 for volume 2, and Flipkart is Rs. 600 more expensive for each volume.

The Amazon sellers were uRead and Amazing-Buy. I suspect they're actually the same seller since their prices are always identical, both have practically the same inventory in stock, and their parts of the order were processed together."

Non-Political,My wonderful journey with BSNL is coming to an end and it's entirely on them.,"If you remember I shared [my experience of getting a BSNL broadband.]( https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/58lwlk/heres_my_experience_of_getting_a_new_bsnl_bb_ll/), it's going ti be 3 years in next few months.

The connection and service was really beyond my expectations. I hardly had any problems and if there was any after lodging a complaint exchange used to call within 1 hour and lineman was at my door within minutes. I also used to get unlimited 10Mbps downloads, unlimited calling on my plan of ₹499+tax from last year when they revised the plans. 

But recently the connection quality degraded, there was frequent disconnection and to BSNL's credit they came and changed cable, did something at the junction box multiple times. But nothing could fix the disconnection problem. I even went to exchange to test my modem and it was fine, no disconnection there. 

Few weeks ago (about one month I think) they came and did something again which fixed the disconnection problem to some extent but there was still disconnection. What was worrying is my connection speed dropped to 2Mbps and below. Guy said it's a server problem and will be fixed, if not fixed then they will come again. 

I know it wasn't a server problem and told the guy multiple times to check. He did nothing and left. 

After that I called exchange multiple times, lodged complaints but all were closed saying fault is fixed. The linemans didn't come either. The exchange used to call and ask if broadband working or not, then after listening my problem he used to cut the call and after few hours I used to ger sms that fault is fixed .

After repeated calls to exchange, lodging complaints from last week the exchange told that the linemans aren't coming to work because they aren't getting salary from six months, they will send someone whenever they come. I waited for few days and called again and again, same story.

Now today they came and was working at the junction box, to my surprise they left without visiting my home. I called exchange to know what's going on and he said they can't fix it, and it won't go up from 2Mbps I'm getting. He told me to talk with officer. 

I said there was something that guys done and probably an easy fix if they reverse what was done earlier. The exchange giy didn't listen to me and hung up on my face! 

That's it BSNL, I don't have enough time and the mental power to take it up with grievance officer. I have suffered enough in last few months and wasted my time. I absolutely loved my time with BSNL, it's the only stable broadband that was available in my area. I don't have Hathway, Act or anything. I even requested them to give fiber line and 1 month earlier seeing my problem they told me that they'll give fiber but even after 1 month nothing progressed. 

Even customer care is clueless lately.

Goodbye my BSNL connection, you will be missed but not that much considering what I had to face at the end. I won't be taking your Fiber connection either.

This entire post is coming  from a guy who was really proud of taking BSNL connection in this era, alas BSNL, you failed me."

Non-Political,Jio blocking Reddit in Assam,"It's not just Reddit, certain sites (not porn sites, I assure you) are showing connectivity issues. Even if they connect, the speeds are too slow to even load a page within 2 mins making browsing a nightmare. Connection to VPN services are failing. Certain videos in YouTube suddenly stop playing leading to an endless buffer. It seems like the caching of YouTube in my local servers is being interrupted midway.

Sometimes these issues suddenly subside for about an hour and again come back. But the trend of these outages seems to be intentional rather than a network fault.

Is this a DNS thing? I don't think so. I've been using Google DNS since forever and I've just checked.

Everything else is just massively interruptive. Connecting sometimes and some other times, not. But the Reddit block is constant and absolute.

&amp;#x200B;

**Edit:** VPN is working now on optimal speeds. Still can't access Reddit without VPN.

**Edit 2:** YouTube is also working perfectly now. What is happening? I just made this post and everything seems to be going back to normal. Now, just Reddit is left to be unblocked and I'll have no complaints.

**Edit 3:** Reddit is back up again, though connecting to any server takes a while including all popular sites (except Google, since it is connected forever, I think)."

Basically I passed last year from ISC(CLASS 12 EXAM) boards with a stupid 83%. I tried though. I tried. No one believes it and eventually I think I don't even. I could have pushed myself more from 16 to 18 hrs but hell I couldn't. Yeah quality&gt;quantity but am just a below average student who needed quantity with quality and still failed. 

Now the entrance exams and somehow I managed to **** that too. I gave only JEE MAINS and I wasn't fully aware of it so it didn't felt that bad and damn me, I decided to take a drop. 

Started from June, left everything from football to watching it and social media too. I sacrificed, okay. It's not I didn't. Joined coaching. The faculty was not that good, I am not blaming, I understand they have to cover 2 years syllabus in 1 year. So from December I started to do it myself and somehow fate decided to give me tinnitus, ah that damn sound. I regret listening study material with headphone. I couldn't study for 1 month. That one month I was depressed like hell and doctor prescribed me an anti depressants and atleast I could sleep peacefully after eating that. So I shit my chances this year too..

Wbjee went awful but I tried... I tried..... I did... Do anyone believe all this shit? someone has to.. it's driving me insane.. my parents don't.. my friends doesn't.. It all sounds like am making excuses I don't even blame them... It was all my fault... Dammit.. it's insane... 

I gave COMEDK, I got 17000k rank, is it good? I know this is shit too.. but do I have any chances of salvaging myself? Please... Do tell..

She went to a wedding in another city got drunk and did not show up for work for a day. She keeps coming in late. She complains constantly. She talks and distracts me while working. She saves multiple copies of files and I have to sort through them to find the final file. 


But the worst fuck up was yesterday.


She makes spelling errors that I simply never expect. I can understand if you misspel a word or two but she literally gave the client company an entirely different name. I didn't catch it because I never expected it and it went to the client and got printed in their fucking media. Now my boss is breathing down my back and is screaming murder. Pretty sure I might get fired. I fucked up too for not being more thorough and checking her work but who the fuck makes a mistake with their own fucking client name? I look for grammatical errors and spelling errors not a fucking mistake with the fucking logo. Oh well. This job was fun while it lasted I guess."

Non-Political,Anatomy Of An Accident: How 29 Lives Were Lost Because Of Sleep Deprivation,"A bus fell down 40 feet from Yamuna Expressway in to a nala taking the lives of 29 people and injuring 27 others.

The bus was being driven at a speed of 120 km/hr. There is supposed to be a speed governor in state run buses. In this one there wasn’t.

The bus driver was driving his first big route. He didn’t know the route well enough and thus, he detoured twice causing delay. He was driving fast to make up for that lost time. Generally, there is supposed to be a team of two drivers for such journeys. Here there wasn’t. Only one driver driving alone. Add to it, he was tired and sleepy. He had been driving all night.

The passengers report telling him to stop and wash his face with water. He did so only 20 minutes before the accident. He continued thereafter and the next time he dozed, they all fell.

It’s not all grim a story. A villager called Nihal witnessed the accident, jumped into the drain, broke open the glass windows and rescued two to three passengers. He was the one to call the police as well as alert fellow villagers to help come rescue. Nihal is a hero.

However, this wasn’t just a freak accident. There were no two vehicles bumping into each other because of a technical snag. There were no animals suddenly crossing the Expressway. There was simply a driver tired and sleepy from driving the whole of the night. One who didn’t quite know the route and one who was speeding to reach in time. And despite specific guidelines particularly designed to avoid such accidents, a non-following of the same leading to the deaths of many.

The government has announced a compensation of Rs. 5 lakhs each to the family of the deceased and Rs. 2.5 lakhs to those injured. An investigation committee has been set up. Officials will be now be involved to figure out what seems to be staring us right in the face.

Road travel is dangerous. It is made more so by overworked sleep deprived drivers who could really use a partner driver or perhaps a nap.

And the thing is I travel a lot by bus and I would like to not think about it much but I do. For the system by design wants me to completely put my life in the hands of another. Accidents can happen but the least one expects is to not die because someone didn't get proper sleep.

Her parents cut her name off her college because they thought she was getting too independent. Can anyone advise me on what she should do now please?She was in a college in DU, just in case."
Non-Political,Need help. Friend into drug abuse and possibly feeling suicidal.,"A college friend of mine (let's call him X) has been working in Pune for a while now. A happy go lucky kind of guy. Loves smoking up, and always jolly.

He calls me off and on when he's high on weed and we talk about random shit.


Recently the way he's been talking has me concerned, the choice of words he's been using isn't really assuring at all. It has started worrying me. 


A mutual friend called me today and asked me about X. He asked if X sounded a bit off and then I told him what he's been talking about these days. This has the both of us very worried now. 


We had a senior who committed suicide and the things that he used talk about is kinda similar to what X talks about too.


So, later in the evening I called X just to talk about random things and I slowly eased into the current scene he's into. He's usually pretty open about the things he does. But today was different, he was just not opening up. It was very very difficult to talk to him.

He kept on talking about frequency, colors, music and a particular ""game"". He kept on telling that we're players and we need to beat this game. He was trying to relate everything to everything. He was just trying to link everything. 


I asked him if he did any hard drugs and then he told me that he did lines of cocaine earlier this month. He was busted and he spent a night in the jail too. He started telling me that it's still in his system and it ""just isn't going out"". I asked him if he did it recently again and he refused.


Even when the mutual friend called me, he told about what X spoke and the ""game"" thing was pretty common. My friend asked X to speak clearly and he was talking nonsense again. X even said ""If I go somewhere tomorrow, or if something happens to me, you'll be able to complete my story"".

Another disturbing thing that X told the mutual friend was he saw our senior (the one that committed suicide) in his dreams and he knows why he did it.


As of now X is on a 2 month notice period, and he told me that the people at his company know about his ""addiction"". Hearing this word, I asked him what he was addicted to and he started telling me that he can't tell it over the phone, he said he was afraid that someone would hear him. He said he'd want to meet us personally and talk about this substance addiction. 

I asked X about the other things he's been doing and he told me that everything has increased, from smoking cigs(every 30 mins) to his daily joints.


We talked a bit more and X knows that things are going downhill for him and he claims he's ready to receive help, he even mentioned rehab clinics. He was even paranoid about people at home plotting things against him. He said he was feeling lonely and he wanted a change of location and a fresh start. 


For now, I told X to call me whenever he feels like it, the mutual friend told him the same thing too. We know he's not himself and he's gone down a very dark path. We don't want it spiralling out of control. What can i do? What is the best possible way to approach this?"

&amp;#x200B;

I went to my family tout (yes, guilty here!) thinking it would be

1. done seamlessly
2. cost me 3x at best

&amp;#x200B;

But what I was not aware of is that despite paying 6x of what it would have cost me had I gone through the legit route, I got zero convenience. I was made to visit the office THRICE! The guy behind the counter was meaning to make more trouble for me by saying the only passport would be admissible as address proof, but then I relented and forced him to either accept my Voter ID for address proof OR state to me in writing with his name that the ID is not acceptable. He then realized it is not his day to mess with me further and let it go.

The tout as well was incompetent - didn't know of most intricacies or was unwilling to make it any easier for us. And his service charge itself was 1.5k. I had to take 2 half days from work and visit the place THRICE, because sometimes either some new affidavit has to be made or even better, Digital India's server connectivity got lost! #FML!

So, what should have cost me 500 rupees at best, cost me over 3k. And took me a span of 2 days and several hours waiting in the line in this heat JUST to get my marriage certificate. As an honest tax paying citizen, I am not just disgruntled, I am sad what this country has become.

&amp;#x200B;

For me, India lost today - Sometimes, I wonder if we would have been in a better place under British rule.

\[End of RANT\] 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR - Went to do a govt job done, took me 6x the legit price and 2 days without even buying me any convenience.

EDIT - I am aware I was at fault for not having explored the online option myself. I accept that. But regardless, the experience left much to be desired and it could certainly have been less painful."

Non-Political,"A way out, hopefully","TLDR: just want to run away from family, asking for help with a job before I do


Hey guys,
So I see a lot posts about someone being in depression and aren't sure what to do and seeking help. This is probably similar if not same.

About me, am 29 year old dude without any idea of what passion is or what kind of career I want to have. I have the most self absorbed parents who literally made every decision for me all the time. Hence, here I stand without a single clue on what I want to do and with marriage and constant pressure of joining the family business thrown at me everyday.

I am now forced into an internship in a foreign land where I am literally learning nothing about the nature of my family business nor anything on general that will give me confidence that I can be a part of said business. (I have tried to do self studies and online courses on supply chain, which is what the business is based and I honestly don't find it interesting)

Am I depressed? Possibly. Am I suicidal? Maybe. Everytime I don't have a distraction in front of me all I think of is to kill myself and just stop this shithole of life. I don't have a lot of friends, am sort of awkward around people and largely I don't have anything that is me anymore, I doubt and analyse everything that I do or like to figure out if I actually like it, or if I am used it.

I Know a lot of you will say, ""man just take a stand and do what you want, you are 29""; which is valid, I don't know why but I have never been a ""take a stand kind of person"" , plus it's not like my parents are abusive physically that I wanted to run away or something. It was just I hoped I could make them understand, but they never have and I think with the way things are going, they never will.

Coming to why am writing this, look I know it's a lot to ask for and I don't know if it's allowed either, am done man, I know if I don't run away now, I won't last this year, I feel it(bit cringey but I actually do), I was hoping to put myself out there if anybody is listening/reading and ask for a job. Am ready at this point to do anything, I'll work as anything, I don't mind salary, level or whatever.(I only have one request that it's as far from Bangalore as possible)

I have experience but I just couldn't get jobs for the last few months because I was either clueless on what to apply or my crippling low self confidence. 

If anyone is interested, I have worked in a startup for a couple of years and I know sql and some basic analytics. I have been told am a quick learner so I guess am totally not useless.

I really want to runaway, but I just need a job or something that keeps me busy, I know there are delivery jobs or I can just find something anywhere, I don't know of it makes sense, I guess the assurance of a job gives me the confidence to take that step.

If anyone wants to talk, please dm me, and I'll give my resume if you think am a good fit anywhere.(I know asking a lot, and I don't know what else to do at this moment). Other than that, just thanks for hearing me out I guess"

These characters would never have been possible if the writers/directors thought about morality, social responsibilty of the protagonists in a movie.

India: How a rich nation became poor and will be rich again

Essays | March 19, 2007 - 12:38

(Developing Cultures : Case Studies, co-edited by Peter Berger and Laurence Harrison, Routledge, 2005.)

Does 'culture' in some way help to explain the fact that the same Indian economy that was stagnating for the first fifty years of the 20th century began to grow at a respectable clip after 1980 and was amongst the fastest growing in the world by the end of the century?

Consider the following hundred year trend: between 1900 and 1950, the Indian economy grew on the average 0.8 percent a year; but the population also grew at about the same rate; thus, net growth in income per capita was nil and we rightly called our colonial economy stagnant. After Independence, economic growth picked up to 3.5 percent between 1950 and 1980, but so did population growth (to 2.2 percent); hence the net affect on income was 1.3 percent per capita, and this is what we mournfully referred to as “the Hindu rate of growth.” Things began to change with modest liberalization in the eighties when annual economic growth rose to 5.6 percent. This happy trend continued in the reform decade of the nineties when growth averaged 6.2 percent a year, while population slowed to 1.8 percent; thus, per capita income rose by a decent 4.4 percent a year.

As a benchmark, recall that the West's industrial revolution took place at a 3 percent GDP growth and 1.1 percent per capita income growth after 1820. To appreciate the magnitude of the Indian change after 1980, let me illustrate: If India's per capita GDP had continued growing at the pre-1980 level, then its income would have reached present American capita income levels only by 2250; but if it continues to grow at the post-1980 rate then it will reach those levels by 2066: a gain of 184 years!

How does one begin to explain India's economic performance over the past hundred years? The Indian nationalist blames the first fifty years' stagnation on British colonialism. But a trade economist will counter this by showing that the world economy was also stagnant in the first half of the 20th century (especially after World War I) when world per capita GDP grew annually at just under one percent.2 The main culprits, he would say, were conflict and autarky. Disgraceful protectionism by most governments between the Wars slowed both the world and the Indian economy.

Although the Indian economy picked up after 1950, the neoclassical economist would argue that it performed below the world economy, which experienced a “golden age” driven by trade expansion until 1971. Like the rest of the Third World India did not benefit from global trade expansion because it had closed its economy and pursued 'import substitution'. Moreover, Nehru's socialism had shackled the economy with fierce controls on the private sector, pejoratively called 'Licence Raj'; hence its annual GDP growth was 1.5 percentage points below even the Third World average between 1950 and 1980.3

This changed dramatically with modest liberal reforms in the 1980s and more sweeping ones in the 1990s as the Indian economy integrated with the world. In those twenty years it not only outperformed the world economy significantly but it was amongst the fastest in the world.4 Thus, gradual technological diffusion, rising capital accumulation and productivity, and gradual education expansion help economists to explain a good deal of the story. There is also the value of time and accumulated learning through time. “Collective learning” is Hayek's term, and he applied it to the cumulative experience that generations build up which is embodied in the language, the technology, and the way of doing things.5

But economic explanations are not enough. That India adopted democracy in 1950 before capitalism (in 1991) is also significant because democracy's redistributive pressures, such as free power to farmers and other subsidies, have dampened growth and also explain why India's reform process has been so painfully slow. Economists also find it puzzling why the liberal institutions of the British Raj did not engender faster growth during the colonial years. The rule of law, the relative peace of Pax Brittanica, a non-dirigiste administration, the railways and canals—all these were market friendly moves, after all.

I believe that national confidence also plays an important role. The more damaging impact of colonialism may well have been to Indian minds—it created an inferiority complex from which they have only recently recovered. Douglass North has rightly emphasized the importance of beliefs.6Businessmen understand the value of confidence in entrepreneurial success and in creating a climate for investment; Historians too emphasize the power of self-belief in national success--Roman history and Britain's rise in the 19th century are examples of this. After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose, especially as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism damaged that confidence. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, confidence returned and young Indian minds finally became decolonized. I traveled extensively across India in the 1990's when I discovered this changed mood, and I think it also explains the current economic success.7

I shall now amplify my arguments by taking the reader on a galloping tour of Indian economic history. From this story I shall draw lessons about the role of institutions and culture in development. En passant, I shall touch upon the great questions of Indian history: did the British impoverish India? Why didn't the railways engender an industrial revolution? Did Nehru's socialism dampen India's progress? What is the consequence of democracy preceding capitalism?

Let's begin with the Mughals

India's nationalist historians have portrayed its pre-colonial economy as a golden age of prosperity, and this fabulous wealth set the Europeans on their great voyages of discovery.8 During the Mughal Empire at the end of the 16th century, India's wealth did indeed sustain more than 100 million people. With plenty of arable land, its agriculture was certainly as productive as Western Europe's, and even the subsistence-oriented peasant got a decent return.9 India also had a large, skilled workforce that produced not only cotton but also luxuries for the aristocracy. Consequently, the economy produced a large financial surplus, which was used to support the growing Mughal Empire and finance spectacular monuments like the Taj Mahal.10

In 1497, the Portuguese sent Vasco da Gama with a flotilla of four ships to find India's wealth. But the two-year voyage was not a commercial success and the Indians were not interested in European clothes and goods for they made far ones in India. But Da Gama told King Manuel of Portugal of large cities, large buildings and rivers, and great populations. He spoke about spices and jewels, precious stones and “mines of gold.” He believed that he had found India's legendary wealth.11

It took the English a hundred years to discover this wealth. Initially, they came to plunder but soon discovered the rewards of trade. They found that India produced the world's best cotton yarn and textiles and in enormous quantities.12 What the Indians wanted in exchange from the Europeans was gold and silver, for which they had an insatiable appetite. Hence, there was a constant flow of gold to India, which absorbed a good deal of the bullion mined by the Spaniards in the New World. Having learned about cotton textiles from India, the English turned the tables, and brought an industrial revolution to Britain, but destroyed the lives of millions of Indian weavers.

India was a leading manufacturer in the 18th century

India was a leading manufacturing country in the world in the early 18th century. It had 22.6 percent share of the world's GDP, which came down to around 16 percent by 1820, closer to its share of world population.13 It had a developed banking system and vigorous merchant capital, with a network of agents, brokers and middlemen. Given the enormous financial surplus, a skilled artisan class, large exports, plenty of arable land and reasonable productivity, the question is why didn't a modern industrial economy emerge in India? Instead, why did India become impoverished?

Despite a dynamic and a growing commercial sector which responded to market forces and extensive foreign trade, the truth is that 18th century India was significantly behind Western Europe in technology, institutions and ideas. Neither an agricultural revolution, nor a scientific revolution had occurred, and in the long run the manual skill of the Indian artisan could be no substitute for technological progress,”14 and this would have needed new attitudes. Notwithstanding the surplus and the trade, mid-eighteenth India had a “per capita product perhaps two-thirds of that in England and France.”15

There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor. One explanation is that even in the 18th century India had a large population and plenty of cheap labor. Prosperity comes with rising productivity and a rise in productivity depends on technology. When the supply of labor is elastic, it is more economical to hire people than to invest in machines. Hence, an Englishman observed in 1807, “In India it is seldom that an attempt is made to accomplish anything by machinery that can be performed by human labour.”16 There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor.

Did the British Raj impoverish India?

India's nationalist historians have blamed the British Raj for India's poverty. The classic nationalist case is that India had been rich before the British came and colonialism weakened agriculture and “deindustrialized” India, throwing millions of artisans out of work. Britain's trade policies encouraged the import of manufactures and the export of raw materials; finally, it drained the wealth of India by transferring its capital to Britain.

Nationalists claimed that Lancashire's new textile mills crushed India's handloom textile industry and threw millions of weavers out of work. India's textile exports plunged from a leadership position before the start of the Britain's Industrial Revolution to a fraction. The indigenous banking system, which financed these exports, was also destroyed. Since the colonial government did not erect tariff barriers, Indian consumers shifted to cheaper English mill-made cloth and millions of handloom workers where left in misery. British colonial rule “de-industrialised” India (a favorite nationalist phrase) and from an exporter of textiles, India became an exporter of raw cotton.17

Britain also changed the old land revenue system to the disadvantage of the farmer, who had to now pay revenue whether or not the monsoon failed. This led to famines. The worst one in 1896-97 affected 96 million lives and killed an estimated 5 million people. Although the railways helped in the trade of food crops, the enlarged national market sucked away the peasant's surplus, which he had earlier stored for the bad years. Moreover, the British government transferred its surplus revenues back to England. Since India consistently exported more then she imported in the second half of the 19th century and early 20th century, Britain used India's trade surplus to finance her own trade deficit with the rest of the world, to pay for her exports to India, and for capital repayments in London. This represented a massive drain of India's wealth.18

In recent years some historians have challenged this nationalist picture. They have argued that Indian industry's decline in the 19th century was caused by technology. The machines of Britain's industrial revolution wiped out Indian textiles, in the same way that traditional handmade textiles disappeared in Europe and the rest of the world. Fifty years later Indian textile mills would have destroyed them. India's weavers were, thus, the victims of technological obsolescence.19

They also found that the land tax had not been exorbitant—by 1900 it was only 5 percent of the agricultural output or half the average per capita tax burden. There had been a “drain of wealth”, but it was only about 1.5 percent of GNP every year. The revisionist historians argued that India's payments to Britain were for real military and civilian services and to service capital investments. Also, the overhead cost of the British establishment—the so called “home charges”—was in fact quite small.20 If India had its own army and navy it would have spent more. True, India did have a balance of payments surplus, which Britain used to finance part of her deficit, but India was compensated by the import of gold and silver that went into private Indian hands.

India begins to re-industrize

Indian entrepreneurs began to set up their own modern textile mills after 1850 and very slowly began to recapture the domestic market. In 1896, Indian mills supplied 8% of the total cloth consumed in India; in 1913, 20%; in 1936, 62%; and by 1945, 76%.21Although India did not participate in global trade expansion between 1870 and 1913, Indian businessmen made large profits during the First World War, which they reinvested in after the war. Thus, India's manufacturing output grew 5.6 percent per year between 1913-38, well above the world average of 3.3 percent.” 22 The British government finally provided tariff protection from the 1920s, which helped industrialists to expand and diversify.

By Independence in 1947, Indian entrepreneurs were strong and in a position to buy out the businesses of the departing British. Industry's share in India's GNP had doubled from 3.8 percent (in 1913) to 7.5 percent (in 1947), and the share of manufactures in her exports rose from 22.4 percent (in 1913) to 30 percent (in 1947).

Why didn't an industrial revolution occur?

One of the intriguing questions of history is why India failed to create an industrial revolution. Karl Marx predicted that the railways would transform India and usher in an industrial revolution. Indeed, by the First World War, some thought that it was ready to take-off. By 1914, India had the third largest railway network, the world's largest jute manufacturing industry, the fourth largest cotton textile industry, the largest canal system, and 2.5 percent of world trade.23Although a colony, it had a very liberal regulatory regime--far more investor friendly than the one that replaced it after Independence—and after the 1920s the infant industry was also favored by tariffs. It had a merchant class hungry to become industrialists. Industrialization did, in fact, pick up after the War and industry's share in national output doubled. But it was not enough to broadly transform an agricultural society. Modern industry employed only 2.5 million people out of population of 350 million.

Amiya Kumar Bagchi, the Marxist economist, suggests that the reason was the lack of effective demand during the colonial period, and this limited business opportunity. Indians were just too poor to buy modern goods and services.24 If the domestic Indian market was small, couldn't the entrepreneur have supplemented it by producing for export? Morris D. Morris, blames supply constraints.25 An Indian entrepreneur was uncompetitive because of a shortage of technology, skilled labor, and capital—all of which raised his cost of his production. The historian, Rajat Ray, argues that Indian businessmen did not export because they made inferior products, unacceptable to the world market. In his view, technological backwardness was the single biggest failing.26 But surely, they could have imported technology, as Jamshedji Tata, G.D. Birla, and others did.

Unlike nationalist historians, I do not think there was a British conspiracy to deliberately under-invest in India or sabotage Indian business interests. Bombay's textile mills were built with the credit, technical assistance and machines from Britain although they were a competitive threat to the Manchester's mills. I believe the industrial revolution did not occur because Indian agriculture remained stagnant, and you cannot have an industrial revolution without an agricultural surplus or the means to feed a rapidly growing urban population; second, the international trading environment turned hostile with protectionism after the First World War, followed by the Depression; third, the colonial government did not educate the masses, unlike the Japanese state; finally, a colonial mindset pervaded the Indian middle class--even the hardiest potential entrepreneur lacks confidence when he is politically enslaved.

What is the verdict on British rule?

Did the British impoverish India? There is no question that in the 18th century it plundered and looted India's wealth, as all conquerors have done in history. But did it create on-going institutions that were to India's detriment? This has to do with the nature and theory of colonialism. True, its Industrial Revolution threw millions of weavers out of work, but it would have happened any way when the new technology reached India. British government policy could have cushioned the impact by erecting trade barriers and saved enormous amount of human suffering, but protecting handlooms would have been a temporary palliative.

Odd as it may seem, I believe that Britain did not “exploit” India enough. Had it made the massive investments in India that it did in the Americas, India would have become more prosperous and a much bigger market for British goods. A richer India would have been a better customer, a better supplier, and a firmer basis of Empire.27 Britain's main failure was not to educate the Indian masses—hence 83 percent of Indians were illiterate at Independence. Britain's education system in India produced only a thin upper crust of extremely well educated Indians, while the masses remained illiterate.28

Although Britain could not lift Indians out of poverty, nor avert famines, it did give India the institutions of democracy--the rule of law, an independent judiciary and a free press. It built railways, canals, and harbors. It gave India almost a hundred years of peace—the Pax Britannica. Although it gave modern values and institutions, it did not interfere with its ancient traditions and religion. Hence, India has preserved its spiritual heritage and the old way of life continues. Many despair over the divisiveness of caste, but the hold of the Indian way of life is also a bulwark against the onslaught of the global culture.

Independence and 'License Raj'

After Independence, democracy took root in India and gradually the masses acquired a stake in the system, periodically electing representatives even from the lowest castes. The rulers also adopted a Fabian socialist economic path, and Indians did not turn to capitalism until 1991, although there was modest liberalization of the economy in the 1980s. Thus, India embraced democracy before capitalism, which makes its journey to modernity unique and explains a good deal.

Jawaharlal Nehru and his planners did not trust private entrepreneurs; so they made the state the entrepreneur, and not surprisingly, they failed to create an industrial revolution. Instead, India experienced an agricultural revolution in the early 1970s. It thus had an important pre-condition for the industrial revolution—an agricultural surplus—but the industrial take-off eluded it. Its investment rate also rose from 6 percent to well over 20 per cent, and yet it did not engender a take-off. Why?

I think there were at least six things wrong with India's mantra: one, it adopted an inward-looking, import-substituting path rather than an outward-looking, export-promoting route; it thus denied itself a share in world trade and the prosperity that trade brought in the post-War era. Two, it set up a massive, inefficient, and monopolistic public sector to which it denied autonomy of working; hence, its investments were not productive and it had a poor capital-output ratio. Three, it over-regulated private enterprise with the worst controls in the world, and this diminished competition in the market; four, it discouraged foreign capital and denied itself the benefits of technology and world class competition. Five, it pampered organized labor to the point that it has extremely low productivity. Six, it ignored the education of its children.

Nehru's strategic planner, P.C. Mahalanobis, made two wrong assumptions. He assumed that there were no opportunities for rapid export expansion in the 1950s, and this turned out to be wrong. India discovered that tiny Hong Kong could earn more from its exports than the whole of India, as India's share of world trade declined from 2.2 percent in 1947 to 0.5 percent in 1990. He also assumed that competition was wasteful, and this was also a flawed idea because there can be little improvement in productivity without it.

Even more damaging were the creeping controls on the private sector. The most bizarre was the licensing system. It began with the Industrial Licensing Act of 1951, which required an entrepreneur to get a license to set up a new unit, to expand it, or change the product mix. A huge number of untrained clerks, engineers, bureaucrats at the Directorate General of Technical Development, operating on the basis of inadequate information vetted thousands of applications on an ad hoc basis. These low level functionaries took months in the futile, micro-review of an application and finally sent it for approval to the administrative ministry. The ministry again lost months reviewing the same data before it sent the application to an inter-ministerial licensing committee. After the Minister's approval, the investor had to seek approval for the import of machinery from the capital goods licensing committee. If finance was needed from a State financial institution, the same scrutiny had to be repeated afresh. The result was enormous delays, sometimes lasting years with staggering opportunities for corruption.

Large business houses set up parallel bureaucracies in Delhi, to follow up on their files, organize bribes, and win licenses. If the entrepreneur did finally get started and made a success of his enterprise, he was again in trouble. It was an offence punishable under the law to manufacture beyond the capacity granted by the license. India became the only country in the world where the production of sorely needed goods sorely was punishable by law.29

The system ended in thwarting competition, entrepreneurship and growth, without achieving any of its social objectives. It fostered monopolies and it proliferated uneconomic-size plants in remote, uncompetitive locations, employing second-rate technology. Bureaucrats who did not have a clue about the basics of running a business made the decisions on the choice of technology, the size and location of plants.

Although it was becoming clear that India was on the wrong path by the late sixties, instead of changing course after Nehru, Indira Gandhi introduced more controls. She nationalized banks, discouraged foreign investment, and placed more hurdles before domestic enterprise. Hence, industrial growth plunged from 7.7 per cent a year between 1951-1965 to 4.0 per cent between 1966-1980. Productivity of Indian manufacturing declined half a percent a year from 1960 to 1985.30

“1966-1980 is effectively the dark period for the Indian economy.”31. It is harder to blame Nehru for adopting the economic wrong model for socialism was the wisdom of his age and dozens of economists visited India and hailed his bold experiment.32 It is right to blame Indira Gandhi, for by then Japan's miracle was evident, and Korea and Taiwan were following its footsteps. However, ideology is only one part of the story. An important reason for non-performance was poor implementation. Even Nehru's socialism could have delivered more and did not have to degenerate into “License Raj”.

India after the Reforms

Although there was modest liberalization in the 1980s, the decisive turning point came in July 1991 when the minority government of Narasimha Rao announced sweeping reforms. It opened the economy to foreign investment and trade; it dismantled import controls, lowered customs duties, devalued the currency and made the rupee convertible on the trade account; it virtually abolished licensing controls on private investment, dropped tax rates and broke public sector monopolies. As a result growth rose to 7.5 percent a year for three years in a row in the mid-nineties, inflation came down from 13 percent to 6 percent by 1993, exchange reserves shot up from $1 billion to $20 billion by 1993, and had crossed $100 billion by end 2003. This was as important a turning point as Deng's revolution in China in December 1978. Surprisingly, the elected coalition governments that succeeded Rao continued the reform process, and despite its slow, incremental pace, it has made India one of the fastest growing major economies in the world.33

Indians have traditionally not accorded a high place to making money. Hence, the merchant or bania is placed third in the four-caste hierarchy, behind the brahmin and the kshatriya, and only a step ahead of the laboring shudra. After the economic reforms making money became increasingly respectable and the sons of brahmins and kshatriyas began to get MBAs and wanted to become entrepreneurs. The business pages of newspapers became livelier; chief ministers in the states scrambled for private investment; judges became more even-handed in industrial disputes. As a result, India is in the midst of a social revolution rivalled, perhaps, only by the ascent of Japan's merchant class during the 1968 Meiji Restoration.

There has also been mental revolution. And a changed attitude to English illustrates this new mindset. Ever since the British left Indians constantly carped against the English language. But in the 1990s this carping seemed to die, and quietly, without ceremony English became one of the Indian languages. English lost its colonial stigma, oddly enough, around the time that the Hindu nationalists came to power. Young Indians in the new middle class think of English as a skill, like Windows. This is why Hinglish (Hindi mixed with English) is spreading. Encouraged by flourishing private television channels and supported by their advertisers, the newly emerging middle classes avidly embrace this uninhibited hybrid of Hindi and English, and this popular idiom of the bazaar is rushing down the socio-economic ladder. The purists naturally disapprove, but people are more comfortable and accepting of it today because Indians are more relaxed and confident as a people. Their minds have become decolonized.

The world, meanwhile, also changed from an industrial to the information economy, and it seemed to speak to India's advantage, symbolized by its success in software and business process outsourcing. These “Bangalores” have given Indians confidence and they reflect a new social contract. The new entrepreneurs did not inherit wealth; they have risen on the back of their talent, hard work, and professional skills. A new self-belief has emerged among urban youth that doesn't need approval from others, especially from the West. Music composers like A.R. Rehman display an exuberant nonchalance, as do the new young Bollywood pop stars. So do new fiction writers like Arundhati Roy, designers of fashion clothes, beauty queens and cricket stars.

Some lessons

Neoclassical economic theory explains a great deal about why the Indian economy that was stagnating in the first half of the 20th century went on to become one of the fastest growing by the end of the century. It tells us, for example, that disgraceful protectionism by governments in the inter-war years in the first half of the 20th century dampened world trade and slowed down the world and the Indian economies. It also explains why India performed below the world average between 1950-1980: thinking that trade had impoverished her in the colonial period, India closed its economy and denied itself the fruits of a “golden period” in world trade between 1950 and 1970; “License Raj” and other institutions of Nehru's socialism also suppressed growth. Finally, neoclassical economics explains how by dismantling controls and integrating the economy with the global economy, the Indian economy has become more competitive and is growing rapidly after the reforms.

But this is not the whole story, and we must turn to institutions and attitudes to understand the incentive structure of the Indian society.60 Indians blame colonialism for impoverishing them. But we have seen that colonialism is a more complex tale. For example, it did not 'de-industrialize' India as the nationalists argued; handloom textiles died in India (and the world) because of technological obsolescence. Colonialism's bigger damage was to the loss of Indian confidence, which inhibited Indian entrepreneurs. This confidence began to grow with Gandhi's freedom movement in the first half of the 20th century, and industrialization did pick up. However, its impact on society was insufficient to create an industrial revolution.

After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism acted as a damper. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, self-assurance returned to the Indian marketplace. Today's mood in India is opposite to what existed a hundred years ago. Insecurity and inferiority filled colonial India, which is all too apparent in the writings of Bengali writers of the 19th century, such as Bankim Chandra Chatterji. Today, writers like Salman Rushdie and Arundhati Roy exhibit a matter of fact assuredness (almost a cool) that is a reflection of changed national mindset.

India embraced democracy first and capitalism afterwards and this has made a difference. India became a full-fledged democracy in 1950, with universal suffrage and extensive human rights, but it was not until 1991 that it opened up to the free play of market forces. For the rest of the world it has been the other way around. In the West, suffrage was extended gradually in the last century, and as mass political parties developed, democracy began to impinge on capitalist institutions and practices.

India's democracy has an overwhelming majority of poor voters--70 per cent still live in rural areas; organized labor constitutes less than 10 per cent of total labor; and the middle class is around 20 per cent of the population. Because of democratic pressures, India tried to redistribute the pie before it was baked. It set up intricate regulatory networks before the private economy had transformed a rural into an industrial society. It began to think in terms of “welfare” before there were welfare-generating jobs. The result, as we have seen, was a throttling of enterprise, slow growth, and missed opportunities. It is the price India has paid for having democracy before capitalism—or rather too much democracy and not enough capitalism.

Since politics is a short run game and growth is a long run one there will never be a situation that is completely optimal. This explains why Indian politicians do not bother about education because results take a long time to come. When a politician promises rice for two rupees a kilo when it costs five rupees in the market, he wins the election. Since the mid-1960s politicians have vigorously competed in giving away free goods and services to voters. When politicians do that, where is the money to come for creating schools or improving old ones? India's damaging fiscal deficit (around 10 percent of GDP for the center and states combined) is a testimonial to the downside of competitive politics, and it teaches that the demand for publicly provided goods and services is insatiable in a democracy.

But India's problems of governance go far beyond the need to appease interests. The weakening of its democratic institutions since Indira Gandhi in the 1970s has caused widespread corruption, political violence, populist giveaways, and a paralysis of problem solving. Conspicuously absent are disciplined party organizations, which help leaders in other democracies to mobilize support for specific programs. Hence, there is an excessive reliance on the personal appeal of individual leaders to win elections. When in power leaders tend to take the easy way out, which is not to act at all.

Will capitalism, and its cousin globalization succeed in establishing a comfortable place for themselves in India? The answer depends on their ability to deliver prosperity broadly. It also depends on leaders in the government and in business to champion the classic liberal premises of free trade and competition. It needs leaders to come out say that (1) some people will not fare as well in the competitive market place; (2) the winners will far outnumber the losers; (2) capitalist democracy is the best arrangement we have found; (4) globalization is not only a good thing, it is a great leap forward in history. My fear is that capitalism's success in India is threatened not so much by the leftists or protectionists but by the timidity of its defenders.

The curious historic inversion between democracy and capitalism means that India's path into the future is evolving through a daily dialogue between the conservative forces of caste, religion and the village, the leftist and Nehruvian socialist forces which dominated the intellectual life of the country for 40 years, and the new forces of global capitalism. These “million negotiations of democracy” slow down the pace of economic reforms, but they also mean that India might have a more stable, peaceful, and negotiated transition into the future than say China. It might also avoid some of the deleterious side effects of an unprepared capitalist society, such as Russia. Although slower, India is more likely to preserve its way of life and it's civilization of diversity, tolerance, and spirituality against the onslaught of the global culture.

Does culture matter?

Cultural explanations have been a vigorous industry in India for more than a hundred years. Colonial officials routinely blamed India's poverty on the otherworldly spirituality of Hindu life and its fatalistic beliefs. Max Weber attributed the absence of development to the caste system. Gunnar Myrdal, the Swedish economist, found that India's social system and attitudes were an important cause of its “low level equilibrium” of low productivity, primitive production techniques, and low levels of living.34

Deepak Lal, another economist, similarly explained economic stagnation in a low level “Hindu equilibrium” around the caste system, which bought stability in the context of political warfare, monsoon failure and climatic uncertainty, labor shortage, and an under-valued merchant class.35 David Landes, the historian, blames the enervating heat, which is deleterious to work. For this reason, rich countries lie in temperate zones and the poor in the tropics and semi-tropics.36

While institutions and culture do matter undoubtedly, we are all skeptical of national stereotypes and easy cultural explanations of the sort that were common hundred years ago. In my experience, successful Hindu entrepreneurs can be both extremely otherworldly in religion and aggressive in business. The Indian farmer, despite being caught in the caste system, responds quickly to market based incentives, as the Green Revolution testifies. Brahmins, who are supposed to have contempt for manual labor, will plough their land vigorously if they have to. And Rajput Thakurs, who never worked for a living, will shed their feudal ways for the sake of a commercial opportunity. Moreover, there are substantial non-Hindus in India and these communities had also been stuck in the same rut of stagnation. Other Asian countries were equally backward, but they had no “Hindu equilibrium” to explain away their stagnation. Finally, the same Indians when they migrate to other countries perform better.

Thus, I am uncomfortable with the “otherworldly values of the Hindus” or the “immobilizing effects of the caste system” and the “conservative habits of the merchant caste”. I believe that Sir John Hicks' Economic Principle does trump in most cases. It states that “people would act economically; when the opportunity of an advantage was presented to them they would take it.”37 It explains not only the diffusion of the Green Revolution across India but also the demographic transitions currently underway in many states.

When seeking an explanation for a nation's wealth and poverty, my preferred method is to begin with economic factors as proximate causes that motivate a businessman to invest--the size of the market, the capability of suppliers, distribution hurdles, and the state of competition. If this does not satisfy, I seek answers in institutions, some of which are, of course, intimately tied to culture. I have found that institutions can evolve rapidly as incentives change in society and can be transferred fairly quickly; for example, during the 1990s India was able to dismantle many of the institutions of Nehruvian socialism and replace them with capitalist institutions. Finally, if none of these factors provide a satisfactory explanation, then I turn to attitudes and social structure.

I find Deepak Lall's distinction between material and cosmological beliefs useful.38The material beliefs of a civilization are about ways of making a living and are the subject of economics; cosmological ones are about how to live and are in the realm of 'culture'. The rise of the west was accompanied by a change in both sets of beliefs, but East Asia's success has needed mainly a change in material beliefs—it has become prosperous without losing its soul. In other words, it is possible to modernize without westernizing. Ever since the British Raj material beliefs have been changing in India unlike our cosmological beliefs.

Our continuing inability to distinguish between the “modern” and the “western” in India is surely the cause of some of our grief. If we could only accept that a great deal of modern western culture, especially its material beliefs, are not the West's property, but are a universal, critical way of thinking, which belongs to all rational human beings. We would not waste our energies on swadeshi (protectionism) hindutva (preserving the ancient Hindu civilization), and futile language debates (“remove English from primary schools”). The debate between modernisation and westernisation, begun in early nineteenth century by Ram Mohan Roy, continues to rage in India. At the root is a fear of the loss of the Indian way of life. The older generation fears it more than the young, whose minds are more decolonised and who are more confident in adopting the West's material beliefs without fearing the loss in its cosmological ones.

Science/Technology,What is the Future of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in INDIA?," 

A news report published in October in The Economic Times said, “Start-ups witness 108% growth in funding in India in 2018.” The news report further mentioned that Artificial Intelligence was among those domains which witnessed the fastest adoption among industry sectors. **Currently, there are about 400 start-ups working on AI and machine learning domains. About $150 million dollars is invested in India’s AI sector by private players alone and the number has been growing since 2016**. Though there has been growth, India lags far behind countries like the US and China in terms of investment. With a copious pool of STEM talent and with a growing population of youngsters, India will be banking on AI for its economic growth and improvement in the quality of life of its citizens.

There are several start-ups that are based in cities such as Bengaluru, New Delhi, Mumbai and Hyderabad which work on artificial intelligence principles to serve consumers better. Their product range varies from multi-lingual chatbots to online shopping assistance and automated consumer data analysis

* **THE ROAD AHEAD**

The National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence which was put together by the government of India through NITI Aayog sets the roadmap on how to develop AI in the country. The report points out how AI will help the country grow, what are the strengths and what are the challenges on the way. The government has identified a few areas where it thinks AI will play a crucial role as far as India is concerned

 

Capital and qualified manpower are the two main pillars that are required for the establishment and growth of any sector. India is home to a large talent pool of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math graduates. Companies such as Google, Intel and Microsoft have been offering short term training programs to computer program developers which help them upskill in the area of AI programming. On the other hand AICTE, the government body which governs and regulates professional education in India, recently added AI, IoT, Machine Learning and few other subjects as mandatory subjects in its curriculum of B.Tech programs. Changes in curriculum and content are further expected in the days to come.

Investment towards AI from private players has been increasing in India ($44 million in 2016 to $77 million in 2017). The start-ups have been working towards developing various AI-based products and services. With conglomerates having a lion’s share in India’s market, there is huge scope for AI-based enterprise solutions in the country. The increasing demand for products and services can attract more investment towards R&D in AI sector

Science/Technology,1st year ECE graduate who again wants to give Jee Mains. I'm confused and in need of help.,"Please, I literally don't have anyone to talk with about this thing which is eating my head. 

I passed 12th in 2018, and gave jee for the 1st time. Faired miserably and repeated a year and again gave it in 2019. Again didn't study properly and faired badly. Got into an okay okay private college called Heritage Institute of Technology in Kolkata. I'm studying ECE(Electronics and communication engineering) out there.

I've always wanted to study Computer science. With that in mind, I started trying to study discrete math from online resources. However, after finding the road too steep, I gave up. I thought, it'll be better to get a CS degree.

With that in mind, I decided to write Jee again.

In a private college, cracking GATE is my best option to go to a better place, but I doubt if I'll be capable enough to crack it and get into a better college. So I thought, better to write Jee again and try and get some private college with better placement opportunity so that I won't always be in uncertainty over my future.

But now, I don't know if this is the best decision. I don't know what to do. Whether to give up with Jee or continue. I sometimes feel embarrassed to give the exam again. I hate myself, my choices. I don't really know what I want from life. It's like I'm just doing things, not going anywhere - life has no direction. 
It's a rant, I've no one to discuss this situation with."

He was telling me that almost everyone including students & faculty is pissed off with the recent appointment of Mr. Gajendra as director. 

People there at large feel the man is not at all qualified for the job and students are planning for a massive protest against the high-handed appointment. There was no prior consultation was faculty member there whatsoever.

Now I did some digging and found out there seems to be pattern amongst all of the recent appointments.

I understand when a new govt comes to power it appoints its own people to the govt offices. When UPA came to power in 2004, it replaced most of the state governers with its own sympathizers. Now that BJP has come to power, it did the same thing except Mr. Najib Jung. **Fair enough and pretty much consistent**

But one thing I don't get is why is BJP appointing unqualified people in the institutions of national importance? How does it serve any purpose? Isn't it against the very philosophy of Make In India? If you want India to develop, you need to have qualified guardians at the institutions of national importance.

I understand that India academia is highly influences by leftist ideology which I personally despise. I'm libertarian & pro-capitalism when it comes to economic ideology. 

BJP is Far Right Wing which has pro-capitalism as economic philosophy at its core. But how do recent appointments justify it? If right wing is about market capitalism, should not BJP give more autonomy to these institutions, instead of screwing up their reputation with high-handed appointments.

I understand top brass of BJP/RSS feel that curricula of Indian education system is against Indian culture/traditions. They also feel that history subject is biased. But if they want to change it, shouldn't they do it at the school level. 

Anyway institutions like IIT/TIFR/IISSc/IIMs are mostly about science, technology & technology. So, why messing with them?

India already doesn't have any Univ in the top 300 ranking of QS world ranking. With recent high-handed appointments, I'm sure their quality will take a nosedive.

This is pretty much my thoughts. Let us please discuss it. I would request people not to take sides. Please be objective in your analysis based on logic. It's not about BJP/Congress/AAP. It's about me and your future.

EDIT: WHat the hell! Seems, downvoting brigade is already activated. C'mon yaar, it took me a lot efforts to dig all the relevant info, I would request you not to downvote it. Please leave this thread if you dont wanna participate.

Some background - I graduated from a private college with a BTech degree with average marks. I had some interest in coding since school days that's why I opted for Computer Science. But in the past few months I have come to realize the work I am doing right now is menial and I don't have the skills required to get a job in a good tech company. I have been trying to study to improve them. But without any set target or deadline, I have just wasted the time procrastinating. Also a couple of failed job interviews has made me to think to stop planning about switching and do something else. Like post graduation. GATE and CAT are the only options I have been thinking about because I don't want to study abroad. I have been more inclined towards CAT because syllabus of GATE is vast and since I feel I am good in Logical and Verbal problem solving, given a 8-9 month preparation period I might crack the CAT exam with good percentile. But then I am not sure whether I should leave the tech side for good and switch to management instead.

Please give me some advise about what I should do now. Also please share if anything else comes to your mind that can work for me."

Science/Technology,ISRO's Second Launch Attempt For Chandrayaan 2 Today At 2:43 pm,
Science/Technology,Let's discuss the state of Indian intelligence agencies in terms of cyber power.,"While almost every week there is a story or another about the NSA, CIA, GHCQ invading the privacy of the citizens, launching attacks against cyber criminals, putting people on certain _lists_ for using Tor etc.,  Indian intelligence agencies have been off the radar. I have a strong feeling that it's not because they choose to, but because they lack the skills.

Why do you think that is?  The NSA, SIS, GHCQ, FBI etc. make it a point to hire top security professionals and even hire interns directly from universities. The candidates selected consider it as a good career path, both in terms of serving the nation and in terms of intellectual satisfaction. Compare it with the state in India, where RAW and IB don't even have a dedicated website. I understand the need for secrecy, but at least have a fucking portfolio! One cannot even directly apply to RAW. One needs to join some other government department and then one gets transferred. (like seriously?). Just have a look at [NSA](https://www.intelligencecareers.gov/nsa/), [GHCQ](https://www.gchq-careers.co.uk/recruitment-process.html), [FBI] (http://www.fbiagentedu.org/careers/cyber-crimes/), [SIS](https://www.sis.gov.uk/science-and-technology.html) career websites and then look at Indian [IB's](http://mha.nic.in/vacancies) (No, there isn't even a webpage specific to IB and like I said, one cannot directly get into RAW). Would a person who is **actually** skilled even want to apply or work here? I don't think so.

I believe that India has not paid enough attention to strengthening its cyber power. I believe that we need to have some _Kevin Mitnick_ sort of personalities to wreak havoc on the cyber security front by unlawful activities. (Instead of fakers like Ankit Fadia). Why?

* There's huge money to be made in it.
* The Indian intelligence agencies won't be able to catch you (unskilled that I think they are).
* Even if they figure out you were behind it, you could easily hide in the 1.252 billion population that India has. 
* The infrastructure to attack is highly outdated and vulnerable (For instance [this](https://www.troyhunt.com/43-203-indian-patient-pathology-reports-were-left-publicly-exposed-by-health-solutions/).).

My worst fear is that if there is a war in the future, it will be a cyber war, and India will be left devastated. It's not that we don't have the skills, it's just that the government needs a slap on its face. Like seriously, our government needs to change. How can a few babulog sitting behind desks who have no clue about technology properly shape the laws concerning cyber security and privacy? Why can't our leaders debate about such technical issues during election campaigns (like Hillary and Trump did) ? They don't because they don't feel such issues are important enough. Like I said before, we need some big hacks to happen in order to stir things up."

So let us strive to make more informed choices in future be more wise , make sure we try to change tracks for cleaner technology.

Science/Technology,[TIL] You can pay 'Indian Medical Association' (IMA) and get your commercial product endorsed by them.,"While watching world cup, I noticed almost 3 to 4 products getting endorsed by IMA, be it a water purifier, soap, juice, toothpaste.

It has become quite an easy way for brands to gain credibility among their customer base. By paying only about 50 lakhs, you can get IMA's nod and use their logo on your product.

Main objectives of IMA includes, promotion and advancement of medical and all related sciences, improving public health and medical education in India, and maintaining the honour and dignity of the medical profession.

Science/Technology,"[NP]Engineering Education In India: Hot Intake, Cold Results","Under the new NDA government, there has been a rush to establish a glut of premier technical institutions. A proposal for six new IITs has been ratified, in addition to the nine new ones already established in 2008. The total number of candidates in the JEE (Mains) was 12.5 lakhs this year. The All India Council for Technical Education recognizes a whopping 6,378 institutions for undergraduate engineering study, with a humongous intake of 31.78 lakh. The All-India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE) report for the year 2013-14 pegs the proportion of undergraduate enrolment in engineering, technology and computer fields combined at 20.08%, second only to the combined field of Arts, Humanities and the Social Sciences.

However, does quantity mean quality? Does offering long-reaching career choices to students not old enough to vote or drink, and parents out of sync with the current market and research scenario fare well in the context of Indian higher education?

**Indicators of Concern**

*Employability*

The National Employability Report published by Aspiring Minds in 2015 presents worrying numbers that paint a sorry picture. It found a meagre 17.91% engineers employable in the software services sector, and an abysmal 3.67% in the software products sector. In non-IT roles, the statistics were as alarming, with only 6.5% and 5.55% engineers employable in design roles in electrical and mechanical engineering respectively. 

The report comments that most candidates lack basic programming and algorithmic knowledge, and in non-IT core roles, there is lack of a clear grasp of fundamentals, which is often the only thing required by recruiters. In fact, it says that 60% of engineers lag behind by not possessing specific domain knowledge. 

The go-to option for a burgeoning class of aspirers, engineering represents the “easy path”, and a focus on end results eclipses learning processes. Moreover, choices of specialization are made based on entrance examination ranks, before any taste of specialised curricula or actual field work in a particular subject. Such ill-informed decision-making is bound to generate an outpouring of reluctant engineers who are confused and ill-equipped in their respective areas. 

*Output*

The other important outcome of technical education is research and development. Contributing to advancing technology in terms of academic research and patents is an important development indicator, as R&D output has direct effects on economic prosperity and standard of living. 

The SCImago Journal & Country Rank rates publications and countries in terms of research output in different fields. Ranking countries by citations-per-document published, which indicates the average number of times a paper has been cited by other works, we find India ranked a middling 40th among 87 nations with at least 1000 engineering publications from 1996 to 2014. 

According to data collected by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) on selected indicators of innovation among labs and higher educational institutions in 2014, we find India comes 31st out of 48 ranked entities in terms of patents filed per GDP as a percentage (including a combined number for the EU, which comes above India). 

We see how India languishes in the middle in terms of both patents and it the citation counts of academic publications. What forces are afoot that drag India’s comparative performance into mediocrity despite the colossal undergraduate intake? Let’s crunch some numbers to get to the bottom of it.

**A Chain of Causes**

*Postgraduate Education*

Research output also measures the health of postgraduate and doctoral education in the countries, signalling the willingness of undergraduates to continue in the field of their choosing. A report published in 2013 by the South Asia Development Sector of the World Bank says that 94.56% of engineering students in India are undergraduates, with only 5.4% in Master’s programs, the lowest but for Brazil. 

At the same time, a 2014 report published by the Student Exchange and Visitor Program (SEVP) in the United States says that a huge majority (81%) of India-based graduate students are in STEM fields. 

This data points to a prevalent scenario in which limited information and social pressure compels undergraduates to pick engineering, but the higher education machinery fails to retain numbers at postgraduate levels, at least in India.  Students who can afford it fly abroad, especially to the US for search of better options in education and employment. 
The AISHE 2013-14 report also says that only 9% of its respondents who had enrolled in postgraduate courses went on to pursue a PhD in the field, which links us to the next issue. 

*Throttled Funds*

The dearth of doctoral students in engineering fields owes itself in no small part to inadequate compensation. Junior research fellows take home Rs. 25,000 per month, while senior PhD candidates get Rs. 28,000. Moreover, insufficient funds are allocated to science and engineering research, making the production of high quality matter more challenging. 
International Science and Engineering Indicators published by the National Science Foundation of the USA include the proportion of GDP expended on R&D, based on which India ranks 40th among 60 nations studied, with a lowly 0.81%
. 

*Teacher Numbers*

Above, we saw how small a percentage of students transition to postgraduate and doctoral studies in their fields, and by extension, the number of qualified teachers at college level falls down, denting the prospects of a proper education for subsequent generations of students, creating a vicious loop of negative feedback. 

Two other statistics and their comparisons in the above mentioned World Bank report signal a severe shortage of teaching resources in the engineering education arena.

Using general higher education statistics from MHRD reports in 2011, the report estimates the average faculty per institution at 19, and the student-to-faculty ratio at 24. The latter ratio depicts the even spreading of teaching resources, and a high value means lesser attention to every individual student’s learning objectives. To put the number into perspective, the AICTE recommends a ratio of 12 at undergraduate level, and 15 at graduate level. 

With better-paying avenues in regular jobs, most fresh graduates stay away from the lengthy and arduous path of academia and teaching.

**Conclusions**

The lack of postgraduates, doctoral researchers, and the best teachers prevents the blossoming of a rewarding academic atmosphere and thus makes departments accumulate reluctant and untrained teachers, by making them unattractive to the best talents.  This stunts exposure to good teaching and research for undergraduates, which in turn contributes to disillusionment, insufficient interest and technical knowledge, low employability rates, and a departure from technical fields of work and study post their first degree, feeding the crippling dearth of skills and results at higher levels.

My aim is land a well paying  job after college. DTU has a lot of non tech placements in analyst/consulting roles which are open for all branches and most non Cs students opt for that. I don't know much about that field and if it is right for me or not.
If I go for DU colleges, they don't have good placements after Bsc and one would have to go for masters like MBA/Ms in India or abroad.

Science/Technology,Seeking a laptop suggestion.,"I'm sorry if these kind of posts are not allowed here. I'll take this down if it is the case. 

I've already posted on r/suggestalaptop but didn't get any response. 

I'm looking for a laptop for video editing and maybe some casual gaming. My budget is capped at ₹70000. Below is the form I filled on another subreddit.

Before I put the form in here, Laptops in India are hell lot of expensive. What costs around \~$800 in US is sold here at \~$1100 at least. On an average they cost about 40% higher here in India than the US counterpart.   
for instance: Apple MacBook Pro 15"" with 2.6 GHz i7 (9th gen) costs \~$3650 here.

So you get the point.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, AMDs are seen less in Indian market for ""who knows"" what reasons. There are only Ryzen 5 2500U, 3550H and a Ryzen 3. No Ryzen 7.

OK enough. I'm sorry.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the form:

&amp;#x200B;

\* \*\*Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications for the money? Pick or include any that apply.\*\*  

Not a fan of 2 in 1 form factor, good enough battery life maybe 3-4 hours of real world usage is enough. Best performance for  the money.  I don't want to rush for specs but performance.

&amp;#x200B;

\* \*\*How important is weight and thinness to you?\*\*  

4 on scale of 10

&amp;#x200B;

\* \*\*Which OS do you require? Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Linux.\*\* 

Linux preferably or Windows.

&amp;#x200B;

\* \*\*Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.\*\*   

anything bigger than 15""  

&amp;#x200B;

\* \*\*Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.\*\*  

Softwares:

Adobe Photoshop CS 6

DaVinci Resolve 16

&amp;#x200B;

Games:

Far Cry 5, COD WW, Forza Horizon 4 and similar games

&amp;#x200B;

\* \*\*If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?\*\*  

No specific games, Far Cry 5, COD WW, Forza Horizon 4 and similar games as I get my hands on them.

&amp;#x200B;

\* \*\*Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?\*\*   

Good Display because video and photo editing work and good enough build.

&amp;#x200B;

\* \*\*Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.\*\* 

Are there companies which offer global warranty or lets you transfer the warranty to other countries? Because I was thinking if I could ask a friend to buy one for me in US and then bring it over here.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, every model isn't available in India.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there any longevity difference between GTX 1660 and GTX 1060. Like which one of them would loose support or something in near future.  

&amp;#x200B;

Science/Technology,Automation In Our Society,"
One word has become synonymous with the current economy and job market, that's automation. Automation has been happening all around us for years, but the pace of it has increased substantially in recent times. We are staring at highly automated work environments where the need for people has become inefficient, automation has crept up slowly across industries and has become a major threat to future economies of countries. The problem is, that there hasn't been a concrete solution, no one seems to be agreeing on what could be the solution to this. 


Automation, in manufacturing industry has been constantly increasing, the coveted assembly line model by Henry Ford that streamlined the manufacturing process by making it efficient has in these modern times been a reason for automation to take over jobs. A decade or two ago you could see people working in assembly line, but now if you go to any manufacturing plant there is a high chance that you'll be seeing people only doing quality inspection on the assembly lines instead of doing any assembly, that's because all of it is being done by Robots that have gotten so efficient and cost effective in the long run that there is no reason to have people assembling it. 


Look at the IT sector for an example a decade ago when you dialled a customer support of a company there would be people picking up your phone and addressing you concern or complaints but now when you call customer support of a company, it's a jumbled mess of pre recorded options that you press, if you are lucky and have pressed the right options for a couple of times you might get lucky and actually have a person who might address your problem. Now think about both of these examples, the expertise required for assembling has been replaced by inspection of assembled stuff, which requires much less technical knowledge and experience. Same goes for the IT sector, now a couple of hundred of people can handle a country's customer support because of pre recorded options. This has obviously helped in increasing productivity in both industries and has made it easier and efficient process.


There have been people who have dismissed the buzz words of AI (Artificial Intelligence) and ML (Machine Learning), but software tools powered by AI and ML have been able to make a dent in management industry as well. For some time automation has only affected the workers or the labour intensive tasks, but AI powered software has made many management position redundant. In the service industry, you can already see bigger retailers, either going online or having less and less number of people employed in their stores, with the high penetration of internet, now payments have become increasingly cashless and you can see stores with self checkout counters in the west. You shouldnt be surprised if in the future you enter a mall early morning to get your groceries and you end up being the only person in the whole mall, since every task now has been automated. 


The major industry that is yet to be affected by this onslaught of automation has been driving, the goods carriers, the taxi drivers and truck drivers, the delivery guy who delivers your Amazon orders or the Swiggy guy who delivers you your food. There is a big chance that over the decade you might see all of them disappear, with self driving cars and trucks, drone delivery for goods becoming a reality, the industry will move quickly and make all of these automated. Atleast, now you can take that extra nap you need in your self driving car when you head out to work or eat your breakfast in it. 


Imagining all of this, must give people a sense of comfort, on how the future will be becoming more convenient, but the fact is that it would come at cost of hundreds of thousands of jobs. While, it is true that newer jobs will be created, there is no doubt that it will never be as many as automation will be replacing. There have been solutions to these suggested such as robot tax which is taxing a company more for more automation, or solutions such as Universal Basic Income which addresses the post automation world where jobs are less and people need to be subsidised for living. While not working does seem like an absurd option, maybe it actually isn't, hobbies can become lifestyle choices, more people can go into sports, with the space exploration in the horizon maybe we can go back to exploration, while this will obviously guarantee that capitalism will make the balance of society uneven where we will have the ultra rich that will have majority of the wealth distributed among a single percent of the population, it will be the job of the future governments, economists and leaders to address these problems.

Note: I made a post about content writing and got a bit of PMs regarding samples, so I just made a Reddit post about it. I'd appreciate your advice and suggestions.

It's truly mind-blowing what OP has suggested.

Basically, this model has been there since 19th century and it was used to discipline kids and make them obedience.There has been no change ever since.Even though literacy rates of the west are higher,the quality of education has made many students drop out because it doesn't promote any creativity or critical thinking.The side effects of this are depression,ADHD and living unproductive life,of course.

What do you think of the solution they suggested?Do you want to add something to solution?

Science/Technology,Need for a change of school culture and the hype around class 10th and 12th board exams,"I am currently a Ph.D. in Biology student at a university in the United States of America. I completed my class 10th in 2006, and my class 12th in 2008. I scored 78.3% and 72% in the aforementioned board exams, respectively. During my school years, I was never a meritorious student. I was rather among the bottom 40-50% of students from my class section academically. However, I worked really hard for my class 10th board exam and was deeply affected by the final percentage I scored. I did pretty well in the mock exams that I used to give at the private tuition center I took to help my academic performance and scored much more than many of friends majority of whom ended up scoring more than 85% in the final board examination.

&#x200B;

Till my class 10th, I studied at a prestigious public school in Delhi. As per the school's rule, a student could only be offered Science, if he/she scored more than 80% in English, Science, and Mathematics combined. My score was 77.7%, and therefore, was offered humanities and commerce. The rule didn't make sense as I scored 94% in Science, and my mathematics scores were always among the top 5-15% of the high scoring students in my section.  Therefore, I changed schools to study Science, and today I am earning a top-most degree in a field in which my school thought I was not a good fit.

&#x200B;

I suffered from depression and lack of confidence before my class 10th. I used to be good at cricket, but I suffered in that as well. My school carried a culture where if you are not good academically, then you are hopeless in other extra-curricular activities as well. I wanted to do academically well in school (prior to my class 10th), but the lack of confidence made it really difficult to come out of the shell and raise myself to glory (yes, being a good student did seem like a glory). I was so terrified that I would be scared to even open my textbooks.

&#x200B;

Not being able to get Science made things worse. I lost even more hope, and this worsened my mental health for my class 12th board exam. I remember praying to score at least more than 60% a night before the results. But, today if I could talk to my younger self, my recommendation would be to not lose hope and enjoy doing what you like. However, I still not sure if the environment that I lived would help. In my school days, I was compelled to feel like an outlaw for being among the bottom 40-50% of students from my class section.

&#x200B;

Recently, an article came out on Hindu, about a mother congratulating her son for scoring 60% in class 10th. She says that she had seen her son struggle to the point of giving up, and therefore, was proud of the final scores he got. In my time, my parents were also in full support of me. So was my father, who had always been strict. My father would never come to the parents-teachers meeting, as I was not up to the standards he expected of me. But, after my class 10th, he was very supportive and backed me at every point possible. Getting this sort of support from this person was huge for me then. He tried his level best to make a case to my school principal as to why I deserve to be a science student for the last two years of schooling. But, I remember walking down the school corridor with my parents trying to make a last attempt to convince my school principal, I met my Geography teacher. She congratulated me sarcastically and ridiculed me (in front of my parents) of how bad of a student I was before. It has been 13 years since that gesture, but the instance is still registered in my memory from word to word.

&#x200B;

Therefore, this makes me wonder, whether how much of a support system would your parents be if you have such teachers and cultures inculcated in schools. At that time, my parent's support didn't help me much. In fact, it made me feel even more horrible for being responsible for letting them go through such tough situations. Manier times. especially I like to believe in my case, low scores in class 10th are due to a stroke of sheer bad luck. But, the impact is grave for a naive 16-year-old.

&#x200B;

The point I am trying to make is that in addition to having a good support system from one's parents, the school's culture of dealing with young students needs to change. Teachers have a big responsibility of training future entrepreneurs, engineers, researchers etc, and therefore need to pay proper regard to a students self-esteem and self-confidence. What might just seem to be a simple comment (and here I don't include the personal issues that teacher might sometime have) the repercussions on the student's mental health might be huge.

&#x200B;

Ironically, I got to know about this below-given news article from the same geography teacher's Facebook post. She was cheering this wonderful mother for her attempt to lift the pressure off the head of her son' young mind. I first felt like commenting directly about the hypocrisy she has shown to me at the least. But, I think I should probably try to let this memory go of my head and move on.

Science/Technology,Advice needed for B-School.,"I am doing a Bsc in Information Technology from a reputed college, placements are decent in our college, last year average was 4.5 lacs and highest was 18 lacs, this sounds pretty good for a college with very low fees but i don't see myself doing something in IT field, i cleared the entrances for VIT,KIIT,SRM,Manipal,COMEDK and few others but i did not join any of them for the very same reason, i was pushed into science by my parents and they were also forcing me to join KIIT(which i still can join) but i convinced them somehow for a Bsc as placements in KIIT were not as tempting as they had expected. I choose Bsc due to it's short duration, cost effectiveness and  curriculum was not much different from engineering if you don't include first year of engineering. 

&#x200B;

It's a relief for me that i only have to study 3 years in Bsc, now coming to the main question, at the end of three years, an MBA seems to me to be the most plausible way of getting out of this mess, my previous academics (10th,12th) are good and i can also score good my graduation.

&#x200B;

TL;DR - Choose Bsc over Btech (don't like either of the two), want to do an mba.

&#x200B;

Now these are my questions :-

1) Does doing a Bsc instead of a Btech will have a negative impact during admission in B-Schools?

2) Are all these great packages that the top B-School pride themselves on are only for IITs/NITs graduates etc? 

3) What would you recommend for a person in a situation like this?

&#x200B;

If not top IIMs, i can surely get in top 10 schools.

&#x200B;

P.S - 1)My parents wanted me to do graduation only in CS,IT or Electronics, i have also cleared few entrances for BBA.

2) Money is not a problem, i'm open to all suggestions.

3) I want to go for a degree just after Bsc and don't want to work."

Science/Technology,Is Indian government just memeing about electric cars?,"I'm pretty heavily into cars so I follow the industry news very regularly.

One news item that makes the round every few months is about Indian government's grand plans to make Indian roads fully-electric.

Read these news stories and you can't help but imagine that in a decade, Indian roads will be utopias where Teslas and Mahindra E2Os will glide silently pass you on their way to a solar powered recharging station.

Some samples:

* [India plans to have seven million EVs by 2020](https://mercomindia.com/india-plans-deploy-seven-million-electric-vehicles-2020/)

* [India to sell only EVs by 2030](https://www.timesnownews.com/business-economy/industry/article/only-electric-vehicles-to-be-sold-after-2030-in-india-niti-aayog/438731)

* [Only electric two-wheelers to be sold in India by 2025](https://www.news18.com/news/auto/bjp-led-nda-government-mulling-to-sell-only-electric-2w-3w-in-india-2023-onwards-2171395.html)


Is the government just memeing? As everyone knows, India has no viable EVs in the market. The only electric four-wheeler is the aforementioned E2O (which Mahindra discontinued). All the other EVs on the market are either e-rickshaws or shitty Chinese scootys.

To add to that, there is no charger network. None whatsoever.

Against the target of 70,00,000 EVs by 2020, India has met just 1/10th of that by 2019. Worse, the number of four-wheeled EVs sold in 2019 was a mind-boggling 3,600. [source](https://www.autocarindia.com/car-news/ev-sales-in-india-cross-75-lakh-mark-in-fy2019-412542)

China has shown that with concentrated action, you can do a lot to promote EVs. The country promoted EVs aggressively in 2009 and within a decade, has the world's largest EV market.

Moreover, within a decade, nearly 6% of passenger cars in China are electric.

Meanwhile, India is poised to reach the 5% EV penetration target...in 2030 [source](https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/indian-car-scene/210483-kotak-merely-5-indian-cars-will-electric-2030-a-3.html)

How on earth does India plan to achieve its lofty EV goals? Given the precarious nature of our environment and the horrible air quality in our metros, shouldn't promoting EVs be a priority? 

Yet all I keep reading are meme-tier news stories with nothing in the way of concrete subsidies for EV and charging network manufacturers."

Science/Technology,My thoughts regarding pubg addiction,"Guys pls read full comment and then comment if u think I am wrong and feel free to reply


- Who am I?

I am M 18, A pubg player who used to play pubg for like 4 hours a day from season 1 ( A few days after the game was launched ). U may say I was addicted to pubg.

- Do I still play pubg?

Yes I still do play pubg. But not everyday. I play it very less than before. I only play if my friend msg me if we should play pubg at a particular time. If both of us are free at same time and willing to play then we play else no one plays ( or plays for like 10 mins )

- How did I reduce my time spent on pubg?

1. Glitch and bugs like 1 tap glitch and car glitch and lag in general made me feel that I should not play

2. My friends also felt the same. I used to play most games with my friends because I felt playing with random wasn't as much fun. So we all started to play less


- Why do people commit suicide?

Firstly we are notified of serious incidents like suicide / murder but ""pubg"" should have also destroyed many relationships/ friendships

Personally I do not think that pubg alone can lead to such sad incidents.
The person had no one to speak freely with. No one would listen. Maybe peer pressure made him frustrated. Maybe parents instead of helping, taunted the child. Maybe the society made fun of the person. All the saturated anger/depression was the actual reason. Maybe the person thought that the way the escape everyday boring life was playing and playing pubg.

- Is playing online games to take our anger good?

Yes as well as no. You may feel good after you scream at usually random people but you may also feel more frustrated if they all are against you and u aren't so good in game. In such cases it is a very bad choice

- Have I faced similar situation and what did I do?

Yes even I play online games to take out my anger and sometimes get even more angry.
I just quit the game and start watching some anime I like ( sports anime works the best for me ). Going out for playing or short walks or talking with friends or playing with pets should be better options but many times we can't do it. People should find what works best for them and do it and relax


- Are parents responsible for such incidents?

I can't directly say if someone is responsible.
But parents should help the child. 


- My suggestions to parents:

1. Please don't bring the topic about how the current generation is addicted to phones and pubg and u were like �� x better. It irratates and makes all of us angry. Because ur generation has ruined every single thing. Most of us don't have land to play. Many are forced to compete for marks even when they aren't ready. Ur generation invented phone. School/College and tuition leave very less time to just chill and enjoy.
2. Talk to children like a friend
3. If you notice significant change then pls ask someone for help"

Science/Technology,In need of input from Chemistry enthusiasts !,"I have a good idea for building a company which requires a laboratory for testing water and food samples for heavy metals , pesticides, insecticides contamination. I would like to discuss it with people who have reasonable lab experience in such procedures. If you are well versed with material analysis , your knowledge will be of great help and if you're looking for an opportunity to do something new with the skills you have , this is it ! 

I have a good understanding of how the market works , what the supply/demand rhetoric is , I have had reasonable success in the past in implementing ideas but this project is larger than anything I've done before. Through this company I want to improve the living conditions and standards of everyone in general. So , I want a partner(s) who can tell me about the requirements and necessities of running a analytical laboratory.

As the main driving force for me is , as long as I can test for the purity of water , food , etc I can determine why these essentials are contaminated and how to improve the quality or find less harmful alternatives. The first step to solving a problem is acknowledging there is a problem to start with. The vegetables and fruits we eat are laden with heavy metals , ripening agents , excess fertilizers , pesticides which we unknowingly consume on a daily basis. It is a very big problem throughout india , but it's a hidden problem because theres no concrete way to factually check for contaminants. Let's face it government testing facilities couldn't care less as long as they keep their jobs."

Science/Technology,Will the conflict between India and Pakistan ever come to an end?,"Will peace ever prevail between these two countries?

Since 1947, both countries have been fighting with each other over the issues like kashmir and have fought 4 bloody wars with each other wasting billions of dollars fighting with each other while the people in both countries are suffering because of poverty.

It only seems to getting worse whether it be some terrorist attacks from Pakistan or the stupid kashmir move done by the BJP govt. and increasing the unrest in that place.

Religious extremism is destroying both countries. Both countries seem to be obsessed with religion rather than prosperity and progress.

Imagine if both countries actually focused on development and progress rather than thinking of destroying each other.

Combined population of both the countries is about 1.6 Billion(160 crores) which is about one-fifth or 20% of human population. However more than a quarter of this population is illitrate and both of these countries are very backward when it comes to education, science and technology progress.

Imagine if both of these countries focused on investing in education, healthcare, building economic infrastructure, empowerment of women, increasing literacy rates to 100%, improved their education systems, focusing on economic development, building scientific among the population through proper education rather than fighting over Kashmir out of which nothing was gained, it only lead to deaths of thousands of soldiers of both countries and the suffering of people in Kashmir.

It would be so better if this one-fifth population also contributed to progress of humanity and utilized it's potential.

I'd like to see humanity become a Type 1 civilisation and this means contribution from this one-fifth of humanity is also important."

Science/Technology,Kota District Collector's letter to the parents of IIT aspirants [NP],"Dear Parents,

On behalf of Kota City, I take this opportunity to welcome your child to a city of wonders which processes the young minds of this country and fuels their passion to become the architects of Modern India.

My humble request at the beginning of this letter is to read this with some patience and time and it would be ideal if both the parents can read this together.

It is the dream of every parent to see his child touch the pinnacles of success and reach places which only few can afford. Every parent plants a seed in the mind of the child which over a period of time bears fruits but after careful nourishment and tendering since the seed is so tender that any mishandling may fail us from realizing our dream.

It is a very difficult situation for parents to leave their child in a place where they do not live and things become still difficult when the purpose for which the child is left behind is for dedicated and committed efforts in scaling excellence in education.

When parents look at the huge billboard signage/hoarding/ newspaper clips depicting pictures of young beautiful children who have achieved what they dream for their child, the resolution to inspire and motivate their children becomes still stronger.

Good career in the field of Engineering & Medicine, as the case may be, is more or less like certain insurance in terms of decent earning and living standards. I sincerely think that in most of the cases, this is the very reason that makes us dream such careers for our children.

There is nothing wrong in thinking on a certain kind of Assured Career Insurance for one’s child since limited resources and high degree of competition demands one to think ahead of times.

However, I think we all agree that the world too has changed drastically in the last 15-20 years so much so, that most of the facilities and services that were available for a limited few are now available to many due to the huge progress in technology which was witnessed in this period.

Art, Entertainment, Professional Sports, Literature, Health & Fitness, Entrepreneurship, Journalism, Photography, Event management, Music, Adventure, Destination tourism, etc, to name a few too witnessed immense growth in comparison to the bygone era.

Many of these even created a new niche which not just nurtured creative potential of the human mind and its capabilities but also were very successful career options.

Well, the point is not about asking you to see them as better options but certainly to see them also as options.

It is a matter of fact that today, young children are facing immense amount of pressure relating to their academic performance and due to the same many of them go through various levels of stress.

Even if we consider that a certain element of stress would exist in competition parental support, care and the right kind of family situations would help the child to cope with any difficult situation.

However, current reality is that due to the lack of right kind of conditions and support systems, many children are going through stress uncared and unattended for and in a few cases such situations disabled the children to such an extreme extent that they committed suicide…

Don’t get frightened suddenly as to what is being said about your child… Your child is perfectly safe and sound and you have no reasons to worry, but you have reasons to have concern of your child which I believe you will understand as we read my letter further.

I consider myself a very unfortunate person because I got a chance to read around 20-25 Suicide Notes of Young, Brilliant, Beautiful and Wonderful Children.

Am I giving so many adjectives to such children because they committed Suicide?

I am sorry. Answer is No… They were in fact, as I said earlier, Young, Brilliant, Beautiful and Wonderful Children.

A Girl with an amazing command of English language in her suicide note (grammatically perfect 5-page Suicide Note with beautiful running handwriting) thanks her mother for giving up her career for raising the children… Subtle hint that she was pricked on this matter again and again.

Another girl wants her grandmother to become her mother in her next birth. Another requests her parents to allow her younger sister to do what she likes and not what they like. One tells candidly that he was manipulated to study science which was not his taste. Many simply write in fewer lines that they could not fulfil the expectations of their parents. Rather few say they were not really capable of doing what is being asked for by them.

All of them thought that Death was a much peaceful and effortless action than going through this dilemma of artificially doing what parents want them to do.

As they say “Tip of the Iceberg” reveals little and hides mountains within, similarly apparent Suicide Cases reflect numbers but reality or the hidden mountain is all those children who did not opt to take this extreme step but certainly are going through stress/worry/anxiety due to pressure on performance.

Many Parents cannot believe after the disaster that it was their own child who took such a drastic measure and I don’t mean to hurt their sentiments any further but the reality is that the child was mentally looking for some blade of grass which a drowning man searches for. That blade of grass could have been your simple appreciation of his efforts… your solacing words of comforts of asking him to do his best and forget the results your absolute unconditioned appreciation of his extraordinariness.

In return, what the child got was threats of performing still better…psychological manipulation by repeat and re-telecasting of the hardships you have gone through for the sake of family. comparison with better performers (neighbors, relatives, children of colleague, ancestors…could be anyone) sharing imagination on the loss/notional gain of social status being dependent on child’ s performance.

We need to understand that statistically speaking not many children commit suicide in comparison to the total number of children coping with such academic pressure if we analyze the numbers but life analysis tells us that their hopes and dreams are overlooked and hurt many a times. So it is high time we pause and contemplate a bit. I need to take a pause here since I hear many of you saying kids do not like many things which are good for them. So the question I tend to hear from you is… Should parents go childrenâ€™s immature ways? Not necessarily.

Well let us try to see what all good things they resisted… Eating right, sleeping right, talking right, behaving right, seeing right, listening right, reading right etc.

Child actually observes parents and never follows anything blindly. Moreover, there is one thing which is certain… Child analyses and looks at the parents to see whether in case any of those things preached are followed by parents to begin with and if so..Whether their parents are really loving, joyful, peaceful and happy by doing so.

They tend to pick up only those habits of their parents that make them happy and peaceful…In case you have seriously messed up situations, your child may even not like you.

It may appear strange and extremely annoying… But there is a possibility of your child not liking you… This comes in many forms and shades. Absolute dislike, not liking few traits of yours, not liking you by comparing you with someone better, not liking you for your over protective care and concern which you may think as love but is suffocating for the child, not liking you for your double standards (we may have…) etc.

So, is it the objective of this letter to make you realise that your child dislikes you?

Answer again is a big No.. Your child does not dislike you… I am just making a point that unconsciously we may have created such a situation, which we need to undo…

Children are parents’ responsibility and we are no one to teach a parent their responsibility nor do we intend to do so… Parents really think good for their children’s future but the point I need to make is that your dreams are always limited to your experience of what is good… what is successful… what is the best thing… Well, the truth is your child may surpass your imagination and reach places which you never even dreamed of…

We all come from different segments of the society in terms of social & economic status, culture, religion, belief systems etc. However as far the natural principle of upbringing a child is concerned they remain the same everywhere.

I am not an expert in Parenting nor have many credentials in “Right Child Care Practices” and I fully understand that different kind of children need different kind of interventions yet I would request you to divert little attention to these fundamental aspects relating to child management.

Creating the right kind of atmosphere for the child to grow and flower in home by making home a really happy, loving and peaceful place to live.
Understanding the needs of the children. There are two extremes in this case…Making the child go through terrible hardships to realise “Your” dreams is one end and the other end is over-pampered care… Both of them definitely do not work.

Take time to switch from teaching mode to learning mode from the child since children show you the way to be really happy and peaceful at times…Instead of learning form them we tend to always assume the role of teacher/preacher.

Allow the child “to be” on his own terms and here I mean especially the child’s engagement with nature and world around and empower them with the right kind of communication skills which are more accommodative. Interaction with the other gender due to their coming of age is not an aberration but a normal process, which you can keep a note on but not try to prevent it totally.

Spend time with children without complaining of your office, life situation, problems, hardships all the timeâ€¦. It may be really too late before you want to spend and there is no more time available with the child. Why? Because we may have made him just like ourselves in an effort to tutor him. We certainly are not the benchmark for the child. Many a times, we may be regressive rudimentary types in comparison to the ability of the child.

Just a final thought. Are we interested in making the child realise “Your Dreams” at any cost or should it be like creating such situations that the child realises “His/Her” Dreams?

I could have simply attended a Parents Counselling Session during admission and spoken on these issues but usually it so happens that in such gatherings we are conditioned and influenced more by impression of the person sitting next to you or people who think different.

Nothing wrong in disagreeing but it is best to disagree on own terms instead of getting influenced by others. Finally, I would like to tender my unconditional apology for taking your time and telling you things about Child Management in which I am no expert and my words in this letter have been gathered by my limited experience in Kota dealing with similar cases and certainly there are great men who have inspired me to put my thoughts before you.

Be the Best Parent in the World!!!!
I am sure there is no competition there

Science/Technology,We really need to talk about Flairs.,"Hello /r/india  
  
Here are some clarifications on submission flairs, since we see a lot of mis-flaired posts from time to time.  
  
**[P] - Political**  
  
These are for political posts only. If a post involved any politician, political party or anything primarily related to politics, then it must be flaired as political  
  
**[NP] - Non-political**  
  
These are for discussions where you are confident there is no politics involved. You cannot flair a post that is primarily or tangentially related to politics with an NP tag.  
 
This is important because quite a few people use the filters we have on the sidebar to filter out political (or non-political) posts, and misflairing one as the other may irritate these users.  
  
**[R] - Reddiquette**  
  
When this flair is selected, Reddit's Reddiquette guidelines are enforced in the thread, along with certain other restrictions so as to have a slightly higher quality discussion.    
  
Jokes, puns and low effort comments will be removed in such threads.
  
This can be used for both political and non-political topics.  
  
**[ASK] - AskIndia**  
  
These are flairs for self-posts where the OP wants to ask the community a question. You cannot use this flair for link posts (because that makes no sense unless ToI or HT wants to ask /r/india a question).  
  
If the question is political in nature, then the thread must be flaired with P or R, not with AskIndia. This is to prevent filters from being breached.  
  
**Science & Technology** 

This flair is for topics with an explicit, mostly non-political science & technology bent to it. If it tangentially involves politics, it is fine to use this flair in place of [P].   
 
If Modi makes a comment about the ISRO, then it is a P thread.  
If the ISRO conducts some research that points to where state governments can improve with irrigation, and a politician comments on that, then it can be flaired with Science & Technology assuming the primary focus of the story isn't the politician's comment.  

**Policy & Economy**
  
These flairs work similarly. The main topic of the subject matter should be about policy or economy. The instant the focus shifts to politics, political parties, politicians, etc. the flair must be [P].  

**Business & Finance**  

These flairs are for articles, or self-post submissions with a non-political, business bent to them. If you want to know where to invest or if Ola Cabs decides to go public, then this is the flair for you.  
  
**Entertainment** 

Entertainment flair is exclusively for pop-culture links, submissions, and discussions. Examples under this flair include movie trailers, movie clips, comics, YouTube joke sketches and things along those lines.  
  
This flair cannot be used for some politician saying something absurd, funny or ridiculous. That constitutes an editorialization of the title on the part of the OP - since the OP insinuates that the subject matter is funny with the title (instead of letting the reader make up their mind).   
 
**Sports and Food** 

Sports & Food flairs are very self-explanatory  

**AMA**
  
AMA flairs are given to OPs who verify their identity with the mod team. In case they choose not to verify, they will get an **Unverified** flair.  
  
**In-Depth**

This flair must be used carefully.This flair *only* used when you need an In-depth discussion about the topic. Top comments must have a proper explanation/discussion about the top. Top comments must fulfil the word limit else the comment **will** get deleted by all mighty automod.

---  
PS - In the event of confusion, just go for Reddiquette.
  
Recommendations for new flairs may be made below.  "

Science/Technology,This Indian Automaker Wants To Revolutionize eMobility In India: Here's How,
Science/Technology,[Serious] Seeking advice from r/India since most other places have foreigners who can not give proper answer,"Hello,

I am someone who wanted to do research for a living, physics specifically, but because of various circumstances was forced to do a bachelors degree in electronics and communications engineering in India. I had previously been in a markedly Western system and could not cope but was forced to finish the degree anyway. It took me 7 years to finish with reappear papers piling up over and over again and I am now 25 years old with a low undergraduate gpa (6.122/10). I am still interested in research but I don't know where to go now. I was hoping to do research in physics (and I still am) but after some discussions I may have to change things up a bit.

I've discussed a bit about what I've heard from reddit with my parents. As far as things go financially, I am pretty dependent on them. Now from the way the discussion went down last time, I get the feeling that they might be getting impatient what with me taking so long on my bachelor's already and from what they are letting on, I should either get into a program already or get a job soon. No preparation for exams or anything unless it is going to take 2-3 months or less. I don't know if that is enough time even if I were to study night and day. Besides, shouldn't I gain conceptual/research knowledge?

From the options I have gotten from Reddit, it basically boils down to mostly getting an MSc. I'd rather avoid doing it in India mostly because I am fed up with the educational system. People just learn how to parrot the textbook instead of actually becoming skilled in their chosen field but that may not be an option because of what I did. I pretty much just followed the curriculum. No extra curriculars/research experiences. Any practical laboratory work listed in my transcripts is pretty much on paper too. I mean it's not like I haven't handled a soldering rod, some circuitry, CROs and other small stuff but, then again, who hasn't? One redditor mentioned that because of this it may be easier to do MSc in India first, get research experience and attempting post baccalaureate courses to beef up my resume, then going abroad but as mentioned before, there is the issue of what my parents will and will not allow.

The problem comes due to the intervening periods. It doesn't help that my parents despite trying to act progressive are still limited by traditional thinking. I can't exactly blame them what with money being a relatively limited resource in our family and time passing by but that is not exactly helping with my long term plans. Due to this, theoretically, I cannot take the time off to prepare for exams for the universities such as JNU's physics MSc entrance exam or something nor will I be able to work on the post baccalaureate courses since they will take time AND money. Practically, I would probably have to work to find a job and as long as I don't find a job, I would keep preparing for the exams and what not but then I have to juggle that with trying to keep up with the knowledge required for the job that they will obviously test, if not outright rejecting me based on my grades, in some prelim exam and/or the interview. That or get a clerical job but I don't know if even that is possible because of the burgeoning population.

Now my first question to you guys is if some of the following fields might be easier to pursue research in. They may be somewhat related to both my bachelor's field as well as physics and I do have interest in them. I am not asking you guys to advise me about any of them but I am putting this out in case any of you know if it would be easier for me to go into research currently in any of those fields. Anyway, the fields are:

1. Quantum information science (computing, information theory, etc.) - Our field did involve conventional computing and information theory

2. Quantum devices/electronics, though I don't really much like the sound of this. I didn't realize there was a particular distinction between conventional electronics and quantum electronics. To my knowledge, standard electronics are based on our understanding of QM phenomena.

3. Photonics - Study of optical phenomena and derivative technologies such as optical waveguides, splitters, couplers, etc., was also focused on somewhat in my field

4. Photovoltaics/Renewable Energy Research in general - Photovoltaics is probably more the focus here. I put the second part there to emphasize my intention with research in it as well as tangential research interests.

5. Condensed Matter physics. This is more general than electronics so I don't expect it to be easier but just in case...

6. Physics of computers/information - not sure about this since it seems like it could fall into information theory

7. Dynamic systems theory (control theory, chaos theory, quantum chaos, etc.)/Study of Complex Systems - Our branch did have a lot to do with (mathematically) modelling various systems in many different ways, observing the effect of various inputs and feedbacks on the outputs.

My second question to everybody is, how would I accomodate my constraints, financial constraints being of particular note? Basically, I have to get into a program but seeing as that may be very unlikely, I may have to get a job instead. But I don't know if I can get anything other than a sub par clerical job with my degree and grades and I am not sure that would help me further my long term plans. To sum up, I am really confused about the next step to take. Please advise."

**Edit** - Added short descriptions to some podcasts, will continue to do as and when I get to know more. Also, some names are self-explanatory, so would not be describing them.

**Edit 2** - **I thought that was the complete list when I first published it, but I keep on stumbling on new ones. So, please stay tuned and keep checking the list. I""ll be updating it more frequently.**

**Edit 3** - For those who are new to podcasting world, To get things going I have added some podcasts app links that in my opinion are good and would serve well to both new and advance users to get a hang of it.

**Edit 4** - Added a counter on Top, so we will all know how many podcasts have been discovered.

Please feel free to add to this thread if you have any suggestions to this list. If you know of an Indian podcast and would like me to include in this list, just leave a comment below and I would be happy to add to the list.

Many months back, I came across this [interview](http://www.rediff.com/news/interview/aatish-taseer-india-is-semi-literate-and-chetan-bhagat-is-the-best-it-can-do/20150205.htm) with Aatish Taseer, where he calls India a ""semi-literate"" country. I was quite baffled then, by his words. Why would someone with such deep connections to India make such a disparaging comment on its citizens? Its true significance has finally hit me and it's making me sad.

We're a country of a billion people with few opportunities and deep contrasts. However instead of trying to bridge the divide, mend the fracture and soothe the pain, we keep insisting on magnifying the gap and adding salt to the wounds. 

How did we become so politically incorrect as a nation? How did we let bigotry define us to such a large extent? How did we let education fail us?

As Indians, our single goal as kids has been reduced to clearing entrance exams without realising the kind of studies that we're getting involved in, to get there. We're not broadening our minds to ideas, we're not enhancing our understanding of ourselves, we're not experimenting with out of the box ideas on science and technology. No. As 15-16 year old kids, we're solving questions. Recognising patterns. Trying to understand the examiner's psyche in order to get the most questions correct, sometimes spending months and even years in those hallowed halls they call coaching institutes. If you manage to set aside all the hoopla around coaching institutions, they're merely *cram schools*. Even our neighbouring China has them. But we as kids, and more importantly our parents, don't want to be told of that. Because deep down, that term *cram school* conflicts with our idea of what education should be all about. I, like many millions, was also a victim of this. Yes, I made it though. But I'm under no illusion about exactly what I've achieved. I've crammed and smarted my way through entrance exams by recognising patterns and understanding ""important concepts"" without ever learning to think for myself.

And then the results are in front of us to see. This [video](https://youtu.be/Rfw5nQy5_pw) popped up on the front page of my YouTube yesterday and I ended up watching it. One of the kids here appears to be incredibly cocky about what he thinks of people who weren't able to qualify for IIT. I don't blame the guy, maybe a few years back I'd have behaved the same way. But he exposes how limited our understanding is, of education. Our entrance exams, be it medical or engineering, are tough *because* we have such a huge population. That and because the number of institutions of repute (even though the IITs don't even rank among the very best institutes in the world) in this country is embarrassingly minuscule. 

College education is a similar tragedy. Teachers merely teach. Students merely attend classes. Teachers get promoted after a few years, students graduate every year. The teachers have no incentive to teach, they don't get promoted because of the performance of their students, they don't get recognition for using exemplary methods of teaching. And yet they expect students to do well, grasp concepts and become contributors to the society, magically. Our respect for teachers in this country runs deep. Unfortunately, that blinds us to the gross callousness with which most of them do their *jobs*. As a result, we graduate not as informed educated citizens, capable of engaging with a wide range of people on a variety of topics, but as robots. Robots capable of working efficiently, without having the ability to position us in the grand scheme of things, without having the ability to question and without having a worldview. 

But enough about institutional education. What about how we think? Do we even know *how* to think? Are we tolerant enough and respectful enough to differences of opinion? Are we accommodative enough? Do we know our history? Do we know who we are as a country? 

In the comments section of the same video I shared, you'll see many plainly abusive comments about SC STs made without realising how bigoted they sound. The hatred for the lower castes is clear. The hatred, often, isn't even about reservations. It's about a group of people who we think don't deserve to be where they are, or more specifically, where they are being allowed to go. How oblivious, how shallow and how deeply rotten do we have to be, to pick on the weakest section of the society, the SC STs?

The tragedy is not that we are bigots. The tragedy is how we *fail to recognise* how bigoted we are. The tragedy is not that we are inherently casteist as a society. The tragedy is that we constantly *fail to recognise* how casteist we are as a society. 

This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ1EgsRT1zk), an interview by Ravish Kumar of an African student, exposes just how limited our understanding is of race. He is referred to as a ""gorilla"" in nowhere else but the capital city of the country. How can we as a nation, as a colonised nation in the past, not empathise with Africans? How can we be racist to a group of people who were treated the same way as we were by colonial powers of the day? In other words, how deeply has our education system failed us, that we have lost the ability to recognise our shared history?

If you go through comments on Twitter (and no I don't mean just the hateful comments directed towards a particular group of people), you'll realise how incredibly easy we find ourselves to be insensitive, even when we're not hiding under the hood of anonymity. An Indian woman, from a religious minority, was rescued by the government from a foreign country, in an astonishing attempt that brought out in me a deep sense of respect for government officers and diplomats. And then I read disparaging comments about her family on Twitter on the same day, by religious nut jobs. Add to that the hegemony, a certain group of people hold in our society, and the whole thing becomes scary. 

Bigotry and hatred, borne out of ignorance and pure cluelessness, have become a disease. And I will not even mention Facebook here because that is a cesspool of hideous ideas. Even some of my friends and colleagues, who I've known for a long time, have in many cases become absolute hypocrites, espousing hatred towards the disadvantaged and more importantly, towards the *different*. It's not about conflicting ideas of conservatism and liberalism. Its not even about the right and the left. It's about basic decency and having a semblance of understanding about our position as Indians in the world.

I do not excuse myself of this prejudice, of course. Having become a product of this system, I've also become a victim of the same kind of regressive thought processes that haunt many. May we all strive to, at least, *recognise* this, and if possible, mend our ways. 

We deserve better compatriots. Our children deserve better peers. And most importantly, this country deserves better citizens.

**Childhood in my Hood, Spider-Man and INS DEGA**

As you can see, I am from Vizag. I was brought up and still live in the middle of an Industrial-Estate. My entire childhood revolved around [all sort of machines]( https://imgur.com/a/EdN3Xvj), machinery and welding sparks coming from the never ending fabrication works that went on in the hood. This sort of environment made me a naturally curious kid thanks to my dad and Uncle who both hold a Diploma in Mechanical Engineer for choosing the right neighbourhood. All my questions regarding these machines were nicely answered by my father and that in turn made me more interested in how things worked. This got a boost when I first met [*Spider-Man* and his amazing friends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0FJNBRP8P0). This show and other Sider-Man shows had a huge impact on me, so much so that I used to play with common house spiders in hopes that its bite would turn me into a Spider-Man. Thanks to Universe, venomous spiders are not that common in a typical Urban Indian household I guess, I’m still alive and well. Besides that stupidity, Spider-Man being a student of science and using science to solve problems or for fighting villains made me interested in sciences and I started to pay attention in classes and made me question and think about things in universe and nature. This helped me have good foundation in Maths and General Sciences. 

On the other hand, our neighbourhood is in the close vicinity of a Naval Airport, INS DEGA. This helped me develop a love for things that fly. Our Neighbourhood used to be perfectly aligned with the runway path of the airport, this gave me really up close view of the planes touching down and taking off of the airport. Being a Defense airport there were special aircrafts in addition to the commercial ones. Navy Week was and still is the best season for some flight watching. At the age of 11, this interest in flying things pushed me to apply the science I learnt in school to make an object that fly with the help of DC motors it failed, of course. But that failure has set the path which I would follow in my higher studies. My father introduced me to A.P.J. Abdul Kalam who has been a huge inspiration. I may not know the name of the degree but I decided to study the science of flight and how to build things that fly. That was the idea of a child. 

**Finding an admission for Undergrad, IITM- Shaastra 07 & 08, Job Hunt & Masters in UK**

I was good theoretically but competitive exams are not my thing. I knew, I wouldn’t succeed neither in JEE nor AIEEE so any dreams of doing Aerospace/Aeronautical Engineering were smashed, my parents are kind enough to not force me into that machinery and left me to my choice for EAMCET. I just have to get a Mechanical Engineering seat in Andhra University or GITAM. That’s good enough for me because, Mechanical engineering also covers the science of flight and these two are the best engineering schools of my city and I don’t have to leave town if got an admit. 

So I found myself in GITAM, it has been a fun ride there. I always loved hands on jobs since I am a kid. I love to build something or do something with my hands. In second year of undergrad I attended Shaastra’ 07 at IIT MADRAS and it changed my outlook on engineering as a whole. I was awed by the students who built and gave a demo of the [VTOL flight built by them, Team YU-FLY?]( https://imgur.com/a/jj7DiUk) It was the coolest thing I saw. It was when I started taking an interest in research and technological developments in my field and in general. Target was set to Shaastra 08, me and my childhood friends made a contraption built by our own hands using a lot of Jugaad and tools found from the hood. Have a look here [GIF 1]( https://gfycat.com/KnobbyCompetentBear), [GIF 2]( https://gfycat.com/ImperturbableDefenselessIberianmidwifetoad). That was the demo video we sent in with the abstract. We are the Mighty mavericks but we got of Lots of weak links in the plan and it worked only partially. This set the stage for my participation in a series of technical events that I would attend over the last two years of my Undergrad. 

My communication skills were really bad by the end of Undergrad and this meant I wasn’t doing good in the Campus Interviews. I only wanted to join a core company and I couldn’t find any. I did the 5 day assessment for technical engineer post in IAF but didn’t make that list too. Couldn’t get a good rank in GATE. But found myself an admission at a really good Mechanical Engineering School in UK. Education Loan was the only way I could afford this and my parents had to put our house on the line to get a loan. EDWISE has given me immigration support free of cost as I secured my own admission. Went to UK and finished my degree, visited London twice and returned home. That’s it. I did not make much contact with the life in UK, its land and its culture. I was limited by time and money. But with the help of High-speed internet, I did learn a lot about world, science and technology, history and was introduced to reddit, student guilds, game of thrones and a whole lot of popular culture through university life. This helped with my English and subsequently my communication skills.

**Shock after returning home**

After finishing the degree, I returned home only to find that the degree I just received is not valid in India. Even a private engineering college didn’t want to hire me as a lecturer because my degree is not considered a Master’s Degree. That was a huge blow to me. I had to look for opportunities abroad again. Thanks to my thesis supervisor in UK, a well-known name in his field, gave me a good recommendation letter which helped me secure a full scholarship to do doctoral research in Australia. I was so happy and my parents were really proud of me.

**My way Down Under and How life changed there: RA Job, Research and Cooking**

I never thought I’d end up in Australia of all places. I went there with no expectations and the first few months have been the most difficult months. Then I made friends at student housing, who pushed me to apply for RA position and that changed a lot of things. I got the position and during my term I would be promoted to a senior RA and would organize the best parties and events over the next couple of years. This gave me a huge exposure to Aussie, International students and cultures from around the world. I had to be outgoing for the job so I became an outgoing person. [My love for cooking, adventure, camping and off road driving]( https://imgur.com/a/w6k2kIk) helped me go to some of the remote parts of Australia and make some amazing friends along the way. People around me at uni and housing were mostly younger than me, were not judgemental at all and I could do what I want without fear of judgement. I was earning good money while having the best time of my life and cleared my education loan in no time. [Perfect song to describe my time down under](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpjvJdomfM) 

My research on the other hand was not going as expected. I am a hands-on person and I always enjoyed experimental work rather than simulations or numerical work. My research problem has been changed by supervisor from being heavily based on experiments to one that was half cooked right from the beginning which consisted mostly of Numerical work and only some namesake validation by experimental work. On top of that one of supervisor who is supposed to help me with Numerical work has moved to another university in another country all together and I was left with a supervisor who is Experimental guy guiding me on numerical work. From there it was a downward spiral and I ended up losing interest in the research I was doing. I produced two papers which in my opinion are not really great. 

On a parallel, I was doing really well as a RA, was cooking and trying some amazing recipes to whole lot of people from around the world and at one point [I cooked Indian food entirely made from scratch for the entire student village of 300 students](https://imgur.com/a/NqswIa9). Since I was a kid, I loved cooking and it was a life-long dream to own a restaurant someday and this idea was there in the back of my head all the time. And when it came to point where I can no longer continue my research work due to various reasons and I had to make a decision to change my line of work. It wasn’t easy, I had to consider so many things into account and had to find the confidence that I can cook commercially. 

**First Job in a Commercial Kitchen and How I found myself in a Road trip**

So I went searching for a job in a commercial Kitchen. After a lot of failed attempts, I went door to door along a popular coffee strip giving out [my new culinary resume](https://imgur.com/a/xVMIt9s) which I had to make up using the things I did so far. I got a call back from a Chef who loved my resume, my passion for the craft of cooking and gave me a job in his kitchen. Being the only computer literate among the staff I got to know the ropes of making stock lists, recipe cards, the numbers behind making a menu and running a commercial kitchen basically /r/kitchenconfidential. This gave me the confidence I needed. 

I rented a big motorcycle above 700CC which I always wanted to drive and just left for a drive. I covered 1400 KM in next two days along the southwest corner of Australia. This journey gave me the opportunity be with myself, think about myself and helped me come to a decision on so many things I wanted to do in life. The trip was really dangerous, I was driving 130-120 KMPH because I only rented the bike for two days and wanted to make the most out of it, I cannot lose sight of the road ahead because if I hit a kangaroo or things crossing the roads I’d crash at high speed and before I know it I’d be dead as Australia being so huge it would take hours for someone to notice me or get me to help. This fear for life made me so vigilant, self-aware and made me concentrate on the road like I never did before and that too hours on end. I was a different person at the end of this trip. I am not even exaggerating on this one. I felt like I conquered all my fears in life.

It was clear to me; I just had to do what makes me happy. I quit my research, quit the job in the kitchen and was finally on my way back home with the most daunting task ahead,  telling my parents about it, convincing them to help me start a Food Truck and to believe in my dream. After all is said and done, they still don’t get why I am doing this but decided to support my cause. 

**My Friend**

I could not do this alone; I needed a partner to do this with. The first person I got in mind was my lifelong friend. We went to same school since kindergarten and grew up together in the same neighbourhood and in a way we see thing uniquely in our own ways. He was not a brilliant student in class but he was the best when it comes to real world, he is creative, he can see things which no one else can in places nobody else even looks. He is brave and always helped me with my phobia for dogs; he has been a huge support in my life. I spoke to him regarding this and he immediately wanted to join me. He quit his job in Mumbai and came back to our city. He has his share of troubles at home, more than me and for that I really admire him for believing in my dream and to make this decision to join me on this journey.  

**Straight Outta Vizag**
	
I named our little venture Straight Outta Vizag because I truly believe this city has shaped my life so much, in a way it defines me and for that I love my city like how Peter Parker loves his city, New York. Although we are not the webbed vigilante we too try to do some good in our city. For our first socio-event, thanks to my sister and Good Universe, a NGO, [we organised an awareness campaign on women’s health in our neighbourhood](https://imgur.com/a/uKaRy2d) and it was a grand success. 

We started operations with this [Menu](https://imgur.com/a/WIlbGXU) and was getting a  good response. Then, Kerala floods happened so we decided to donate our earnings during this run towards the Kerala flood relief activities as you can see from our post history.

**Cold hands of the City governing bodies**

No matter how good our intentions are, we are not welcomed in the city. Before going on road, we went to various government offices like, Food safety and standards, Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation- GVMC and its Public Health wing, City Police and Fire Department to get permission according to this [Notification by Hyderabad City Police](http://www.ctp.gov.in/PressNote/NotificationFoodCourtVehiclePermission.pdf), I found online. It appears so that, none of the people I met have no idea if such a regulation existed in my City, Vizag. No one official has given us direction with this regard. No one has responded to us properly, most of the people claim that no one has come to them like us, asking permission to put up a food truck and that they won’t allow it, mostly because they haven’t done that before. But there are lot of food trucks running in the city. 

[I submitted a letter to the Commissioner, GVMC]( https://imgur.com/a/F0jGspG) in May but got no response even after all these months so we started operations with only a FSSAI license in hand. Where ever we go Police or the GVMC personnel has asked us to remove the truck. Why are other trucks allowed then? Later I learned that other food truck people formed into Unions area-wise and are running things according to their made up rules within the area like a “dhandha”. Why do I have to join a union of a particular place or all the places if I intend to set-up my truck?

**More Social Activism**

During the month of August 2018, we had rains for a couple of days and our street got flooded due to improper storm drains. We have had this issue for ages and our colony people have approached the municipality but nothing was done. In lieu of this, we brought it to the notice of [GVMC commissioner through an open letter](https://imgur.com/a/F0jGspG) on our facebook and twitter profiles, which talks not just about our problems in the hood but also other problems that I have seen in my city. This time we got a response but I did not mention my problems with the permits because it didn’t seem right to plug the same with problems in the hood and my city. 

GVMC responded promptly and started the restoration of storm drain works in September and finished the work during the second week of November. Due to these works happening we had to put a comma to our operations and resumed our work during third week of November. 

**What happened after we are back on road…**

This time we wanted to try a healthy breakfast menu and we set up shop on the way between VUDA Park and YSR statue Roundabout on the beach road. We were asked to vacate the place by an Assistant City Planning officer from GVMC Zone II. The next day we moved to parking in front of YMCA on beach road and two days later, this time, a sanitation inspector warns us not to put up the truck and it will be seized if we do so again. So we removed the truck and went to meet the GVMC Zone-II commissioner, Mr. Palli Nallanayya. Here’s how our interaction went by: 

Me n My friend walk into commissioner’s room who appeared to be in a staff meeting. 

Me – ‘trying to hand him the letter we already submitted to GVMC’-- utters the words: “Sir, memu food truck okati start chesam mee...” “Sir, we are starting a food truck…”
He cut me off there and with a growing frown on his face he just utters the word “ivvamu”... “Alantivi ivvamu ma zone Lo” “Stop it there, we will not give you a permit. We don’t do this sort of thing in our Zone.”

Looking at his body language and the way he didn’t even bother to hear what we have to say made me sick and we left the room. 

Because of these obstacles we are now without a proper location for our truck. Many have suggested me ways to get a contact in GVMC who knows “how to get things done” But I do not want to go that route because it is not the right way to do it and as stupid as I am I will fight for what is right and we are planning to meet the commissioner regarding this and File a RTI with GVMC and City Police regarding what they know about already existing food trucks. Meanwhile, we found some gigs with adventure agencies and started arranging food for trekking and camping events in our beautiful and untapped eastern ghats.  We also cater to small parties, family gatherings, speciality events, college get-togethers and many more. We met some amazing people along the way, particularly youngsters who seem to respect and admire what we are trying to do which in turn gave us energy to continue on our journey. We intend to bring cooking and the joy of making food closer to our patrons and give them a well-rounded dining experience wherever they choose to eat.  

Our city has so much to offer in terms of tourism. Our tourism potential is not fully tapped into and we want to promote our city tourism which will help create jobs in the local communities. I cordially invite any and all off you folks that love a good beach or a view from a hill, come visit our city, Vizag. If you choose to hire us we can take you around and accompany you with good food and present you with some amazing views that are unique to our city and it’s geography. As the songs goes... [Say hey, good lookin' - what ya got cookin'? How's about cookin' somethin' up with me?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjCoKslQOEs)


I’m sharing this with the reddit community because it is a unique platform compared to other social networking sites and the people, stories from reddit have inspired me a lot and helped me develop as person. And by sharing this I would like inform the community about us and hope that our story may inspire someone else in realizing their own dreams. Also, to reach out to a lot of people who barely know about our City in terms of a travel destination and to reach out artists, content creators, travel bloggers and to collaborate with anyone who is interested in enjoying good food and nature. Do have a look at us, know about us and if possible inform your friends about us. See you on the road. Meanwhile here’s [some pics of our truck, menus we did and of places you can visit in and around Vizag.](https://imgur.com/a/lAHV5Xj)

Ever since BJP has come to power, there has been systemic destruction of the nation's education system.  
Apart from few fancy Pradan Mantri Yojana's I honestly don't think BJP has done anything to improve the education system of the country. The latest attack of masked goons in JNU shows the condition of the Indian education system.   
Moreover, top BJP leader's have continuously attacked science and made unscientific statements in public trying to undermine rationality and scientific thinking.

> The BJP-led central governmenthas aggressively pursued the policies of commercialisation, centralisation and communalisation of education.

However, at the same time it is destroying the federal character of Indian education and is attempting to control the entire sector from the Centre, as part of the designs to push the Hindutva agenda. This is reflected in appointing RSS personnel in key administrative bodies, rewriting of history, abrupt and irrational changes in syllabi, propagation of pseudoscience, so on and so forth. The brunt of these attacks is falling upon the students from the socio-economically exploited and oppressed section.

Science/Technology,A neophyte analysis between Russian Chernobyl and Indian Bhopal disasters: TIL a chemical leak from a pesticide plant in India killed and injured more people than Chernobyl,"In the intervening night of 02 - 03.12.1984, around 40 tons of methyl isocyanate gas (MIC) accidentally leaked into the air from a pesticide plant managed by Union Carbide Corporation (now owned by Dow Chemicals), engulfing surrounding slum areas and suffocating tens and thousands. “Children, women, old men dying and dead on the roads. Carcasses of dogs, cats, chickens, goats, buffaloes, cows, birds lay everywhere,” read a New York Times article published a week after the incident.

**The direct cause of the Bhopal gas leak is attributed to the presence of water in a tank containing liquid methyl isocyanate (MIC)**. Liquid MIC is a chemical intermediate meant for the production of pesticide Sevin. Now, this chemical is stored in underground tanks under cool temperature and optimum pressure. Large amount of water enters tank no.610 on the night of December 2, 1984. This tank contained atleast 40 tonnes of MIC, more than the safety rules permitted. A run-away reaction begins which is speeded up by contaminants (iron residues from corroding pipelines). The mixing generates major increase in temp/pressure forcing the venting of toxic fumes.

Like Chernobyl, the Bhopal disaster was a man-made nightmare, with scientific &amp; investigative reports pointing to negligence, government oversight, managerial defects and state-level maladministration.

**Chernobyl/Bhopal**
Neither did scientists and Soviet leaders at Chernobyl nor did Indian authorities and officials of the multinational corporation anticipate such levels of catastrophe. The worst thing, though, in both the cases, was the risk management. Poor crisis response aggravated the situation and inflicted damages that could have been averted or at least mitigated.

**Parallels between Chernobyl and Bhopal**

Both occurred in the 1980s with an eighteen-month gap between them.

Both accidents unfolded at mid-night during night-shift sessions.

Although both resulted in explosions (A nuclear reactor detonates in Europe while in South Asia, a large storage tank of chemicals blew out of its concrete chamber following an uncontrolled reaction with water), Chernobyl’s ‘immediate’ death toll was lower compared to Bhopal where thousands perished.

The two tragedies were blamed on ‘operator error’ and led to the arrest and prosecution of individuals.

The Chernobyl Atomic Energy Station and the Union Carbide India Limited (UCIL) pesticide plant were constructed in relatively backward regions. Soviet Ukraine was a largely agrarian economy. **Madhya Pradesh was one of the least developed areas in India at the time. The state launched incentive schemes to attract factories and companies. Rapid industrialization invited large group of people, workers and migrants looking for jobs; many settled close to the factory. **During 1983-1984, the local government approved sanctions to let residents stay in these localities.

HOT (Human, Organisational and Technological) analysis reveals that administrative and managerial weaknesses contributed significantly to both accidents. In the case of Chernobyl, experiments similar to the routine maintenance test which led to the nuclear meltdown had been carried out before. The technical factors that caused the toxic leak at Bhopal had been identified previously but never fixed. In 1981, three years before the debacle, seepage of phosgene gas (component of methyl isocyanate) killed one of three employees assigned to shut it down. It was understood the person took off his gas mask in a contaminated area. At least 4 more leaks were recorded until 1982. **Safety lapses and minor mishaps were common occurrences at the Union Carbide factory.**

Workers broke safety rules because of organisational pressures. The need to generate electricity and meet the demands at Chernobyl pushed employees to skip regulations. Commercial pressure dictated events at Bhopal as the company cut back on safety provisions and maintenance practices as profit margins plunged.

Fundamental design flaws existed in both the plants, such as the ‘jumper line’ in the pipework at Bhopal that led to the entry of water to the MIC storage tank, and the positive void coefficient at Chernobyl RBMK reactors which led to a positive power coefficient (sudden power surge) at low power outputs. 

Operators had access, and were allowed, to disable key safety equipment, contributing to the accidents. While there was considerable component failure at Bhopal (the failure of the pressure valve of tank no.610), there was no apparent component failure at all at Chernobyl. Around 26 November 1984 (a week before the catastrophe), a Union Carbide employee tried to move 42 tonnes of liquid MIC from one of the three storage tanks to the processing unit. Though nitrogen was sent in to enable the transfer, tank no. 610 failed to get pressurized. This was a sign of leak.

Both accidents were exacerbated by managerial failure, information dearth and system related errors. The refrigeration unit meant to keep liquid MIC cool under 10-15°C was **shut down**. The vent gas scrubber, installed to neutralise the poisonous gas in case of a leak, was put in **passive mode**. A pipe leading to the flare tower, capable of burning remaining gases going from the vent gas scrubber, was **disconnected.** The alarm siren was **switched off** immediately after starting it and only restarted once the leak became severe.

Poor perception of severity of risk compounded workers’ problems. In 1985, one year after the incident, many of the workers were interviewed. According to a Times report, almost all the workers said they knew methyl isocyanate (MIC) was dangerous and some said they knew it could be fatal, but a dozen workers said they underestimated its toxicity. No one said they knew it could kill many people quickly.

Both accidents resulted in extreme, life-threatening health problems. Victims of Chernobyl suffered from nuclear exposure of varying degree from mild maladies to ionising radiation. The effects on Bhopal gas victims were far-reaching and some, still unfolding - **blindness, cancer, birth defects, depleting fertility rates, respiratory disorders, intellectual disability, body deformities, environmental contaminants like lead, mercury in breast milk of nursing women, babies born with fused bones and holes in heart.** One survivor is quoted as saying, “Those who escaped with their lives are the unlucky ones – the lucky ones are those who died on that night.” 

The Bhopal factory lacked quality instrumentation. (The pressure indicator control and level indicator of the MIC tank and the temperature indicator alarm were faulty for a long time. The instructions in English were not comprehensible for the operators. The initial practice of employing degree holders and imparting 6-month training slowly caved-in. Some among the workers were high school graduates). The Chernobyl station, by contrast, was considered a fine specimen of the Soviet system’s flagship technology. The employees, who were highly-trained and well-paid by the country’s standards, felt confident that no major accident was possible and thus, did not hesitate to ignore instructions.

**The 1984 poisonous gas leak in central India, to this date, remains the world’s deadliest industrial disaster.** 3,787 deaths were confirmed by the state of Madhya Pradesh. In 2010, in a curative petition filed in the Supreme Court, the central government sought compensation for ‘5,295 deaths’. However, activists claim 25,000 people died so far as a direct result of the disaster and the continuous chemical trial left behind.

We will never know the true extent of Chernobyl’s damage and death toll. It's been 33 years and yet, the exact scale of human sacrifice and the number of displaced remains a secret and a much-debated topic. Around 600,000 liquidators (many among them affected) from around the Soviet Union were sent in to assist with the prolonged containment procedures. Between 1986 and 2000, a total of 350,000 people were displaced with the exponential extension of the exclusion zone. It is said that deaths range anywhere between 4,000 to 93,000 over the years. A Belarusian study estimates total cancer deaths at 115,000, in contrast to the World Health Organisation’s tally of 9,000. **The Soviet Union’s official death toll is listed as 31.**

Science/Technology,To Redditors of Kolkata,"It's not the buildings, the roads, the bridges & other concrete that make a city what it is, but the people inhabiting it. Hence, my dearest peers, knowing this city to be their home, lend me your ears.

These are dark times that we're going through. Violence. Oppression. Racism. You name it and it's what we experience, ad nauseam. Change is needed. We need it — we demand it; and this being the season of ballot boxes & EVMs, we yearn to vote to that end. 'Tis here, I beg to differ and ask: is it really a considerable choice when we're given to choose our predators, between lions, tigers and wolves? Yes, one of them is way worse than the others & needs to be gone for everyone's good; but is empowering the other murderers any better?

For as long as I remember, our lives have been spent as slaves & serfs to these powers: the fools, bigots & goons, called politicians we elect into leaders, the banks, capitalists & industrialists we sell ourselves to and to each other, caught in their barbaric game of tag, in which we're all 'it' in the end. I want to change all of that; don't you?

They say, everything big, starts small. Hence, in a world of 7.6 billion, would it be too wrong to start with our city of 14 million, prided so much for its openness, liberalism & intellegentia? Kolkata is OUR CITY: OUR COMMONS, OUR HOME, enclosed by bigots & greedy gluttons to have created a graveyard for our dreams and for life, especially for the thousands who pour into it everyday, hoping to obtain the collectively acknowledged fictional oxygen, called money, required of us all to exist. This is no longer a city, but a corporate heath, bearing concrete in place of vegetation.

I yearn of you, hence, let's not set aside our differences on who we wish to elect, which fiction we wish to pray to and so on, but evolve our minds to move beyond such gibberish and actually work to make this city sustainable, homely, liveable, post partisanism, post market, post capitalist and really smart, not just a dumb city with proprietary wifi, that the oligarchs deem smart. Let us build, on this pyre of yesterdays' failures, a new city that truly would shower joy on all.

Considering today's problems, my wish is to take back the city into our collective hands, as our commons, manage it so, and make it thrive, not grow exponentially. Of course, when I say take back, I don't ask for a violent revolution of the ploretariat, but establishment of mutual-aid-networks & P2P Commoning practices, with each of our houses, condos, etc. being its reliable nodes. It is impossible to build such a space using current structures, such as the market (a network where people paywall goods & services to exploit each other & accumulate capital) or the state, with its systemic biases of race, religion, etc., the NGO circus standing on Corporate Social Responsibility Grants, acting as band-aids distributed by those that machine gun us, and other top-down, vertical (hierarchical) institutions. Therefore let's start here, as the Kolkata Commons Collective, a mutual-aid-network, where we organize ourselves horizontally, as equals, and work hard to produce, maintain and common the commons for us all to enjoy.

In case you think my beliefs to be Utopian and my ideas too lofty, the same was & still is thought of the knowledge commons: Wikipedia, the numerous thriving Wikis, Free & Open Source Software, especially Linux, which powers apart from the desktops of a few of us, the entire internet, all supercomputers, most phones (Android, Sailfish, Tizen), Open Source Hardware such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, RISC V, the Wikispeed car, FOSMC bike, 3D Printers, Open Designs, Creative Commons works, Theatre Commons grouups, Cities like Seoul, Barcelona, Brussels, etc., the hackerspaces & real makerspaces (anarchist, non-profit, commons oriented ones, unlike the corporate, for-profit open washes of science museums & technical schools) coming up around the world, etc., and many more. The big question is, whether we continue our banal, servile, practically cannibalistic ways, being skeptical of our capabilities, or pitch in to prove the market-worshiping, orthodox, skeptics wrong, to liberate ourselves and eveyone else?

[Here's a nice introduction to the Commons](https://youtu.be/nsRFdBBOyzU?t=155).

After that of course, let us please network & work! Here are some of my proposals — a list to which you're more than welcome to add, via comments maybe.

Proposals:—

* Localizing our physical, economic circuits to reduce the ecological footprint & make the city resilient to calamities, both natural & artificial. The media may be glorifying Orissa on its disaster management, since Fani hit, but let's remember that huge sectors of the state are still dead, without electricity, water, etc. since being dependent on a centralized power grid system, they've no recourse but wait for the long electrical and other circuits to be connected again become functional again.
* So noting the above, creating, improving & sharing our own version of [Open Source Ecology](http://opensourceecology.org/)'s [Global Village Construction Set](https://www.opensourceecology.org/gvcs/gvcs-machine-index/), and establishing a network of [Hackerspaces](https://hackerspaces.org/) to start manufacturing [Glocally](http://commonstransition.org/what-is-p2p-an-introduction/) (doing the light things globally and the heavy things locally), to aid us.
* Running a web of [SOLEs (Self Organized Learning Environments)](https://www.theschoolinthecloud.org/) to aid our education.
* Creating a distributed internet based on meshnet technology, using the [ESP8266](http://esp8266.net/) and similar Open Source Wireless microchips, protocols like [LoRaWAN](https://lora-alliance.org/about-lorawan) like systems, etc., to free our dependence on centralized, paid, private connection providers  we use to access the WWW and communicate. So think distributed web with [IPFS](http://ipfs.io/) & [dat](https://datproject.org/) protocols, along with garlic routed, P2P VoIP, accessible & managed as a common, without any central authority or monetary barriers.
* Manufacturing & distribution of basic phones similar to the [WiPhone](http://a.wiphone.io/), to inhabitants who require it, and much, much later, a fully Open Source, [RISC V](https://riscv.org/) based smartphone running [Android ROM](https://source.android.com/)s or [GNU/Linux distros](https://itsfoss.com/open-source-alternatives-android/) with touch friendly UIs.
* Establishing a real, public transport system using car-sharing algorithms (Real Sharing and not Uber/Ola/Lyft/.../'s share washed micro-lending economy) to share the leftover seating & storage spaces on our existing Cars, converting our petrol & diesel drinkers to sustainable, local sources, such as electric, via renewables like solar, wind, hydro, etc., collecting, scavenging & hacking the abandonned vehicles, lying on randomly on roads, especially around Police Stations to aid these ventures, producing, distributing & evolving the [WikiSpeed](http://wikispeed.org/), [OSCAR](http://www.theoscarproject.org/), [OpenMotors](https://www.openmotors.co/)' [Tabby](https://www.openmotors.co/tabbyevo/), [FOSMC](https://www.fictiv.com/blog/fosmc), & other platforms, and connecting them as a Transport Commons for everyone to enjoy.
* Running networks of [submersiles](https://www.openrov.com/), [solar powered](https://solarimpulse.com/), [lightweight](http://ligeti-stratos.com/index.html) [aircraft](http://makerplane.org/) & [low altitude satellite systems](https://libre.space/), to physically reach greater distances without having to go through state regulations and corporate pay walling.
* Establishing distributed power-grids, using solar, wind and other available, sustainable technology, to escape our dependence on the Power Corps.
* Movement to Open Source platforms, as opposed to proprietary, private ones to remove our dependence on Corps. For instance, moving from MS Windows, Apple Mac OS X, etc. to GNU/Linux distros, FreeBSD forks, etc.
* Nurturing Open Source Communities, to voluntarily labour to help develop the global Open Source pool and other Commons
* Creating a [network](https://farm.bot/) of Vertical Farms, Aeroponic Gardens, Aquaponic Greenhouses, and so on to [produce](http://farmhack.org/tools) Food Commons for us all, networking into a post-market, moneyless ecosystem using the [Open Food Network](https://openfoodnetwork.org/).
* Creating a network of sustainable [water](http://www.freewat.eu/) cycles to provide potable, [fresh water commons](http://openwaterfoundation.org/).
* Providing universal healthcare as a commons, producing [Open Source medicines](http://www.opensourcepharma.net/) & [medical equipment](https://hackaday.com/2018/01/30/making-the-case-for-open-source-medical-devices/), in our mesh of [bio-hackerspaces](https://biohack.me/), [while also](http://openbci.com/) [extending our human bodies](https://openprosthetics.org/)' capabilities through transhumanist practices and sustaining a thriving grinding (biohacking) culture in the city.
* Hacking our prodigal buildings to make them [more comfortable, effective & efficient](https://www.openbuildinginstitute.org/), connecting everything with DiY Open Source IoT systems.
* Nurturing a thriving pro-science, DiY, hacker/maker culture in our city along with aiding education in STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts & Mathematics) and the humanities in their advanced forms ... the list goes on.
* And finally, scaling to the suburbs and villages of West Bengal, and even other cities in other states, connecting Kolkata to the global commons movement, and making ourselves visible on the global map, to help liberate the world."

Science/Technology,[Rant] I'm seriously tired of this is so called education,"This is mostly your weekly education rant, nothing new. Throwaway account since I'd like to stay anonymous and wanted to let my thoughts out in the open.

A bit about me first. I loved computers from a pretty young age but at the time I simply loved it as a hobby. I also remember the young me reading tons of books on topics like space and nature. The only thing I was good at my middle school was Physics and Computer Science but kinda ignored all the other subjects. I also loved helping other students with these subjects to the extent teachers would point out to me with ""stop being so noisy"" and ""get back to your seat"" kind of synonyms. I was pretty open to the future wondering what it held for me. Anyway, I decided to pick up Engineering.

Everything has been going in a downward spiral since then. As any typical kid in India trying to get into a good Engineering college, I went to these so called JEE coaching classes. These places were so horrible. Over time, I realised that these coaching classes are simply forcing down material onto their students. If there was some actual learning happening in there, given the vast syllabus, it wouldn't be so surprising whenever a high school kid from India marked an innovation in science. Rather we see students killing themselves for not being able to score good marks in the examination. There is such an intense pressure on kids since you're constantly being told that not making into a good college equates to no woman marrying you and you're going to be working an awful job, if not jobless. In short, your life is going to become so fucked up that we see kids already making peace with death instead. And then out there are some fucking assholes who feel that this is helping in reducing the population of our country by weeding out the unworthy. Just stop making kids at the rate you shit, fuckheads. Instead of making a positive effect in the country, these coaching centres asking for a shitload of money are simply saturating the already saturated field of Engineering in India. Some parents also force their kids to these coaching centres just because of their faculty flaunting their achievements as if they are a God's gift to this world. Anyway, these coaching centres are just a symptom of the core problem of how most reputed colleges in India accept students solely on the basis of one or two examinations and how colleges like to be seduced into being an AICTE approved college. This whole education thing has turned into fucking business.

I failed my JEE since I couldn't keep up. The failure doesn't hurt me, partially because it is my way of rejecting this system. I've come to a realisation that I cannot learn things solely by books and paper, I need to experience it in reality, or I cannot digest anything. Which is why I was probably good in and loved Physics and Computer Science. It costs virtually nothing to see things in motion and see that the equations really do match up, and write computer programs to do stuff for you and everything makes sense. The thing is that doing everything in such a way consumes a lot of time, but I feel it is worth it. It's extremely hard to work on all the high school concepts here and look out for their real world significance at the same time, all when the examinations are pretty much all formulae and rote based.

Anyway, I joined a tier-3 college hoping to at least make it nice in Computer Science since all you need is a Computer to experience anything. But oh lord fuck this place. Just so you know, I spent my high school years learning to program by writing small scripts to manipulate my environment and eventually, I started working with other people to make open-source software. So all this helped me get into GSoC in my very first year of college and worked with some genuine people working hard to make a positive impact to this world. If not for GSoC, I'd also have been forced to attend the ""summer training"" to ""learn HTML &amp; CSS"" along with other students in the college itself, where the students are kept idle for like half the session and you know what all restrictions they put on even when you are idle - no phones, no YouTube, no heads down for taking a break, no talking to other students (seriously?!). I had another friend of mine who did GSoC in the 2nd year but you know what, students were supposed to ""attend a training institute"" by paying the institute money during this summer break but apparently his GSoC wasn't considered since it was seen as an online course (as opposed to going and attending a training institute) by our Head of Department. So, rejected. Poor guy still had to pay a private institute for his forged training certificate despite of working so hard and lie that he worked on both his training and his GSoC project.

I'll talk about some more wonders here. Our college has so called Soft Skills sessions where instead of learning how to communicate properly with other people, you are simply taught how to flaunt and bluff every little thing to everyone and speak hollow words to ""impress"" other people (since in the end, this college only cares about to headline the highest number of placements offered in the Limca Book of Records). Rather than receiving proper technical knowledge, we spend time practising aptitude questions. Many students here have difficulty communicating, structuring grammar and forming sentences in simple English due to their unfortunate backgrounds and yet no work is ever done to help those students become proficient. It's been 3 semesters since we've been studying about Software Engineering and Software Testing to learn the craft of creating and maintain a software, and literally not a single fucking line of code yet! Most students still believe all that there is to testing a software is looking for bugs by hand. There hasn't even been a mention of automated tests and sort till date and I am 3 years in. And, if the authorities find any students good in solving aptitude questions, they are going to differentiate them by making them solve CodeChef problems in extra classes as if remaining students are merely a possession to the college for the time.

We are assigned to work on a team project every semester and are evaluated by professors who have no experience in the said technology the project is based on. These professors then end up judging students by asking standardised definitions from the desired technology in the final viva instead of actually evaluating by asking project specific questions. No wonder the majority of students steal from GitHub or copy-paste projects from their peers, no one cares. Also, the assignment questions are so blunt with hardly any thinking involved, you can look them up and boom you get full marks if you submitted it on time. Now, I could keep listing whatever the hell is wrong here: Minimum attendance: 75% or no exams for you. Students are forced to stay seated and their heads up even if the concerned subject teacher is on leave and the substitute teacher has nothing to teach about. Internet/WiFi is censored by some company called FortiGuard, anyway the Internet hardly works here. Can't eat, roam or leave the campus before 12 noon. Worst of all, there are students who have been so brainwashed that they blindly trust the authorities just because they believe the faculty is truly full of professionals and are the ones who can help them get a job if they keep repeating their words. We aren't really learning anything here of actual use.

I don't even know whether this is the situation for most colleges in India or I just happen to be in one.

Now here is me who helps with some really nice open-source projects, writes technical posts trying my best not to repeat what the Internet already knows, fighting censorship, trying to help my peers and random internet people with anything technical whenever possible, just because I like to care about people.  All this when college eats up my 9+ hours (including commute) everyday, I really feel like a fucking idiot now. What am I even doing. I don't even want to bother with money or be a rich man, just enough to feed myself or if a family happens someday. This shit has been so sickening lately that I've started doubting that it's just me who the real asshole here is."

Science/Technology,What is the Future of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in INDIA?," 

A news report published in October in The Economic Times said, “Start-ups witness 108% growth in funding in India in 2018.” The news report further mentioned that Artificial Intelligence was among those domains which witnessed the fastest adoption among industry sectors. **Currently, there are about 400 start-ups working on AI and machine learning domains. About $150 million dollars is invested in India’s AI sector by private players alone and the number has been growing since 2016**. Though there has been growth, India lags far behind countries like the US and China in terms of investment. With a copious pool of STEM talent and with a growing population of youngsters, India will be banking on AI for its economic growth and improvement in the quality of life of its citizens.

There are several start-ups that are based in cities such as Bengaluru, New Delhi, Mumbai and Hyderabad which work on artificial intelligence principles to serve consumers better. Their product range varies from multi-lingual chatbots to online shopping assistance and automated consumer data analysis

* **THE ROAD AHEAD**

The National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence which was put together by the government of India through NITI Aayog sets the roadmap on how to develop AI in the country. The report points out how AI will help the country grow, what are the strengths and what are the challenges on the way. The government has identified a few areas where it thinks AI will play a crucial role as far as India is concerned

 

Capital and qualified manpower are the two main pillars that are required for the establishment and growth of any sector. India is home to a large talent pool of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math graduates. Companies such as Google, Intel and Microsoft have been offering short term training programs to computer program developers which help them upskill in the area of AI programming. On the other hand AICTE, the government body which governs and regulates professional education in India, recently added AI, IoT, Machine Learning and few other subjects as mandatory subjects in its curriculum of B.Tech programs. Changes in curriculum and content are further expected in the days to come.

Investment towards AI from private players has been increasing in India ($44 million in 2016 to $77 million in 2017). The start-ups have been working towards developing various AI-based products and services. With conglomerates having a lion’s share in India’s market, there is huge scope for AI-based enterprise solutions in the country. The increasing demand for products and services can attract more investment towards R&amp;D in AI sector

Science/Technology,Custom Firmware on Jio GigaFiber Router,"I left Jio Gigafiber and I have the FTTH router with me but it has modified firmware by Jio which blocks using services from any other ISP. Is it possible to install a custom firmware on this router as I have read online that there are custom firmware built for routers for many reasons and developing one for this will be helpful as it’s a good looking and sturdy router with decent range and there are many people like me who have not got their money back so I plan on using this router with another service provider. 

Why I left JioGigafiber?

I got the Jio GigaFiber after giving into the hype of Refundable Deposit &amp; Free High Speed Internet Services until the services are made public. After a week, I started facing issues in the services mainly pertaining to Internet Speed which was not stable, it  used to fluctuate between 15-65 Mbps with 2-3 days of very slow &amp; unstable internet almost every week, which sounds decent for a free trial subscription but is not worth replacing main internet connection service. Anyway, after complaining about it to the Jio Team and asking for the Refundable deposit back, it’s been over 45 days - which is the stipulated time to receive my money back, I have not yet got a single penny and so I decided to use the FTTH router."
Science/Technology,Redmi Note 7 Pro vs Realme X,"**Realme X:** 4+128: 17k | ~~8+128: 20k~~ (I cannot afford this)

**Redmi Note 7 Pro:** 4+64: 14k | 6+64: 15k | 6+128: 17k

**My use:** A couple of messaging apps, a social media app, e-mails, light web browsing, sometimes Kindle app, a lot of music, some video playback, a few other apps. No gaming.

**My top priority question:** Considering advancement in Android (memory footprint of newer apps, power/RAM-management features of newer Android versions), is 4 GB RAM enough in this era?

**Other things to consider:**

* Camera: Undecided - I don't take many pics but it is important. AFAIK both have the same sensor but how is post-processing? I do not care about selfies.
* Audio: Realme X - I saw that Realme has Dolby Atmos so kinda leaning towards it
* Screen: Realme X - I have never used anything with a notch so far so I'm not sure how I'm going to feel about notch of RN7P.
* Battery: Realme X - RN7P has a bigger battery but RX has a fast charger in-box.
* SoC: I don't care as long as it gives fluid experience.
* \*add something if there is anything else to consider\*

So in the end, I am stuck because of the camera and the topic of memory requirement/management. Help me with it!

Did I pick the correct device in the rest of the categories?

Considering Vivo Z1 Pro on the side. It has a much bigger battery with 18 W charger &amp; a newer SoC. However, I cannot stand micro-USB &amp; I'm unsure about its camera from various reviews. But let me know if you think its pros outweigh the effing micro-USB (I don't know why I hate it!!).

Or is there any upcoming phone within my price range (around 15k)?

I was very interested in upcoming Mi A3 but 720p AMOLED is painful. I had smaller AMOLED screens and over 5 inches it was okay at best. 6 inches is meh.

I have checked several Samsung phones, and I have decided against them for various reasons (VFM, past experience). Still, if you have a strong recommendation for a Samsung phone let me know.

Thanks!"

Science/Technology,Pride and Prejudice,"I was having a beer while reading a book in the cafeteria in Deutsches Museum. A middle aged couple sat next to me. The lady said, ""Hello"".
""Hello"", I replied. The gentleman joined in, ""Studying in Munich?""
""No. Working"", I said. 
""Where you are from?""
""India"", I said. 
""Oh we are also originally from India. We live in USA. 20 years. Came here to visit our daughter and our grandchildren. We are originally from this city of that state in India"". I smiled and nodded and started speaking to them about that city in that state in India because I also lived there for 7 years. He started saying how much he misses his city and his country, being 20 long years in USA. I smiled and listened although I wanted to return to my book. Here I was sitting surrounded by the statues of Planck, Heisenberg, Einstein, Leibnitz and hundreds of scientists and mathematicians, the descriptions and depictions of their work in one of the best technical museums of the world containing hundreds of machines of the past, computers, ships, aircrafts, telescopes and what not and suddenly the gentleman said, ""No matter what one says, we are far ahead than them"". I was puzzled. ""What are we talking about?""

The man said, ""In shastra it is written - Everything comes from water and fire. Have you read Veda?"" and then he unfurled a shloka from Veda. I was quite amused. He then continued, ""Our Munis and Rishis have written everything about nuclear physics 5000 years back"". I interjected, ""That I would not know but I think that the contributions of the likes of Ramanujan, Bose, Raman and Chandrasekhar were enormous"". He skirted those names and said, ""I am an engineer. I have to tell you that India is at least 1000 years ahead than any country in science. One has to read Veda"" and then he fired another sloka. His wife was not getting impressed just as I was not making much sense of the sudden outpouring of Sanatan sentiments. 

I realised that it was better to move. But then he did not stop, ""You see it is a matter of what I call perspective. We knew thousands of years back what scientists here are knowing now. Chemistry, atomic physics, space everything we knew. At that time Europe was what? A dark continent. They knew nothing. We invented Zero, you know that?"" 

This is when I lost it. I asked him, ""Sir, you miss your city and your food and friends. That is quite understandable. But I do not understand why you have spent 20 years in USA and your daughter is married in Munich while you miss your country so much and you cannot stop praising it. Why don't you go and live in India? I also do not understand why you are even here when you should be in India digging Vedic spacecrafts. Why do you come to a Science and Technology museum in Germany to claim superiority on others' achievements? Indeed one can take the Indian out of India but one cannot take the India out of the Indian.""

His wife tugged at his arm before things escalated because I guess he was about to throw another salvo of slokas. They got up and left. I was left with a bitter taste in my mouth. It is not the ignorance that hurts so much, it is the misplaced pride that left me dumbfound and sick in my guts. "

Science/Technology,A criticism of the New Education Policy 2019 and existent education policies,"**Problems with respect to HECI and fee fixation :**  One of the biggest problems that the policy has done, is that it has legitimized the policy of state exit and buttressed the belief of Private Education providing Quality education. **HEFA, as has been founded by GoI in association with Canara Bank and has  a corpus of 1 lakh crore of which centre is paying only 8500 crores, puts this whole thing into perspective. The rest of the corpus is to be attained via loans, which has to be repaid by institutes over period of time. Now, indirectly asking, on whom will the institutes push over this liability of 90,000 crores? Its the students, and the pricing of courses**. While Fee fixation and allowing autonomy is welcome to an extent, but let us not fool ourselves, any HEI with half decent infra would need a fuckton of expenditure and the money has to be absorbed from the peoples pockets

&#x200B;

**A blueprint towards privatisation of Higher education.** Not a word has been spoken about Quality Assurance or the fact of Accountability fixation towards Private institutes. ASSOCHAM reports that 93% of the MBAs in our country is unemployable. ( [https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/featurephilia/story/mba-education-problems-328626-2016-07-11](https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/featurephilia/story/mba-education-problems-328626-2016-07-11) ) Now lets get into this quandary. We want to privatise education without a semblance of accountability towards them really providing people quality skill upgradation. Let us look into the average unemployability, the Private college Engineer stands much worse in employability situation than the average NIT/JU/BESU (and am not even taking the better NITs and IITs and IIScs into picture). **THE WHOLE DOCUMENT PROMISES US LAVISH WORDS, MUCH PROMOTION, BUT IT SPEAKS ZILCH ABOUT WHERE THE FUNDS ARE GOING TO BE RAISED FROM. In the previous year we had seen how the INSTITUTE OF EMINENCE tag was given to JIO institute. This meant that they could raise a massive 1000 crores for over 10 years , but we all know the project never even begun, how can we judge its credibility and potential. The government did away 1000 crore clause for private institutes temporarily, but there has not been any subsequent clarification on it, thus proving  the** ***crony- corporate- neta - babudom clout*** **is taking over the education system too.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**The Report clearly shows that round about 49% of the children who take up education in Class 1 do not continue it beyond Class 10.**  The policy sort of considers that  this ratio will be maintained, and we should actually place infrastructure in such a fashion that it caters and provides quality care for the 51%. Implicitly it has recognized that the rest of the 49% will not come up, and that there would be more stress towards the 51% who continue than bringing up the 49% who are exiting the net.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Fails to address the biggest issue : EMPLOYABILITY .** Take this in two parts\*\*.\*\*

&#x200B;

**Employability of the lesser skilled :** THE Present Government **SINCE 2015** has been pushing the skilling agenda. Furthermore as has been the priorities of the policy, skilling has been mandated as an important part of the DEP,2019.   It had promoted the PPP model for skilling. But the model as Sharda Prasad report has shown has failed to muster much influence. So much so that 99.5% of the skilling units are government owned. The skilling institutes are marred with **CONFLICT OF INTEREST,** Malgovernance and the credibility of their skilling quality is pretty poor, once we look into the rates of employability after completing the courses. The NSQF framework has adopted a technique of **recognition to prior learning** \- but although the skill of a layman is getting recognized, what is its effective use, if it doesnt lead to any jobs? In the above tone lets also take up the **ISSUE OF SYLLABI in VT and diploma courses. The course structure in VT is haphazard enough with its whole bouquet of courses, preventing streamlining. This means aligning the courses to international requirements, ensuring a basic foundation in the 3Rs, and life-long learning**. It implies national standards for an in-demand skill set with national/global mobility that translates into better jobs. Short duration courses (with no real skills) that provide low pay for suboptimal jobs cannot be called national standards. Hence the current national standards have to drastically improve.   Germany has only 340 courses — in accordance with the National Classification of Occupations 2015 (which itself was based on the International Standard Classification of Occupations). Such trainees will be a national asset. **What we have instead are nearly 10,000 standards, produced mostly by consultants.** There cannot be thousands of standards (compressed into 2,000 qualification packs/job roles), and “delivered” to trainees in a matter of a few months. **This is not what the National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF) had recommended. The focus should be in strengthening reading, writing and arithmetic skills.** No skill development can succeed if most of the workforce lacks the foundation to pick up skills in a fast-changing world. Vocational training must by definition be for a minimum of a year, which includes internship (without which certification is not possible). **Short-term training should be confined to recognising prior learning of informally trained workers who are already working.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Employability of the higher skilled :** The problem of the higher skilled is sufficiently different from that of the lower skilled. Such a situation has happened due to few reasons :

1. promoting a flawed pattern of **EDUCATION FOR JOBS and MARKS**
2. Lack of requisite jobs in the sectors of choice. **Yojana in 2017 had carried out an Important little study where it matched the aspirations of students of HEI to the jobs that were prevalant across the state.** The results were near abysmal, given only few states had above 40% correlation between the jobs they were producing and the jobs that the students were demanding.
3. **Putting in a process of ""Hands On"" education and not  ""Hands free"" education.** While the government has been pushing its cause of making innovation an important part for Ranking HEIs and ranking technical institutes,and brought in a plethora of schemes to Encourage partnerships with such colleges that have a ranking of less than 200 as per QS,  the problems involving the lack of **""Hands On""** education are far more complicated than just that. It involves the problem of RoI on such innovation (credits system), the push towards Quantitative numbers (yes, more the number of papers, and not more the number of papers in journals having high impact factor), the lack of imaginativeness in our educational regime across society, all contributes to the same.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Romanticizing of Sanskrit and the past. Case in point, Bharatiya Shiksha Board.** No, we arent going to become a vishwaguru by promoting cow pee as a cancer cure. No, Bharatiya and vedic shiksha boards can never be equal to CISCE and CBSE. The skill imparted for doing astrology can only get a person to some VHP shakha, sorry it is never going to a man a job to earn a living. Promoting pseudo science in the name of TRADITION is blasphemy.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Mission Nalanda and Mission Taxila has said that there will be Higher Univ in every district,**  but there is no plan in place. The government trying to establish the fact that pushing private people to open and run univs can be good, but that will never be inclusive. **To remember all those who believe this is some new innovative plan of mudiji, the RUSA scheme and its intentions of opening HEIs across all EDUCATIONALLY BACKWARD districts was present since UPA days. The present re-wrapping and calling for the Private sector gives me only a feeling of Skill India 2.0**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**ASER AND NAS reports clearly show the abysmal state of education in our primary levels. There has not been one attempt made to fix the situation,** rather than a vague policy prescription of INTERACTIVE EDUCATION. **Mid day meal and good nutrition might attract and increase the GER at entry level,** but it isnt going to solve the **LEARNING POVERTY GAP ISSUES .** Let us not fool ourselves, a country where the average class 5 to class 8 going child struggles to solve class 2 mathematics, skilling is an useless exercise. OECDs PISA report had ranked us abysmally, so much so that we withdrew participation from PISA and joined it back only this year. Economic Survey 2017 part 1 shows that the learning gap is far greater in girls wrt mathematics. In such a case solutions can be manifold. **Should we create a separate situation for girls, where they feel confident enough to take part in maths and science related activities? Studies have shown that given the Backward Upbringing that a female child often gets, combined with the fact that there is a huge Number of UNWANTED FEMALES ( Computed by metric Sex ratio of Last child) it is only expected that they would feel Underconfident than their fellow male compatriot who has better ACCESS to CARE, NUTRITION at home. The worst part of the report has been, although it has agreed time and over again about the learning poverty gap, it has ONLY PROMOTED SOME COSMETIC MEASURES LIKE FLIPPED LEARNING AND DIGITAL BOARDS.**

&#x200B;

**BRINGING UNIVS UNDER CIVIL SERVICE CONDUCT RULES.** One of the most important places of societal evolution and innovation and invention is the University. The varsity must be kept a free place, where infusion of ideas, permeability and penetration of ideas must be maximum. On the other hand, our government has left no stone unturned to bring the Univs under the ambit of CCS rules. Vide CCS rules ; A professor would not be able to openly criticize and elaborately express his dissent against a government policy in an editorial without having its approval. The problem is not just in bringing Univs under CCS, but a concealed attempt at making SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY and PROGRESS subservient to some whimsical stuff written in Ancient Textbooks. The Indian Science Congress was just a blatant attempt to push its agenda. Such vile attempts are being concealed under norms of **""PROMOTING RESEARCH IN CHOICE SECTORS"" , "" GRANTS FORWARDED TO SUCH RESEARCH THAT IS SOCIALLY VIABLE**""  and such other ambiguous terminology. (Vide schemes like IMPRESS, IMPRINT etc)

&#x200B;

**BRAIN DRAIN AND BRAIN USE .**  A wonderful opportunity lay right infront of our hands to reverse back atleast a section of brain that has been drained. Given the rise of RIGHT in USA and across many European nations, we could actually reverse and bring some of our talented brains back to our country. But for that we need a liberated education system, and a system that is ready to suitably employ such people with due remuneration. Also lets move into the issue of **BRAIN USE.** A very important issue here can be one of **social learning based methods, via ""Interested people"". Can we tap such brains, that are probably voluntarily unemployed, or maybe want a more respectable employment, and try to push them in sectors where they can impart learning to say a TRIBAL school, or maybe the average SSA school, with a honorary compensation**? We have always been crying ""HEY NO TEACHERS AND NO RESOURCE"" while we actually have resources that we arent ready to look into.

**ARE WE TRYING TO BE A GLOBAL LABOUR ECONOMY OR A GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY? The whole policy has been mired with ambiguities, where it speaks of IMPROVED ACCESS, but no QUALITY IMPROVEMENT, where it speaks of ACCESS IMPROVEMENT, but doesnt really proceed to describe how it would finance, and in places where it speaks of FINANCING of HEIs it seems to forgot the margins of difference that exist between a PSU and a Govt funded HEI. Private, for profit  education has never been linked to improved access in areas of low access. What seems further is the deceit by the govt to concede an explicit percentage of society as going to be ""leftovers, since they wont continue education anyways"" , and the deceit by the govt to EXIT in a sustained manner from a section that needed greater govt involvement in the veener of ""PRIVATE EMPOWERMENT"". The push for higher fees with minimal ""restraint"" will only lead to severe EXCLUSION of the lower rungs of the MIDDLE CLASS from the advantages of HEI while buttressing the hold of the upper echelons of the 1% both ""Sociologically and systematically"".**

A total hypocrisy where we speak of inclusive education yet, we believe FOR PROFIT education will push education to the EDUCATIONALLY BACKWARD PLACES. The Vacancies in the biggest and best Institutes wrt FACULTY are being kept vacant intentionally, to show them in poor light, to the public, enabling generous privatization. Rather than being lost in dreams of how digital blackboards and play based education and a 5+3+3+4 education , which are cosmetic reforms to the real problems of POVERTY (in learning) , UNEMPLOYMENT and DEPLORABLE INFRASTRUCTURE.

Science/Technology,"Hi, /r/India! TRAI wants to know how we can hold telecom operators accountable for mobile data speeds. Here's how you can make your voice heard.","Firstly, here is the consultation paper: [Consultation Paper on Data Speed Under Wireless Broadband Plans](http://www.trai.gov.in/sites/default/files/CP_Data_speed_01062017.pdf) [PDF]

###**What is this?**

TRAI wants to know **how mobile Internet providers should be held more accountable for the data speeds they advertise.** Mobile data speeds are much more variable and unpredictable than fixed-line broadband connections, so TRAI is looking at whether they should make a 'label' from telcos mandatory that specifies what kind of speeds customers should expect from their connections. TRAI also wants to know what kind of tech they can use to *measure* how fast telcos' connections actually are for their subscribers.

###**Sounds great! How do I send in my ideas?**

First of all, take a deep breath. Telcos are going to have a really long answer to this consultation, and their lobbying will be polished and elaborate -- they do **not want to be regulated.** If you are a concerned citizen, you need to make your voice *heard*, not just *counted.*

Telecom consultation filings are not rocket science. You can send in a good and insightful response, and it won't take you more than an hour or two. Remember, your response **will be read**, and this TRAI administration leans towards consumers. 

**Read the consultation paper.** [Here's the link again](http://www.trai.gov.in/sites/default/files/CP_Data_speed_01062017.pdf). Read it fully, it's only 30 pages long, and gives you enough context and information to be able to answer the questions.

**Draft a response.** This should not take you very long. You have a month to send a response in, so just spend a couple days collating all the points you want to mention in your response, order them under subheads, and work them into your answers to each question.

Make a PDF or Word Document of your response and email it to **kapilhanda@trai.gov.in**.

###**Cool! What's the deadline?**

The deadline is **29th June**. You can email TRAI and ask them to extend this deadline if you feel that this time is not adequate, and they usually do extend deadlines upon request. But try and get in on this right as telcos do, because TRAI may read responses as and when they ge them.

The deadline for **counter-comments**, which is an ***equally important stage***, if not more, where you have to counter arguments made by other responders, is **13th July**. 

###**What are the questions?**

Here are the questions TRAI wants you to answer. (emphasis all mine; text slightly edited for clarity). If you feel like you don't know the context for some of these questions, check the consultation paper; it will probably answer any questions you might have about the existing regulatory framework that telcos face.

Q1: Is the information on wireless broadband [mobile internet] speeds currently available to consumers *transparent enough* to help them make informed choices?

Q2: If it is difficult [for telcos] to commit to a minimum download speed, then could an
average speed be specified by service providers? What should
be the parameters for calculating this average speed?

Q3: What changes can be brought about to the *existing framework* on
wireless broadband tariff plans to encourage better transparency
and comparison between plans offered by different service
providers?

Q4: Is there a need to *include or delete* any of the *QoS parameters*
and/or revise any of the benchmarks currently stipulated in the
Regulations?

Q5: Should disclosure of *average network performance* over a period
of time or at peak times including through broadband facts/labels
be made *mandatory*?

Q6: Should standard application/websites be identified for mandating
comparable disclosures about network speeds?

Q7: What are the products/technologies that can be used to measure
actual end-user experience on mobile broadband networks? At
what level should the measurements take place (e.g., on the 
device, network node)?

Q8: *Are there any legal, security, privacy or data sensitivity issues
with collecting device level data?*

a) If so, how can these issues be addressed?  
b) Do these issues create a challenge for the adoption of any
measurement tools?

Q9: What measures can be taken to *increase awareness among
consumers* about wireless broadband speeds, availability of
various technological tools to monitor them and any potential
concerns that may arise in the process?

Q10: Any other issue related to the matter of Consultation.

Remember, if there's something that you think this consultation paper missed out on, include it in response to question 10."

Some users pointed that there is no good journalism. But that's not right. There is a good journalism but we have to find it. I am creating these lists to help ourselves. As a conscious and educated citizens we have to be careful as much as we can. Sometime you can find a good article in the bad list and a poor article in the good list. Above lists are not strictly implying but providing a general idea for us to be careful.

Science/Technology,"2nd semester ending, No hopes for any internship [Need Guidance]","It feels like I have wasted my 1 year,  2nd semester is ending and I don't have any internship. Now, my university is going to force me to take their summer training on web development which is the thing that I totally hate. My SGPA is 8.76 as I focused more studies and less on learning any specific technology. I have some projects but, only one big project in which I developed a program for the tech event that was hosted in our university. 

My area of interests are Data Science, Computer Vision, and Psychology. I tried to get into Data Science but, seniors said that learn Mathematics first. When I tried Computer vision, they said learn linear algebra first. So, I started learning linear algebra as well. So, now I am just banging head over books.  I don't know what to do, I am stuck. 

I don't want to waste my summer attending something that I am not interested in, please guide me.

Science/Technology,[Guide] Building your resume while in college as a CS Engineering student - Personal Projects [Part 2 / 4],"If you are in first year of engineering, I highly suggest you read [Part One](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c87jbg/guide_building_your_resume_while_in_college_as_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) here before coming to part 2.

Post part 1, you should have acquired three main skills

* You must know one programming language with medium-to-expert proficiency
* You must have a rough idea of what Object Oriented Programming languages is and what Object Oriented Design is. Its an added bonus if you have worked with an OOP language like Java / C++
* You must have built something small, learned how to debug / write basic test cases.

A great addition that /u/esotericaniket added was the ability to read code. As they advised, you could pickup Github repos that are at the same skill level as you and start reading code. If that code makes sense to you, you've made great progress. If it doesn't, adapt, improvise, overcome.

This post will target someone who is in the second year of engineering.  Now, if you followed the first post closely, you would have a list of clubs in your college handy. There are two scenarios :

1. Your college does not have clubs.
2. Your college has average clubs
3. Your college has good clubs

I will elaborate on all three scenarios and help you take your learning forward. As usual, I am open to any addition / changes.

**Scenario 1 :** Your college does not have clubs

No issues, a lot of colleges do not have clubs. In this case, I'd recommend continuing your learning experience by building a little bigger thing or getting an industry internship.

**1.1 Build something people can use**

When it comes to building something, this isn't similar to how you built something in the previous post. Your focus here should be to solve a real world problem and something that attracts / helps at least 10 users. Say, you don't know what to do in the weekend. You can work with the Zomato API and make an app that will choose a random restaurant and recommend it to you. You can also add other APIs that will generate a list of things that you can do. This is just an example, but you see how you can find people using this kind of a thing? I hope you do.

You will have to spend sometime analyzing the problem around you first and how you can solve the problem.

So, the obvious question comes:

**1.1.1 How can I find a problem and how do I analyze a problem?**

Start small. Don't think about saving the world, think about saving your friends. Try to figure out a part in your life that can be automated or a small feature that might help make your life better. This doesn't have to be a disrupting solution. If you find such a problem/solution, good. If you don't, pickup an already solved problem and solve it your way. I will elaborate on this later. While thinking about the problem, do not think about code / technologies / solutions / effort. Just focus on the problem. No matter how big the problem is, we will see how to tackle it later.

**Finding a problem -&gt; Finding a solution -&gt; Designing a solution -&gt; Implementing -&gt; Testing is an iterative cycle.**

**1.1.1.1** **Solving a New Problem**

Here, I am assuming you have found a new problem. If you haven't, skip to the next section. Once you have a problem in hand, analyze if the problem really needs a solution or its okay. Take an example of a hostel where every floor has only 2 washrooms and availability becoming an issue is your problem. If you decide to solve this by building an application to mark washrooms as vacant or not / book the washroom, it might not be an ideal thing because its a headache to use. If you say you will add a device that will track occupancy of the washroom and automatically device a queue based system on first-come-first-serve basis based on request, it will again be an overkill as the person in need of the washroom might as well just go wait outside instead use your solution.

So, once you establish that your problem does require a solution, try to think about a solution. Again, at this point, don't think about HOW you will implement the solution. Don't think about the programming language, framework, etc. Just think of the solution. I will take the same example of having an application that will tell you a random thing to do in the weekend. Think about how one would go about this problem currently. The steps they'd take is probably something like :

1. Visit websites about restaurants, pubs, events, cinemas and theater.
2. Filter by date, nearness and other criteria
3. Book.

Your goal has to be automate 1 and 2 by building this app. Identify a few sources that have free to use APIs that help you do 1 and 2 and now you have the basic solution in mind.

**1.1.1.2** **Solving an existing problem**

Did you not find any problem that you could solve? No issues, it does happen. Now start taking a problem that is already solved. Make an app that's already there or solve a problem that is already solved, but all by yourself without referring the solution. A simple problem would be money management. You can make an application that will help you manage your money. There are 10 thousand apps that help you manage your money, so why should you do one? A simple answer is because you did not build the other 10 thousand apps, so this app will be YOURS truly.

**1.1.2 Solution Description**

You now have a problem at hand. Now think about the solution. Make a list that describes your solution and the features that your solution has, what will be the mode of access (Mobile App / Web App / Command Line Interface / API) and some thinking points that you want to note while implementing the solution. Be sure to document all of these if possible, maybe in very simple terms.

**1.1.3 Implementation**

**1.1.3.1 What will I use?**

Now, personally I have been a fan of learning by doing. So, I would suggest you spend a couple of hours in looking up what suits your need the best and what can be easily learned. Both these things are very important. For example, if I want to make a Money Management application, I can definitely start learning Java and build a native Android App. But is that what will be ideal? Is there a way I can expose this application to multiple platforms? Or make it platform independent? We will have to think of our users to come to this conclusion.

As an other example, if your idea is to track a Git repository and send a notification when there is an issue raised in that repo, an application might not be the best way. A telegram / Whatsapp / email bot might be ideal there. So, do your research

Also identify if you can use any APIs or existing service instead of re-inventing the wheel.

Document these.

**1.1.3.2 How do I begin?**

Now that you know what to use, the next question is how to begin. The way I would start is usually cloning the Hello World application of the the framework/language that I have chosen and use that as a starting point to write on top of. This MAY not be the right way, but it has worked for me.

Its totally okay to clone a project and make changes to it. But, if you want to not do this, the other way is to set everything up from scratch. I strongly recommend referring to the official documentation at some point in your coding life cycle. (The earlier, the better).

Whatever you do, remember to put it on Git(hub/lab). Have a Readme file that describes your idea and commit your changes regularly. If you don't know how git works, take some time to understand that. (Maybe thats an interesting topic to cover in the future?)

**Scenario 2 :** Your college has average clubs

Now, in this case you can either give up and follow the Scenario 1 route or do some analysis on why these clubs are average. Mostly (and this is ONLY from my experience), a lot of clubs have good ideas with busy/technically challenged mentors. I've seen good mentors have good ideas and still would want to do things the old way wasting a lot of time in documentation where they expect you to document the code even before you begin coding, instead of prototyping and then documenting. Both have their fair share of pros and cons, but I think today's generation would rather have a proof of concept than have gazillion documents which describe every small aspect of the idea.

If your professors or mentors aren't upto the mark, resistant to change and micromanage projects, I would sincerely advice you to not pursue this. Having said that, I would advice you to give it a try temporarily to see if you can change things. Set a deadline in your mind, say, 1 month. If you don't have anything proper to show in a month, quit and start your learning on your own.

**Scenario 3 :** Your college has good clubs

In this case, pick a good project. Preferably something that you can complete. A good set of projects to pick would be something that has already been started and you can see yourself completing it. The next best thing would be to work on a project that is still in the idea phase. 

When you pick a project, don't just pick it because it has a lot of buzz words. Think about the project, do your homework, check if there are existing projects that do the same thing and then validate how you are going to be better than the existing project. Basically, you will need to believe that the problem you are solving is worth solving and/or can be solved in a stipulated time. 

You spending time writing an application that will digitalize attendance in your college is much better than trying to write ML models to do some task that you don't believe in and have no idea about.

Stay in good touch with your guide. Meet them regularly, update them with your progress, your learning, roadblocks and deadlines. Your end goal should be to get an internship certificate and a letter of recommendation from your mentor.

Preferably, log the work you have done everyday and aim to do better than you did on the previous day. If possible, use Git to put your code online!

I am sorry for the delay in the post and for giving very less importance to Scenario 2 and 3. I will be taking any kind of questions in the comment box. I might be late in replying because I am currently busy with work. But I will definitely reply to you.

Also, if you feel you are stuck in a hellhole, are lost and have no way of coming out of this mess that is engineering and coding, please do DM me and we can schedule some time to have a chat! I will definitely try to help you out.

My next post will be about Internships in your 3rd year, how to get them, how to leverage your learning, how to choose good internships, face interviews, etc! A lot of writing might go into that, so I can't promise you a deadline. But I will try to keep it before the second week of August. :)

As usual, any modifications to my wall of text are welcome!

I checked with the seller later, and said he wants cash and the broker is getting him cash - so looks like this guy is not just a real estate broker now, but a bitcoin broker too.

Noped the fuck out of it, no way I'm converting my white money into black for these guys.

What surprises me is that this didn't happen in some big town or city - but in a smaller place 30kms away from the nearest headquarters, and a very normal village."

Science/Technology,"Hydroponics and Agtech Entrepreneurship in India | Dhrav Khanna, Triton Foodworks","For the last 10 years, I have spent the majority of my time looking at sustainability as a function of  urbanization, and the resource footprints of urban residents, in Asia.

Particularly how will Asia' urban systems be challenges by the movement of the next two billion Asians moving into cities (by 2030), and what the role of entrepreneurs and innovators will be as THE force to deliver the solutions required for sustainability in local environments, economies, and communities.

So, while the news surrounding Chennai's water shortage are now top of mind, and in keeping in mind there are dozens of other cities in India that are under similar threat, earlier this year I met with an amazing entrepreneur named Dhrav Khanna of Delhi based Triton Foodworks and interviewed him about his work.

It was an amazing discussion, similar to those I have had in Bangkok, Singapore, and Hong Kong, and while I was impressed by his systems, and saw similar challenges in business model, the one thing I really appreciated was in his approach to measuring how much water his systems saved again traditional farming.

The interview is around 20 minutes, so it is not short, but if you are an Indian looking for examples of individuals who are solving local problems using local innovation, this is a great interview and I hope you will share this with your networks.

Chandrayaan-2 is scheduled to land near the unexplored south pole of the Moon.

This mission focuses on the Moon, to find useful information about water, minerals and measuring moon-quakes.

India used its most powerful rocket, the **Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark III (GSLV Mk-III)**, for this mission. It weighed 640 tonnes (almost 1.5 times the weight of a fully-loaded 747 jumbo jet) and, at 44 meters (144ft), and was as high as a 14-story building. The journey is assumed to be a little more than six weeks, which is a lot longer than the four days the Apollo 11 mission took, 50 years ago, to land humans on the Moon for the first time.

To save fuel, ISRO has chosen an indirect route to benefit off of the Earth's gravity, which will help fasten the satellite towards the Moon. of the Earth's

""There will be 15 terrifying minutes for scientists once the lander is released and is hurled towards the south pole of the Moon,"" ISRO chief K Sivan said before the first launch attempt.

He explained that those who are controlling the spacecraft until it lands the moon will have to sit back and pray because the landing is automated. So, the actual landing would happen only if all the systems performed as they should. Otherwise, the satellite could crash into the surface of the Moon.

Food,Top of the food chain? Think again.,"It only takes a small nanometer dimensioned entity to bring the entire human race to a halt. Whatever happened to WE the pioneers. Imagine, this was going to be the year in which we were going to put ideas like autonomous cars, flying cars, space tourism, asteroid mining, hyper-looping etc in action. Now, we are rushing to the grocery stores and fighting over trivial things like paper to wipe our backs. 

There is a quote in the movie Interstellar:

*”We’ve always defined ourselves by the ability to overcome the impossible. And we count these moments. These moments when we dare to aim higher, to break barriers, to reach for the stars, to make the unknown known. We count these moments as our proudest achievements. But we lost all that.
Or perhaps we’ve just forgotten that we are still pioneers. And we’ve barely begun. And that our greatest accomplishments cannot be behind us, because our destiny lies above us”*

It almost feels like that our systems, our unity, our spirit, our patience and our human sensitivities are all getting tested at the same time. The Hope that there is another tomorrow keeps us all moving and fighting. 

It however goes without saying the C-scare has truly shown the fragility of our existence. We need to pause. We need to think what is truly important. We need to focus. It is time to rethink. We have not found another worlds. We have not found a way to escape yet. 

This is it. Let’s push this out and remember to not go back to our arrogant ignorant selves. Else, we will waste a perfect disaster to evolve as Humans first.

We will survive this. However, why waste an adversity. Let’s use it to change the course of future."

Food,Vegetarianism in India has more to do with caste hierarchy than love for animals,"
Why do vegetarians in India prefer social distance from non-vegetarians? A look at caste-wise food preferences could provide some insights. As is common knowledge, the ranking of castes is mostly influenced by purity of occupation and diet. In caste-society, to achieve purity of body and spirit, it is necessary to be a vegetarian and religious simultaneously – something best embodied by a Brahmin.

The percentage of non-vegetarians among Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, both for men and women, is much higher than among those who are not from these communities. And in the latter group, the highest incidence of vegetarianism is found among Brahmins at almost over 50%. The higher the caste, the greater the possibility of them being pure vegetarians.

The burden of diet-purity and vegetarianism is, however, more on women than men.

Broadly, present-day vegetarianism in India constitutes a form of moral power of minority within Hindus, with such a power being forced on the non-vegetarian majority – with their consent. This new sociality is a sign of progress in modern caste belief where the seductive power of vegetarianism and its associated purity travels seamlessly across bodies and spaces without dissent.

How fragile must the morals of the vegetarian castes be if they feel threatened by the introduction of eggs for poor children in schools? The morals of Indian vegetarians continue to be based less on compassion for humans and animals, and more driven by ideas of hierarchy and purity. In this scheme of hierarchy, one who eats beef is placed at the lowest rung. Like humans of caste, not all animals carry equal sympathy: there exists some hierarchy where the cow (indigenous, not jersey) takes the highest sacral form compared to the rest. Gandhi improvised his vegetarianism through inflicting violence and control on the self. Present-day caste-subjects and their vegetarianism, however, thrive on violence, both on the self and others. The state across India through various governments has mostly been party to this process, promoting the hegemony of misguided vegetarianism."

How do I explain it, not only I feel burning sensation in my mouth and chest but it also feels uncomfortable after eating & I have a hard time digesting it. Maybe it’s because of genetics. By spice I don’t mean just chilli but other spices too.

Back in home, all things are cooked without spices. Wedding ceremonies become a nightmare sometimes. Fortunately, I’ve a sweet tooth to make up for it and enjoy sweet things in general. 

After 12th I moved out and went to Kota for medical preparation. And food in my hostel was absolute nightmare (but average according to others), I suffered from acidity & sickness the entire year. Situation didn’t improve all even in my college life with the limited things I can eat. Also, I can’t eat outside with the few friends I have, unless it’s McDonald’s or KFC, which is rare since most of time they hang out, they always prefer dinner at some restaurant instead. Eating just Hakka noodles & salad isn’t worth it.

Edit: *I’ve read that our taste buds and nerves use various proteins (called TRP channels) to detect various substances that give most spices their distinctive taste. Most of these proteins are activated by many different spices. Our spice tolerance depends on our genetics, people have mutations of these proteins which influence our final sensation of spices since most food have blend of different spices.

I didn't prepare for this, I had in my mind that I didn't need to horde stuff cause atleast essential stores like groceries would be open. Doesn't this just incentivise people hording?

>To be honest, they never really liked you, but even in this time of our biggest existential crisis also, when you need all of us, every single citizen of India, to back you with all our might, they don't like you.

*“No, we wanted him to assure them that they will be taken care of in terms of food, shelter and social security in his 30 minutes monologue before announcing the lockdown. Which would not make this Exodus in the first place (or maybe numbers would have been very low).

Not everyone has the privilege of being illiterate and herds of followers who will listen to all his bullshit and won’t dare to ask a single question. Period.”*

>They don't like you for the confidence and morale boosting in your speech that united and channelized an entire nation of a billion and they still don't like you when you exude humility and awareness of the situation by apologising to the poor of the country for having to do this to them and the nation.

>Their walls are filled with posts on migrants' sufferings but never a single post on what could be the solution to save lives without collateral damage.

We went there and ordered immediately. They had a relatively small/decent menu but most of the things were not available. We ordered Panner Bhurji and Chicken Keema. 
It took 30-35 minutes before the sabzis arrived and then further 4-5 minutes for rotis. 
The chicken had so much black pepper, you could not even taste the chicken. Then we tried Paneer and it was now lemon instead of pepper (Or maybe Panner had turned foul). It was awful."
Food,Delhi style authentic Butter Chicken recipe,"Delhi style Butter Chicken, very close to what you get at Moti Mahal, the inventor of Butter Chicken.

The Delhi style Butter chicken is all about generosity. You need a gravy that's creamy, not oily or greasy. And it's a very heavy dish, reserved for special occasions. 

&gt;Step 1: The Chicken.

First, let's make the chicken. Traditionally, Tandoori Chicken is used but since it's not possible to make it at home, let's make something close. 
Take 500 grams of chicken  boneless or with bones. 
Add lime juice, salt and marinate for 30 mins. 

After 30 mins, squeeze off excess water from the chicken and add kashmiri red chilli, tandoori masala, 2 tsp of mustard oil and leave it to marinate for 1 hour. 

Now cook the chicken by placing it on a hot pan. Do not flip it constantly. Let it cook for 10 mins on each side. It takes about 30-35 mins to get fully cooked. 
Once the chicken is cooked, keep it aside. 

&gt;Step 2: The Gravy

Gravy is the most important thing. For this, take 4 tomatoes and throw in a pressure cooker for 4 whistles. 
Now puree the tomatoes and run them through a sieve. 

Now cook the filtered tomato puree in a non stick pan for 30-40 mins. Keep adding water if it goes too dry. 

Now your gravy and chicken are done. 

&gt;Step 3: Butter Chicken. 

Now it's time to combine and make butter chicken. 

Just  before you want to eat, in a hot pan, add your tomato gravy. Now add some chilli powder, two green chillies, salt and stir. Taste and adjust salt as needed. Now add the chicken. 

Notice how we haven't added any butter or oil till now to the gravy? That's because it's crucial not to add the butter and cream until the very end. 

Now it's time to add a good amount of butter For a typical serving, I suggest 40 grams of butter. 

Once the butter has melted, add 150 ml of fresh, low-fat cream. (I use amul). 
Butter chicken gravy is 40% tomatoes and 60% butter and cream. 

Mix it all together and immediately turn off the flame. 
Before serving, add some Kasuri Methi to finish off. 

Follow these steps and you'll get Butter Chicken that tastes exactly like Delhi Butter Chicken."

Food,"Goa is STARVING due to 100% lockdown, and I need you to know about us","I cannot take this anymore! The retarded CM of Goa has imposed a full lockdown. This means that NO grocery shops are allowed to open. I might survive for a week by eating a single meal per day with a dangerously compromised immunity during this ongoing pandemic, but think of the numerous infants and elderly dependents who need supplements and special medications and form the most vulnerable sections prone to COVID-19.

**The state of Goa has also breached the centre's direct order by shutting down ALL food supplies and outlets in the state.**

Foreign nationals stuck in the state are already trying to get international media's attention to this crisis , but we need more voices!

The nail in the coffin for me was seeing [THIS](https://twitter.com/ArvindKejriwal/status/1243078456671236098) tweet by Delhi's CM. He's allowed 24X7 operation of all grocery stores in his jurisdiction which felt like a gut-punch as a Goan. We haven't had fresh supply in nearly five days!

Please do not trust any news outlet or journalists claiming that Goa has things under control. Goan government's policy is literally murdering its own people to tackle COVID-19.

If Corona doesn't get us, starvation surely will. If you can, at the very least, tweet, tag, or shame the Goan administration. It's a total nightmare!  


**EDITS:**

Someone just filed a petition against Goa's government: 

[Advocate Rohit Bras de Sa files letter petition before HC on account of scarcity of essential commodities & lack of machanism to provide basic food supply to vulnerable wage workers, says people of Goa are struggling to find even basic goods to sustain themselves in curfew days](https://twitter.com/prudentgoa/status/1243101931666468869)

If you want to lend your support on Twitter, retweet the following tweet en mass. It's from Zoe, a foreign national, who's been trying to get international media's attention on the issue: 

[Brits & foreigners stranded in Goa, India. The state has closed all shops for past three days. Residents & tourists have not been able to buy any essentials, there has been police brutality, videoed beatings.

Food,I'm working on autonomous drones for micro-payloads (food/medicines) in urban environments. I'm interested in using this experience in building self-driving cars in India. Anybody interested?," Hi, I'm in my final year and I'm working on autonomous drones,  specialized for navigating in urban landscapes. Also, I'm using a  vision-only approach, no LiDAR, just a bunch of small cams. I'd like to  use this experience to build a self-driving car in India, mainly because  it seems like there's no focussed entity working on this in our country  and ours is a relatively untapped market, with a huge potential for  growth. We don't have enough road network in our country, so  self-driving cars won't be a thing in our country, even in say 25 years  from now and car ownership is at max 30M. Other forms of vehicles like  self-driving ""autos"" or some sort of a pick-up robotaxi vehicle will be  huge in our country. There's is a solid market for freight transport:  trucks, etc, which is another untapped market for autonomous vehicles.  Is this a frivolous pursuit in a country like India? If you're  interested, would you like to join me?"

Food,Figuring out a cost-effective Indian Gain-It diet," 

I know r/gainit exists, and it has been really helpful for broad guidelines, but when it comes to diet planning, I find that a lot of the suggestions there are tailored to a western (and mostly NA perspective). Food pricing varies a lot from geography to geography, and a lot of the cheap suggestions on that sub aren't really cheap back here, especially in comparison to income levels. Add to it the fact that many of us are vegetarians too.

Hence trying to build out a list of food items, both bulking and clean; veg as well as non-veg. **Help me please people!!**

PS: A dirty secret that I've come across is ghee and coconut oil. Adding them to your Dal post cooking (I can't stand coconut oil though) helps you (at the cost of fats though)."

Now, everybody has different unprofessional diagnosis and advice for that kinda thing; muscle sprain, pulled, knot. The most original I've heard is that all the spices somehow build up gas that can get stuck in the back; should go away over a few days or with a muscle relaxant. Apparently that would be a pretty common phenomenon in India, including amongst Indians themselves. To me that sounds pretty pseudoscience, can't any source about it anyway.

Food,Why some foreigners treat Indian street foods as Ewww ?,"I seriously don't understand their benchmark for food and it's hygienic. I saw many foreigners don't use gloves to prepare the Pizza, Many chefs rotate the dough in empty hand. Don't know how old the chicken / bacon is ? Most of them are processed food which is dangerous than non hygienic foods.

And their Pizza smells like shit to me. And they have more cancer patients compare to Indians (5th place in the whole world)

I know KFC is not even hygienic, Saw many controversies and some of their branches are banned in India.

But when it comes to Indian foods they say Ewww,  Yuck,... You Indians are dirty...

WHY THIS ?  


PS:  They say yuck to our homemade food too."

Food,Anyone worried that a Riot might break out ?,"While the Lockdown is happening with varying degrees of effectiveness across the country, there are many who criticize its implementation and effectiveness. But what's done is done and there's no use debating it further, atleast until all of this blows over.

What I am worried about is people feeling like they are being repressed against their best interests and retaliating en masse.

Currently, the people are ignoring the Lockdown due to two reasons.

1. They don't understand the seriousness of the situation. 

2. They don't have enough supplies and/or are worried about their survival

The Police cracking down on them using violence might instill the idea that the Lockdown is implemented not for their benefit. A lack of certainty about essential commodities adds more fuel to the fire. Reading about the situation in Goa, I couldn't help but feel that the people are on the verge of their breaking point. And if the situation in the Hospitals reaches a point where, like in Italy, the Doctors have to choose whose life to save, I can't imagine how the people would react.

I don't mean to cause unnecessary panic or worry to the people reading this post. I just want to know whether the Government has considered this ( I am trying to be optimistic here ) and have a proper plan in place to avoid it. I would also like to know if people like me can help spread awareness and help alleviate the situation."
Food,Learning to cook - Need 9-10 healthy dishes (ideas/recipes). Preferably without a pressure cooker.,"Hello. I'm at a point where I have rented a small place (I'm alone here) in Hyderabad, and might be here for a while.

I have never made anything except tea/coffee/Maggi, and I really wanna learn to cook *nutritious food* . Trying to start slow and learn 9-10 good dishes so that I can keep Swiggy usage to a minimum. Preferably without a pressure cooker, but I'm open to getting one *later*.

Foods -
Vegetarian food, eggs, and chicken

Tools - 
1. 1 induction heater
2. Something similar to this set - Prestige Omega Special Pack (3 Piece BYK Set, Both Gas Stove &amp; Induction Compatible) https://www.amazon.in/dp/B07SPZS1HL/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_yf9rDbTVD8NCE
3. The regular spatulas, spoons, etc.

Trying not to buy a pressure cooker right now. If I can make something decent and if I remain in Hyderabad for some months, will get one later.

Tentative ideas so far (just asking family and guessing) - 

1. Omelette
2. Spinach with some bell peppers
3. Carrots and beans sabzi
4. Bhindi with onions
5. Mixing bell peppers with some scrambled eggs?? (Is this even a legit dish?)
6. Poha with onions, tomatoes, and groundnuts

The vegetable bhaiyyas were setting up when the cops came. Their major issue was the bhaiyyas clustering together and not maintaining distance. I talked to one policeman (this is a new guy, not in uniform, that I am seeing today). He said they'll let things run as long as people remain social distancing norms. They also don't want people to come everyday to buy vegetables but stock up. They let me buy vegetables.

These people are at many times the only breadwinners of the family. Can we be so ignorant, that we readily allow entire families of poor to get destroyed? Some  owners of factories, contractors have simply haven't paid these workers and simply turned a blind eye towards these people. 

People like you and me have plenty of surplus money and resources. There are people who literally completely depend on their next month's salary to run their houses. How do you think would they manage?

Government just abruptly closed down the entire nation. What arrangement did it make so that the poor reach their homes along with their familes safely? It is not as simple as booking a cab or renting a car for them. People are literally walking miles and miles to reach home. Why aren't these people being given masks, being scanned or being disinfected? People are being brutally tortured by the police. Don't they deserve spending this dark and difficult time with their familes, in their homes?
Try to imagine the immense fear and desperation and the helplessness of these people.

Everybody is praising the Indian government on how efficiently they brought an early lockdown. They don't realize what the poor are going through, simply because the society doesn't care about them.

As i was about to eat,  zomato' personnel contacted me and said that you had ordered twice so do you wish to receive the second order too to which i replied saying that i had ordered only once and had recieved it too...so he told me if you have any problem contact through email or chat support. So the second order was cancelled and now cancellation charges are levied.
Every time i call them, or use chat support or send them an email they keep telling their policy that if order is cancelled,cancellation charges can't be removed.
They didn't even cross check from burger king or check call records of their delivery boy as to whether i actually received it or not.
No acknowledgement is sent to me in respect of the order i paid for..only the cancelled order is shown in the order section of their app.
Also, Their delivery boy is lying..he gave me the order.. took the money but didn't update the order status..
So for one order i am basically asked to pay twice.

I have been a faithful customer and have ordered multiple times through zomato but still i am held accountable for this issue even though its not my fault.

Guys dont order from zomato app...customer support is terribly slow and awful and they take ages to resolve it..and then they say "" your issue is really old thus it can't be resolved or as per our company' policy we can't solve your issue""."

Food,Masala Box Review,"Hi All,

I tried Masala Box for 5 days. North Indian Veg for Dinner. I stay in Mahadevpura around 2-3km from Bagamane World Technology Center. Now I subscribed through the app for the classic North Indian Veg dinner.

I am just letting everyone else know of my experience:-

The food arrived at around 8-9pm on all days, I didn't ask for a specific time nor did they, not sure if you can specify the time of delivery.

The delivery guy has a ton of parcels so you have to go get it, no door delivery :(

The food comes neatly packaged in a plastic container with 2 compartments for Daal, Sabji, 2 Chapatis &amp; Rice or Just Rice(1 day only), Raita, Salad, pickle. (If you choose South Indian you get curd, I didn't find any option to change from Raita to curd in the app)

Now the food seemed healthy with Salad **BUT the food was COLD** like always cold cold, never warm never ever. The Masala Box Customer care people requested for feedback the next day I informed them regarding my suggestion of using traditional steal dabbas rather than the throwaway plastic and also **please deliver the food hot**

And for the remaining 4 days, I ate the cold cold food. I have no idea if the food can be reheated in a microwave in the plastic throwaway plate/container they give.

Considering the price you pay I really want my food hot. For people thinking of going for masala box please go for the 5 days meal to see if it's going to work out for you.

For me, it just didn't workout...

EDIT:

Forgot the most important bit, not sure if I am a heavy eater or something but the food quantity was not sufficient as well. 2 chapatis and rice they provided was okay for me, I won't say was sufficient or more than enough, not sure about others.

EDIT:

By **Salad** I mean some carrots+cucumber or onion+radish or watermelon+cucumber pieces in a small box, please don't misunderstand it for the fancy salads with dozens of sauces/dressings

The amount I paid for 5 days was Rs.675 I think, the daal had a mix of sprouts or some veggies depending on the day, the dry vegetable was not repeated.

The per-meal cost comes down based on the number of days, For example, the cost for 30 days is Rs. 3000 (100 per meal). If you take the monthly plan you get 30 meals with a validity of 50 days as in you can choose which days you want the meal to be delivered within those 50 days.

**Note**

The aim of this post was not to bash or malign any tiffin service but just my personal opinion about the service, let people know about how things were since I could not find many reviews related to the service.

The website seems down I guess posting the review on Reddit really gave the site a heck of a lot of attention! :P"

To the best of my knowledge and assessment of the situation, we're about to get deluged in a wave of cases for which it is impossible to be adequately prepared. Many will die. The govt is trying, but whatever they arrange will never be enough for the general population to get off lightly. 

People panic buying food and medical supplies have created a vicious cycle so much so that I doubt if there will be enough meds for the frontline workers. This could potentially lead to more deaths in the healthcare workers, that could secondarily translate to a higher death rate in the patients.

People not taking quarantine seriously. Their actions today will kill many. Mostly their old, young, and sick family members, neighbours, or roommates.

In the meantime there's talk of having us work in makeshift corona wards from where we won't be able to return home. We'll probably stay on campus in recently emptied undergrad hostels. 

I don't mind working on campus and not coming home for weeks, maybe months. I don't mind dying too much either. ( I'm not super high-risk comorbidity-wise. I'm young. I run. But the stress is making me relapse into my smoking habit, and who knows what that might mean with this infection!) But the one thing that scares me shitless is that I don't know who will take care of my dogs at home. 

I hope I'm proved wrong in the coming weeks.

To negate the fatalism, if you're inside, avoiding ALL outside contact, you'll probably be able to delay infection to such time when we'll be better prepared to fight this thing with real world patient data, maybe new meds or even vaccines. Also death rates are generally low for young and fit patients."

The ads are made in a way, it looks like that condoms are sex enhancers. They give more pleasure. Where the opposite is true. Also that's not the purpose of the condom anyway.

Condoms are not sexy. Condom ads should not be sexy either. It should contain an old white haired wise looking doctor (to get the attention of the parents) where he tells the actual job of the condom and why it is important. We don't need Sunny Leone twerking on the beach with a strawberry in her hands.

Food,[Stupid but serious question] Won't there be a point where loss of life and economy due to lockdown will be greater than loss of life due to coronavirus?,"I am from West Bengal. And honestly, the lockdown is scaring me really bad. The prices of food items like potatoes, tomatoes, etc have risen significantly, or the supplies are almost finished. Many shops which sell basic groceries are closed and their owners say they are afraid if they will be arrested by the police even though groceries have been exempted. Even though I am from a middle class family, I know many low income families who are more paranoid about this situation. If people don't get to eat, they will die from hunger anyways.

I don't know about Economics, but is there a possibility that people might die more because of the lockdown rather than coronavirus? Many vegetables are absolutely finished in our local markets, and given that most vegetables, meat, etc come through local trains which are now non-operational, how will we get basic stuff like food? From what I know, poor people still have ration card to meet their requirements, and rich people, well, have their money to get through the system. What about most of us? 

Another thing is jobs. Due to these shutdowns, the businesses will face huge losses, jobs like hawkers, small shops, cottage industries, chaiwala, panwala, panipuriwala, etc will mostly go without any money. And if this lockdown is extended, which it most probably will, won't several million people just die due to lack of money and food?

Edit: I sometimes go on Libertarian sub (curiosity) and there someone said this that the population cannot sustain this and that this can be solved by just quarantining the old people and nothing else, i.e., no lockdown or travel ban or anything, just quarantining of old people because Covid 19 apparently doesn't harm young people. Is this really a sound solution?"

Food,"Drinking hot water, avoiding cold foods - prep for the virus","This is a question for the doctors of this subreddit or anyone who can answer it with any kind of authority. Personal anecdotes won't really help me much.

So every Indian parent has always been a strong advocate of drinking warm water or hot water and all kinds of other shit like milk with turmeric or gargling regularly even before the virus. But now they have more ammunition. Now you have to do these things if you want to beat the virus. I also want to include vitamin C tablets to the purview of this question as ""they boost immunity"". 

I'm not going to argue against whatever health benefits these things might have normally. I'm sure they're great. But my dad has a whatsapp recording of some guy who has a friend in China (idfk as if that claim makes the recording more authentic) where the guy goes through a list of things to help you prep against the virus. 

He makes a case for how warm water doesn't let mucus collect and takes it to your stomach where gastric acids deal w it. And says to avoid cold foods during these times. Alnd take vit C. And gargle regularly.

I guess my question how exactly do these things help against the virus, if at all?  And if they don't how do I convince my parents to calm down?

I also want to add the reason for my cynicism is I've heard doctors say that you can try supplements for improving immunity but nothing can really help you from getting the virus. And don't cold foods only worsen the symptoms of an existing cold virus instead of causing it? No one is implying eating ice cream will give you corona but their implication is that eating cold foods will make you weak against corona. I hope I can get a definite answer out of this that I can carry around for the rest of my life."

Food,So this happened with my food delivery,"Today I ordered some food from swiggy. Order status was showing Delivery executive collected food and is on the way but from tracking his bike was showing off the route and it got delayed by 10-15 min so I called executive and he said he is on the way and will meet me in 2 min my apartment gate. I thought maybe some GPS tracking issue.

I went to gate to collect but he did not show up, so I called him and he again said within 2 min he will be there.

Finally he delivered food, When I checked gravy I found quantity was less than usual (50%). Also some gravy was over the package. I immediately felt something is fishy. I suspect that he took away some part of food.

I opened app and checked for help but to my surprise order status was still not showing delivered. I could not report the case.

After waiting for while I cancelled order from my end to get refund and got 100% back.

I was waiting for call from the delivery guy or swiggy but there is no call so far (more than hour now).

I dont think swiggy is at fault here and I am also not 100% sure with my suspicion. 

What do you think of it guys ?

TLDR : Order got delivered late, I suspect food was taken away, No confirmation of order deliverey, had to cancel myself despite receiving package. Got refund but feel something is fishy."

Food,"The plight of daily wagers shows how wrong Indian society is. Instead of giving people fair wages, we are now donating to ""feed the wager"" campaigns as if they are some animals needing help.","No where in the civilized world can you get a human to do stuff for you, 12 hours a day, for less than Rs. 300.   
The people working as masons, painters, fabrication welders etc. are all paid less than the minimum wage in most cities, despite being quite skilled at their work. Same goes for maids and cooks in most parts of the country. Someone I know hires a full time maid for 20k in Mumbai, with food and lodging included. But many don't get that much, especially in smaller cities and villages. Security guards even in places like Gurgaon and Delhi earn less than 10k a month.   
Growing up, it was common to see and expect a slum in the vicinity of a new apartment complex because that is where the ""bais"" and their ""car-washing"" husbands stay. That has not changed at all, it has worsened now and slums are home to many more professions (including TEACHERS of all people). 

We often hear people say ""life in India is really good because you have a maid, a cook and a driver for daily life"". This is because these folks never got what they deserved. They are exploited and without contracts. 

I find it incredibly insensitive to see campaigns like ""feed a daily wager"" as if they are zoo animals. No one gives a shit about their well being and fair pay when they should. The ""good life"" in India is because the middle class and the rich just want the wagers to survive like animals. Nowhere in the world would this same middle class with their level of income, even if they earn in USD, get so many human services for such cheap rates. 

I believe this is happening to white collar jobs as well. For all the ""no-skills-in-graduates"" bullshit, many graduates even from good colleges almost work for free and have to depend on their parents. 

TLDR: Indians brag about having maids and cooks and cleaners as a quality of life enhancer. Truth is that they can afford them ONLY because they are being exploited. The current campaigns to ""feed the wager"" could have been more sensitive to their plight and focused on creating a formal, contracted workforce of helpers, and unorganized sector employees."

* All the people eligible for MBPY ( for below poverty line/handicapped/senior citizens) got extra ₹4000 cash to spend on groceries during 21 day lockdown.

* Poor kids studying in “anganwadi” also got some amount of rice and food delivered to them.

* Government Doctors got their salaries of next 4 months, early.

* All the salaries of MLAs and CM of Odisha was donated for the state budget of corona virus treatment.

(I’m missing many other things too, but these are the prominent ones)

All of this was done a week before India went to lockdown. In Odisha you won’t see millions of daily wage labourers migrating to their villages right now, despite it being one of the poorer state in India.

Modi could have at least issued the responsibilities for state government before he declared lockdown overnight.

It’s not even funny when Modi government has got billions for corona virus budget and all they could do was some cheap apology."

###Headline Stories

**#Brexit Update**

This isn’t the first time that a Brexit story is here, and it’s certainly not going to be the last. The Brexit referendum is the European news media’s Donald Trump - they’re going to milk the story for all it’s worth for years to come. The country is attempting a preemptive strike against the economic downturn that all the prophecies have predicted now that it is moving out of EU. Accordingly, the UK finance minister has [announced](http://in.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-osborne-idINKCN0ZJ0VN) plans to cut corporate tax rates from 20% to 15%. For some context, most developed countries average a corporate tax rate of 25%, India taxes at 35%. As the UK’s currency fell to 31-year lows in the foreign exchange markets, the Bank of England (UK’s central bank) [eased](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/05/bank-of-england-releases-150bn-pounds-risks-financial-stability) regulations on banks which freed up £150 billion that banks can lend to people and businesses. How does any of this relate to India? UK’s Business Secretary Sajid Javid (who sports a forehead that rivals that of Sonakshi Sinha’s) is [going](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/brexit-india-uk-to-hold-trade-talks/article8823969.ece) on a world tour of nations including India to hold discussions about a possible trade treaty. Seriously, google him right now. His head is more forehead than face. 

**LPT: Don’t Be Hungry In Kerala**

Incredible India is all good, but have you tasted the food here? Clearly, India is a fat man’s paradise. If you leave out Kerala, that is. The state just [imposed](http://food.ndtv.com/food-drinks/fat-tax-introduced-in-kerala-14-5-to-be-levied-on-fast-food-chains-like-mcdonalds-1429427) a 14.5% tax on food that makes you fatter, like burgers, pizzas, sandwiches, donuts etc. While subsidies are often used to encourage consumption of certain things, on the flip side, taxes are often used to discourage consumption of certain things. And Kerala’s government just wants to discourage fat people from being fat. The move is expected to bring in additional revenue of ₹10 crore to the state while mostly affecting fast food chains like McDonalds, Subway, Pizza Hut etc. The idea of a ‘fat tax’ is nothing new - it’s been implemented in countries like Denmark and Hungary, a country that sounds a lot like hungry. Coincidence? Definitely, yeah.

Months after the banks started drowning in a pool of bad loans, the water level has come up enough to inspire some desperate deals. The nation’s second largest lender, ICICI had loaned ₹3,000 crore to Essar Steel, the Ruia-family owned company. But Essar has fallen on pretty hard times and can’t pay the loans back. So the banks got together and started searching for someone who can buy a majority stake in Essar, takeover the management and turn the company around. But it’s all fun and games until reality sets in - which is that nobody wants to even touch Essar Steel with a ten-foot pole. Last week, realizing that a solution was unlikely, ICICI [sold](http://www.livemint.com/Industry/8CVTPujGZTeE2W7iBUr45M/ICICI-Bank-sells-Essar-Steel-loan-exposure-to-Edelweiss-ARC.html) those loans worth about ₹1,600 crore to Edelweiss. The Jaypee Group, known perhaps for its cement business, found itself in similar condition where it had borrowed just a little more than it could handle. Fortunately, somebody did touch that company with a ten-foot pole. The company [sold](http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/buzzing-stocks/jp-associates-ultratech5-38rs-16189-cr-cement-deal_6982041.html) a lot of cement manufacturing plants to UltraTech Cement for ₹16,189 crore that it can potentially use to repay loans. To consolidate in times of trouble, State Bank of India is merging with its associate banks from Travancore, Mysore and others. But along with employees who fear being fired after the merger, a lot of businesses that are customers of the banks being acquired are [protesting](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/money-and-banking/now-customers-too-voice-concern-over-sbi-associate-banks-merger/article8807858.ece) the merger. Why? Well, how would you like it if your local grocery shopkeeper who knows you by name suddenly sold out to Big Bazaar?

**Loans From Flipkart**

The list of top 3 disasters in India goes like this: 1) the Bhopal Gas Tragedy, 2) Sholay-remake *Ram Gopal Verma Ki Aag* and 3) Flipkart’s Big Billion Day. The online retailer’s annual big sales event that comes every year started in 2014 and fetched the company ₹650 crore. But it was marred by failure in shipping which resulted in thousands of frustrated customers, and the company has been trying to rebuild the Big Billion Day brand ever since. The second Big Billion Day happened last year, raked in ₹2,000 crore for the company and sailed through relatively easily. This time, however, Flipkart feels shaky on being able to deliver without a glitch. It’s [making](http://thetechportal.com/2016/07/05/flipkart-brings-back-big-billion-day-major-changes/) plans to have a one huge Big Billion Day in the first week of October, followed by similar smaller events to spread the orders around. At a time when banks are becoming more cautious about lending to certain sectors of the economy, Flipkart is also planning to play matchmaker between banks and borrowers by offering pre-approved loans so you can buy now, pay later. The company is in talks with banks to arrange the loans which will be paid back by Flipkart in case people just decide to run with their Flipkart-bought flat screens and laptops.

Millions of frustrated math students in schools across India have complained a million times about how nobody is ever going to use pythagorean theorems in real life.

Business/Finance,Last Week in Parliament (July 18 to July 22),"Hello /r/India,

I return with another four weeks of fun and frolic at the expense of our elected leaders in Parliament!

Last week, a shiny new cabinet was sworn in, a spirited discussion on Kashmir crisis (and TN Fishermen and Bangladeshi infiltrators) happened, an unknown rule was invoked unknowingly and shot down promptly and many legislations were passed.
Let’s get right into it!

___
#Shiny new Cabinet sworn in
___

Apart from the [53 new members](http://164.100.47.5/Newmembers/partymemberlist.aspx) that were sworn into Rajya Sabha, PM Modi introduced his new ministers to both houses. Prakash Javadekar replaced Smriti Irani as Minister of Human Resource Development, Vijay Goyal was given Ministry of State (Independent Charge) for Youth Affairs & Sports and Anil Madhav Dave was sworn in as the new Minister of State (Independent charge) of Environment forest and Climate Change. A whole host of new Ministers of State were also sworn in. 

I know what you’re thinking.
 
*What’s the difference between a Cabinet Minister, Minister of State (Independent Charge) and Minister of State?* 

**Cabinet Minister**: Person is given full control over a Ministry and is eligible to attend cabinet meetings (which is the highest decision-making body of the country).

**Minister of State (Independent Charge)**: Person is given charge over a ministry, but the PMO keeps a close watch on how the ministry is functioning. These ministers are allowed to attend cabinet meetings only if the PM’s permits them to do so.

**Minister of State**: Person is given charge of a specific department or just a part of a Ministry, especially when the Ministry is large (Eg: Home, Defence or Finance). The Cabinet Minister has complete authority to decide what tasks are to be given to the MoS within the Ministry. MoS cannot attend cabinet meetings.

Casual Observation: Out of all those who were sworn in, Arjun Ram Meghwal seemed to have gotten the loudest thumps and cheers. He used to be the Chief Whip of BJP in Lok Sabha and has now been made MoS of Finance. 
Seems like he won’t be able to [bicycle to Parliament anymore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxyz8YASYHk).

Bonus: Here’s the [mother of all government directories](http://goidirectory.nic.in/union_categories.php?ct=E002), in case you want to find out how to reach ministries. This includes state ministries and PSUs as well. Explore away!

#Kashmir Crisis… Bangladeshi Infiltration and Tamil Fishermen
___
Discussions were held in both houses of Parliament regarding the ongoing agitation happening in the Kashmir Valley. While accusations flew thick between the Congress and BJP, regional parties like AIADMK and TMC decided to bring in their own international border issues into the discussion.

Kalyan Banerjee from TMC started speaking about infiltration from Bangladesh to West Bengal when he was interrupted by Ananth Kumar, Minister of Chemicals and Fertilizers. He pointed out the Mr Banerjee was going off topic. 

[Then this happened](http://imgur.com/lWsluww)

You're killin it Khargeji!

AIADMK’s A Anwar Raajhaa (With the kind blessings of [Puruchithalaiva Amma](http://mythicalindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/weird_jayalalitha_fans.jpg)) spoke about Kashmir and then switched to talk about the problem of fishermen in Tamil Nadu who are being harassed by the Sri Lankan Navy. Raanjhaa demanded that this should be declared as a national issue as well.

___
#Parliament resumes, Lok Sabha Adjourns
___
The Parliament was summoned on July 18 for the monsoon session and the news was splattered with headlines like “Parliament resumes, Lok Sabha adjourns”. 

Everyone was like, “What?! Why do these politicians keep disrupting the house? Why don’t these people want to work?” 

Well, they do, but they couldn’t help it this time round.

The adjournment wasn’t because of disruptions, which is usually the cause, but for paying respects to a sitting member of Parliament who passed away. Mr Dalpat Singh Parasate of Shahdol constituency in Madhya Pradesh passed away on June 1 (#RIP). 

It’s a followed practice that in case of the death of a sitting member, Parliament will not transact any business on the first day of sitting as a mark of respect. In case an MP dies while the Parliament is in session, the house is adjourned for the following day. In the Budget session, Mr PA Sangma passed away and a similar adjournment followed. His son Conrad Sangma now occupies his seat of Tura (Meghalaya). 

The first order of business for this session in Lok Sabha was [his swearing in](http://imgur.com/vgFFwdH).

Interestingly enough, Rajya Sabha has decided in May 2016 to [curtail this practice](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rajya-sabha-not-to-adjourn-for-day-if-sitting-member-dies-in-intersession-period/article8672837.ece) if the Member of Parliament passes in the interim period. The upper house will now only adjourn if an MP dies during sessions. Lok Sabha sticks to its ol’ ways. 

___
#Thou Shalt not read out Speeches
___

While giving his speech on the Kashmir crisis, A Anwar Raajhaa of the AIADMK happened to just read it out from a few sheets of paper. He even mixed up the sheets in the middle and went off course a few times. 

Rao Indrajit Singh, MoS of Urban Development, took strong offence and got up to object. He asked the chair to stop him because there is a rule against reading out speeches in the Parliament. Well, he goofed up a little though. The person in the chair was Deputy Speaker Dr M Thambidurai. He’s from the AIADMK.

Thambidurai seemed visibly upset that the chair was being questioned and asked Singh to sit down. Although a lot of the conversation was not put on record, witnesses of LSTV will vouch about the use of the word “he’s speaking nonsense” being thrown around rather loudly. At one point, Mr Singh seemed to have given out the impression to the Deputy Speaker that he was being partial towards his own party member. The otherwise calm and gentle Thambidurai seemed to be visibly upset. 

The funny thing is that this is actually a rule. Rule 352 of the [Procedure and Conduct of Business](http://parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/rules/rules.html) says: 

> “A member while speaking shall not…. (xi) read a written speech except with the previous permission of the Chair.” 

So in this case, there was no clarity whether or not the prior permission of the chair was taken. If only Mr Rao Indrajit Singh quoted the rule number, he might have been able to achieve his objective. 

Mods, pliss to tweet the correct rule to him?

#A few other interesting rules (for teh lulz)

**Rule 349**: Whilst the House is sitting, a member-

(iii) shall bow to the Chair while entering or leaving the House, and also when taking or leaving his seat

I'm not sure what to flair this post as. I'm on a throwaway account that I may or may not continue using and I just want to share my side of the story while I sit here in loneliness watching random videos on Youtube just to get my mind off of things. And with no sign of sleep at all.

>About me & my partners

I'm a late 20s guy who quit his job two years ago and went ahead and jumped into the Indian startup ecosystem to start my business. I'm also a college dropout by choice so I don't have a graduate degree but I really loved the business WE were running. Me along with two of the bestest friends were my partners and I feel responsible for them. One of them quit his safe cushy job when I messaged him at 2am in the morning with my idea and the other one trusted me enough to fund this whole machine. I'm extremely lucky to have these people in my life and I acknowledge that.

>Our Business - What we do

Our business isn't one of those apps or tech related business. We're more into the supply chain and making product sourcing and fulfillment for people in the ecommerce sphere easy. Think of it in a way that I'm sourcing and exporting products that my clients sell on their ecom sites. I loved this because this is something that solved a problem for my own hobby turning it into a full-fledged business and it was also helping me create a legit machine with a brand name that also helped me capture clients.

>How has the lockdown affected my business?

Being a new business we were ALMOST breakeven. Most of the money we were losing was because of bad decisions and mistakes but everyday we were losing less. Also had a bunch of profitable days and weeks which helped us not invest more from our own pockets into the business. We had created a cycle where the money that came in helped us with all the costs.

Me along with the partner who had invested money into the business were not taking out salaries (reason why I said almost breakeven) and I was making sure that the third partner got paid because he left his good job and to assure his family members - remember, we're all in our late 20s. We had also hired some help to help us in the office and with the vendors that we were dealing with. Basically the plan was to spend only when absolutely necessary and while doing it this way we also made sure that we had a life outside of work.

This worked smoothly with some hitches of course.

In January when I read about the first covid-19 case in India, I was scared. Things got bad real soon around the world. With every passing day I was worried more and more about what I was going to do in case our country went into a complete lockdown. I checked and tried to do some analysis in order to see if we can still work it if we do go into the lockdown.

But the fact of the matter is that my business heavily depends on vendors and shipping providers and the latter is out of my control and reach. The main part of this whole thing was shipping which I had taken so much pain to setup.

One thing I learned while doing all this is that there's a reason why India with such manpower and about mediocre infra in our industry isn't able to fulfill even a fraction of the demand. It's because the vendors are lazy. Even if you promise to pay them above the market rate, make payments on time and even help them financially to source the raw materials, they are not willing to work for it. And I'm not talking about overtime or anything.. Just their normal work cycle. They are not serious about it at all.

I had multiple vendors but only one of them worked properly and listened to me when there was an urgency in the order we were giving them. We had this second vendor who just wasn't serious about the work and we were giving them loads of work. Within a month I was their biggest client and they did work properly for the first two months but after that it all went to shit. I couldn't change my vendor because that's a long process of renegotiating and setting everything up which I couldn't do in my volumes which were high.

I wrote all this because when my city got the first few Covid-19 cases, I started urging them to get my work done as soon as possible. We were given assurances, promises, we paid in advance but it all went to shit because now I have an inventory of products that is ready to go but I cannot send them due to the state borders being closed. My shipping company is not able to function and all these need to be sent out of India.

I'm now in a sea of uncertainty where I have to pay my bills, pay my office rent, pay salaries with whatever I have in the business account right now.

>The finances

I'm not even worried about the money, I'm worried about the inventory I have, I'm worried about the payment disputes I need to deal with because these are all orders to be sent outside India. For every payment dispute I lose, I lose $15 extra. The money for the customer acquisition cost is already paid for. The money for the raw materials are to be paid and I'm refunding customers everyday. Losing that customer acquisition amount along with any margin that I might have earned.

>What do I mean exactly? 

Now, I'm all for Life>Money but as a small businessman who has been thinking, living, breathing his business all the time for months and years, I'm going insane. I'm having panic attacks, I don't know what I will do next. I used to have a plan for everything, now I don't. I'm not able to let this go and this pain is almost physical now. My head hurts all the time, I sleep for a few hours and when I wake up my eyes are still red and they feel as if they're burning.

I'm also sure that there are businesses out there that are into deeper shit than I am but that in my own opinion shouldn't be a comfort for me. I'm not sadistic.

I have no savings, my company is running out of money, there are people who need to be paid, employees to pay and a partner who invested with trust and is now seeing the money disappear into thin air daily - he's a kind soul and hasn't said a single word for it yet.

But I feel responsible and I'm not able to calm down. Anxiety is on its peak for me right now and I have no plans to save us from this.

I come to this sub daily and I actively participate in discussions and disses but I haven't seen anything about small business people here and just wanted to tell my side of the story.

I'm scared guys, I'm not even religious and can just hope that the govt. probably is thinking of exporters in this scenario to maybe help us in this situation.

I'm wishing you all good health and please stay inside.

I'm going to try and sleep now. Thank you for reading this."

*“The world’s richest people are instead turning to countries like Dubai, Qatar and Singapore to house their assets as Switzerland loses its allure as a haven.”* -  Billionaire Gopichand Hinduja of the Hinduja family group that owns Ashok Leyland and IndusInd Bank among other companies, [commenting](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-07-26/billionaire-hinduja-sees-switzerland-losing-luster-for-wealthy) on the fall of Switzerland as tax haven. That’s right. Switzerland ain’t got nothing on Qatar.

**Big Oil To Get Fatter**

One of the ideas being thrown around to deal with the bad loans crisis was merging all 27 state-owned banks to make 6 really huge banks. Taking inspiration from that idea, the government is now throwing around another idea - [merging](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/government-set-to-start-talks-on-merging-13-state-oil-companies-to-create-behemoth/articleshow/53371857.cms) 13 big state-owned oil companies to make 1 really huge oil company. Companies like ONGC, Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum lead the list of the 13 companies being considered for this mega-merger. Even as oil prices nearly committed suicide last year, just the top 6 state-owned oil companies still managed to report revenues of ₹9.3 trillions. So clearly, the 1 giant oil company that will come out of these mergers will be big enough to rival the likes of UK’s BP and Russia’s Rosneft. But it will still be a few ranks smaller than some of the biggest oil companies in the world. And at least when it comes to business, size does matter. This idea of merging oil companies isn’t a new idea - it’s been brought up and shot down numerous times in the past mainly due to concerns over reduced competition. Mergers are extra difficult for government companies because after every merger, there’s some extra fat that you have to trim. But government companies tend to focus on social welfare before profit - which means keeping that extra fat to pump up employment in the country. Even if the prospect of this 1 giant oil company with trillions in revenue seems huge right now, rest assured, it won’t be bigger than *yo mama*.

**Gone Are The Days Of Jabong**

The e-commerce industry made multiple headlines last week - the biggest story being the acquisition of Jabong. Flipkart-owned Myntra went shopping around for companies and [dropped](https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/25/rocket-internets-jabong-sold-to-flipkart-owned-rival-myntra-for-70m/) $70 million on Jabong, creating the largest online fashion company. The second-highest bidder for Jabong was Snapdeal which offered $50 million followed by Future Group (that owns the Big Bazaar stores) which offered $35 million. It’s been a tough couple of years for Jabong. Even Amazon, the 800-pound gorilla of the e-commerce business, briefly considered acquiring Jabong for $1 billion back in 2014. Compared to that price tag, Flipkart got a nice discount of 93%. However, the days aren’t as rosy as they sound for Flipkart. Exhibit A - the company just [fired](http://profit.ndtv.com/news/start-ups/article-flipkart-to-lay-off-hundreds-of-underperforming-employees-report-1437780) about 700 employees and tried to play it off as “a fairly common practice”. Exhibit B - Industry reports released last week indicate that Amazon has [surpassed](http://www.firstpost.com/business/most-consumers-preferred-amazon-over-flipkart-for-online-transactions-in-2016-says-survey-2915798.html) Flipkart to become India’s preferred online destination. Exhibit C - Snapdeal reached 1 million daily transacting users, more than those of Flipkart and Amazon put together. Seems like bad news does come in threes.

**RIO MMXVI**

The 2016 Olympic Games are set to begin next week in Brazil. As the media begins extensive coverage of the events, get ready for the millions of Indians that will be shocked to find out about the existence of sports other than cricket and fighting trolls online. Just as the international media came at India with pitchforks drawn for botching up the 2010 Commonwealth Games, let’s turn those pitchforks around and poke other countries for mismanaging international sporting events. The host nation, Brazil is going through its worst economic crisis since 1930 and its worst health crisis since 1918. The country’s GDP contracted by 4% in 2015, and is expected to [contract](http://www.pri.org/stories/2016-02-22/budget-rio-olympics-16-times-higher-budget-combat-zika-virus) by another 3% in 2016. Plus there’s the small matter of Zika viruses roaming around giving birth defects to unborn babies. Technically, the country doesn’t have a President since the most recent one was suspended under charges of corruption. Considering all of that, just the fact that Brazil hasn’t descended into anarchy is an achievement. The government has allocated $9.7 billion for the Olympic Games, which is 16 times more than the budget allocated to deal with the Zika virus that has already infected 1.5 million Brazilians. Hashtag Priorities. However, every Olympic Game since 1968 has exceeded its budget by an average of 179% which means that $9.7 billion could very well balloon up to $17 billion. Godspeed Brazil, godspeed.

**News Flash: Old Age Is Tough**

Most people’s idea of preparing for retirement includes investing in 1) Fixed Deposits, 2) Mutual Funds or 3) A kid or two. But a survey by the investment bank HSBC [found](http://zeenews.india.com/business/news/finance/47-indians-not-saving-for-retirement-hsbc_1908299.html) that 47% of the working people in India haven’t even started saving for retirement. No need to panic - the global average is around the same at 46% - so the rest of the world is as deep in this swamp as India. The HSBC survey also found the 80% of Indians seek advice about retirement from friends and family - which basically means that your primary source of information about retirement is that one balding uncle you have who walks around with a beer belly and midlife crisis. That’s just one survey. Here’s another - the annual Global Retirement Index published by Natixis, one of the biggest asset management companies in France, [ranked](http://qz.com/737382/india-is-the-worst-place-in-the-world-to-retire-2/) India as the 43rd best country to retire. That doesn’t seem so bad until you realize that the Index only tracks 43 countries to begin with, and India finished last. Dispelling any notions that India finished last due to all the nice guys in the country, the index mentioned the pitiful state of India’s healthcare system as one of the reasons that we finished last. Meanwhile, Norway and Switzerland were ranked as the best places to retire.

This year, understanding the need of promoting water  conservation, rainwater harvesting and plantation, Fiinovation through  its CSR-CSO Partnership practice assisted Uflex and Aroh Foundation in  implementation of CSR initiatives in the national capital region. The  project will be carried out for the next three years where the capacity  of the local communities will be build to conserve and optimize the  natural resource base.

The project is being funded by Uflex which is one of the largest  flexible packaging company in India. Aroh Foundation is engaged in  implementation of the project and have been chosen for the same after  thorough scrutiny of credibility and previous experience of similar  projects.

The Uflex project is being implemented in two villages of Gautam  Budhha Nagar and is estimated to benefit more than 400 farmers. The  project will involve construction of in-situ and ex-situ rainwater  harvesting structures to address the water scarcity concerns of the  people. Aroh Foundation is known for their work in the social  development and environment restoration and will help the farmers build  field bunds and farm ponds to arrest rain water. The project will also  include organic and inorganic mulching to protect the degrading top soil  and plantation drive.

Other aspect of the project is the horticulture production which  shall be grown in the community and individually owned land. The  specific activities will be beneficial for the livestock also due to  availability of fodder all year round in the implementation area. The  farmers will also benefit from the plants bearing fruits.

[Fiinovation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxro9bso574)  expects that the project will increase the ground water levels due to  increased percolation and therefore, there will be better availability  of water for domestic and agricultural use. There are plans for  implementation of similar water conservation projects across India,  especially the drought hit regions. Today, such initiatives are not only  beneficial for the farmers but has become a necessity. It is inspiring  to see corporations such as Uflex investing their CSR funds towards  environment conservation and sustainable development.

Let us hope that through the water conservation projects, India will  be able to resolve the water crisis in  future. Fiinovation urge  corporations to focus on partnerships for implementation of similar CSR  initiatives."

Business/Finance,In need of urgent advice regarding career! Please help.,"Hi,

I am a 25 year old Indian national living in Thailand with my family. I did my undergrad in Thailand in BBA in Finance. After that I joined my family trading business of loose diamonds. After a year in the business, I joined a Thailand based diamond jewelry export company (owned by an Indian-American). 

I am working in the jewelry company for the past two years but since I am the youngest I am given odd works. I am being paid 55,000 baht per month (after tax). 

I was wondering what my options for a secure future are? I am starting to get complacent in my job - getting comfortable with my monthly salary which I do not want. If I get fired or if I want to switch my job, I do not feel I have enough skills to get an equivalent salary. 

Another issue is that the jewelry industry is shrinking. I am also not sure if I enjoy the industry as much. I have a few options in mind but opinions are needed. My options are -
1. CFA
2. MBA
3. Starting a business

I am so confused in life about my career that I hate even thinking about it. My work timings are 8:30 am to 6:30 pm (Mon-Fri). Saturdays I work 8:30 am to 12:00 pm.

I have around 10 lakh baht saved since I live with my family. But we do not have any asset - no house, car, etc.

Please help.

Edit - For MBA, I would love to go to the Western countries or India - wouldn't do it in Thailand. I do not mind shifting back to India if required. My family is not very well off. My parents do not have a lot of money save for their retirement."

Jagdish Pathak

There are more than one million Indian-origin immigrants in Canada. But compared to rising number of Indian-origin immigrants, Indian investment has not kept pace in Canada. However, slowly but steadily, Indian investments are trickling into the Canadian economy. Economic stability has become key to Canada's success and is decisive in attracting investors from all over the world to its shores. Investment in Canada is considered a safe haven for investors' hard-earned money and continues to represent a solid foundation for future growth and prosperity. 

Canada is the No. 1 investment destination in the G7 and was ranked 4th in the world as the best country to conduct business over the period 2010-14, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit's Business Environment Ranking August 2010 report. 

Indian investors have still been shy about investing in Canada. Most investors from India prefer the UK and Europe as well as the countries of the Middle East, historically. Outside this region, Indian investments are scattered and limited. Canada is a stable, secure nation, and endowed with abundant natural resources. Its currency has always been very stable and its safest borders are with the largest economy of the world. Canada/US relations can be described as the best that any two nations can have. 

Canada ranks 27th in terms of FDI investment in India and its investments are mostly in the development sector. Whereas Indian FDI approved until 2009 in Canada is restricted to $570 million and ranks as the 20th destination of Indian investments. 

Recently, in Windsor, I saw a big hoarding on the road showing the name ""Aditya Birla"" on it. I stopped and looked at it with admiration, thinking, at last, Indian investors have made up their mind to make Canada their destination for good. 

Indian investors should consider Canada and especially the province of Ontario to be the hub of their North American business activities. Ontario has liberal laws, a huge existing infrastructure, and various tax benefits to investors, relatively milder climate, fertile farmlands and, without doubt, some of the best golf courses in the world in your neighborhood. 

People here are well aware of Indian investments in the automotive sector of the UK. During the purchasing phase of the Jaguar and Land Rover deal by Tata, India and its investors were commonly discussed in Ontario bars and restaurants. Ontario is the hub of automotive industries and support services for manufacturing automobiles of big-3: US and Japanese car manufacturers like Honda and Toyota. Southwestern Ontario is a key entry point for US and South American markets. 

Canadians are very knowledgeable about India and its information technology-related successes. India is no longer a nation of beggars and snake- charmers in the minds of a younger generation of Canadian citizens. Growth of the Indian software industry has made a big mark on the Canadian psyche. 

Any investment in Canada will have to be planned over the long term similar to US investors in the past. Canadian oil and energy, forestry, mines and minerals, and gold and diamond resources are some of the best resources for investors to look at. The Canadian higher education system is one of the best in the world and at par with the US, resulting in students from across the globe studying and performing high quality research. 

Investors from India are relatively conservative by nature and prefer to satisfy some critical marks before deciding to invest. Canada is one such country which should be the destination of long-term investors from India. One might look at some of the investments made by Indian investors in the Ontario province and think how much is there on offer in this well-endowed province alone. Investments by Essar group in energy and steel, by Mahindra Satyam and Wipro in the IT sector are a good beginning. However, the quantity of investment is negligible, compared to China, which is making substantial investment in the core sectors of oil and energy, solar and wind power generation and forestry. 

A strategic investment in developed nations like Canada goes with the Indian aspiration of becoming a global power. Indian investors can fulfill such desires in conjunction with the geo-political leadership potential of India.

Business/Finance,I am forwarding an interesting story about world economy. How valid is it? I leave it to you. Another whatsapp forward,"Amazing logic indeed. This is a crazy world! Interesting article written by an Indian Economist

Japanese save a lot. They do not spend much. Also, Japan exports far more than it imports. Has an annual trade surplus of over 100 billion. Yet Japanese economy is considered weak, even collapsing.

Americans spend, save little. Also US imports more than it exports.
Has an annual trade deficit of over $400 billion. Yet, the American economy is considered strong and trusted to get stronger.

But where from do Americans get money to spend? They borrow from Japan, China and even India.
Virtually others save for the US to spend. Global savings are mostly invested in US, in dollars.

India itself keeps its foreign currency assets of over $50 billion in US securities. China has sunk over $160 billion in US securities.
Japan's stakes in US securities is in trillions.

Result:
The US has taken over $5 trillion from the world. So, as the world
saves for the US - It's The Americans who spend freely. Today, to keep the US consumption going, that is for the US economy to work, other
countries have to remit $180 billion every quarter, which is $2
billion a day, to the US!

A Chinese economist asked a neat question. Who has invested more, US in China, or China in US? The US has invested in China less than half of what China has invested in US.

The same is the case with India. It have invested in US over $50
billion. But the US has invested less than $20 billion in India.

Why the world is after US?

The secret lies in the American spending, that they hardly save. In fact they use their credit cards to spend their future income. That the US spends is what makes it attractive to export to the US. So US imports more than what it exports year after year.

The result:

The world is dependent on US consumption for its growth. By its deepening culture of consumption, the US has habituated the world to
feed on US consumption. But as the US needs money to finance its consumption, the world provides the money.

It's like a shopkeeper providing the money to a customer so that the customer keeps buying from the shop. If the customer will not buy, the shop won't have business, unless the shopkeeper funds him. The US is like the lucky customer. And the world is like the helpless shopkeeper
financier.

Who is America's biggest shopkeeper financier? Japan of course. Yet it's Japan which is regarded as weak. Modern economists complain that
Japanese do not spend, so they do not grow. To force the Japanese to spend, the Japanese government exerted itself, reduced the savings
rates, even charged the savers. Even then the Japanese did not spend (habits don't change, even with taxes, do they?). Their traditional postal savings alone is over $1.2 trillion. Thus, savings, far from being the strength of Japan, has become its pain.

Hence, what is the lesson?

That is, a nation cannot grow unless the people spend, not save. Not just spend, but borrow and spend.
Dr. Jagdish Bhagwati, the famous Indian-born economist in the US, told Manmohan Singh that Indians wastefully save. Ask them to spend, on imported cars and, seriously, even on cosmetics! This will put India on a growth curve. This is one of the reason for MNC's coming down to India, seeing the consumer spending.

'Saving is sin, and spending is virtue.'
But before you follow this Neo Economics, get some fools to save so that you can borrow from them and spend !!!

[Minimum Income Guarantee](https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/congress-beats-bjp-to-income-guarantee-plan-but-leaves-math-to-manifesto)

[AOC's 70% Marginal Tax Rate](https://nowthisnews.com/videos/politics/alexandria-ocasio-cortezs-70-marginal-tax-rate-isnt-that-radical)

When we were born as a republic and our Constitution was being drafted, one of the tallest leaders of the land could foresee the problem we ail with even today. BR Ambedkar warned us about a divide and that divide was not just of caste but of rich and poor. The recent Oxfam Report on Inequality in India is a testament to that. Somewhere along the line we have failed to bridge that divide.

We have progressed, indubitably but failed to progress collectively. Poverty and hunger still ails the weakest among us. I remember watching one video of Raghav Bahl where he mentioned how India, as a mixed economy have actually got the worst of both worlds. Ours is not a **capitalist economy** and even with Indira's 42nd amendment, it isn't a **socialist economy** either.

I am not a Rahul fanboy, I supported Modi and voted for BJP but I concur with Rahul's tweet when he announces MIG and says 'we cannot build a new India while millions of our brothers & sisters suffer the scourge of poverty.'

While all this is happening in India, in the west, USA, the Democrats are making a comeback, they have recently won back the House with their diverse bunch of Reps and are putting a leash on their meglomaniac President. The hotly debated topic and the eyesore for Fox News being? AOC's 70% Marginal Tax Rate on which she campaigned and won and will probably take it forward.

All these three events are happening at the same time and I do not see why we are not having this debate in India. Our divide is only growing and we cannot collectively grow until we take care of the poor and weakened ones. Here is an interesting statistic!

I do understand when you say that Ambani (or other ultra rich people) have notional wealth because it lies in stocks. This is a very capitalistic thought and factually correct but at the same time, incomplete. Ambani's wealth lies in RIL's stocks but, **STOCKS PAY DIVIDENDS**! Ambani, according to [this report](https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/mukesh-ambanis-dividend-income-from-reliance-industries-trumps-his-salary), **made Rs 14,553 crore in dividend through his stake in the company over the last 10 years** and  **Rs 1,804 crore in 2018 alone** and that with **a salary of Rs 15 crore annually**.

A rough calculation on Google's currency converter would tell you that **he can finance like two more $100 million weddings with the payout of 2018 ALONE**! So don't talk to me about the concept of notional wealth and how if he starts liquidate, RIL stocks would crash, a common and idiotic argument.

So yeah, we cannot build a new India while millions of our brothers and sisters suffer the scourge of poverty and MIG is sure as hell seems a nice idea (not talking about execution right now) and taxing the ultra rich like AOC says cannot be ruled out in India as well. This is India, we have a probe on Mars while we rank 103 of 119 countries in Global Hunger Index, the divide is real.

I am writing down all this because there **needs to be a debate** on this in India as well. The tax plan may just as well be a way to finance UBI or MIG in India but let's talk policy and make a buzz about this.

Lastly, here's a nice tweet from AOC on her idea of income inequality which I absolutely love. [Somewhere between “teachers shouldn’t have to sell their own blood to make rent” & “billionaires with helipads and full-time workers on food stamps shouldn’t exist in the same society”](https://twitter.com/aoc/status/1085293594603339776?lang=en)"

**Banks - Mo’ Money, No Problems**

Two major private sector banks, Axis and HDFC, reported results for the quarter ending June and it’s a mixed bag. The bad loans crisis [continued](http://www.financialexpress.com/industry/banking-finance/axis-bank-q1-results-net-profit-bad-loans-on-july-22-2016/325755/) to hit Axis Bank where profits fell by 21%. But HDFC Bank, which mostly focuses on retail borrowers, [managed](http://in.reuters.com/article/hdfc-bank-results-idINKCN1010ML) to entirely miss the crisis as profits were up by 20%. However, the bag isn’t so mixed when it comes to public sector banks which are riddled with problems. The government’s got 99 problems, and 98 of them probably involve the banking sector in one way or another. Now, one way to solve problems is to just throw money at the problem. And 13 public sector banks just [received](http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/govt-allocates-rs-22915-cr-for-psu-bank-re-capitalization_7065221.html) about ₹22,915 crore of cash from the government. A back of the envelope calculation says if they had delivered all that cash physically, it would weigh about 275 kgs. Yes, I did the math. After reserving a lot of money to treat the bad loans problem, the banks didn’t have much remaining to lend out to borrowers. And if banks stop lending money, the entire economy grinds to a halt. So the new capital given by the government is supposed to help them get back into the lending game again. The largest recipient of this capital infusion was our largest bank, the State Bank of India that got about ₹7,575 crore. However, this is only a “capital infusion” and definitely not a “bailout”. Who even said bailout? There’s no bailout here. What bailout?

**ELI5 - GST**

GST - You know it’s a thing. But you don’t have a single clue what it’s about. The only time you hear about it is while changing channels on the TV. And from your drunk uncle at wedding receptions who thinks he’s an expert in politics. The Goods and Services Tax is probably the most important tax reform of this decade. It replaces a whole bunch of indirect taxes such as the VAT, Service Tax or Excise Duty. So instead of paying ten taxes at ten places, you only pay one tax at one place. And cutting down on that paperwork starts a domino effect of good things for the economy. At least that’s the theory. But the bill has been stuck in Rajya Sabha for a long time now. So what’s the big hold up? Political parties have been negotiating the finer details of the bill and the negotiations are taking a little more time than everybody expected. Some sore points of disagreement are whether to place a maximum limit of 18% above which the GST tax rate cannot be raised, whether to levy a 1% surcharge on interstate trade and how to resolve any disputes in the process. But now, if you feel like you aren’t getting enough of our beloved parliamentarians that are so hard at work solving our problems in penthouses all around Delhi, then fear no more. Because the government is [planning](http://zeenews.india.com/news/india/gst-hopes-brighten-as-congress-signals-support-bjp-ready-for-debate-in-rajya-sabha_1908866.html) a 5-hour-long debate in the Rajya Sabha aiming to resolve all disputes and pass the bill once and for all. That’s right, back to back five hours of bickering old men in white clothes - without any commercial breaks.

**Tesla to go desi?**

The pollution in Delhi has reached such an alarming level that if a Delhi resident starts smoking 10 packs of cigarettes a day and garnishing his food with powered nicotine while sleeping in a chamber full of passive tobacco smoke, he’ll probably still die of asthma from the polluted air before the lung cancer gets to him. And then there’s Delhi CM Mr. Kejriwal who recently hinted at the possibility of the torturous odd-even rule returning back to Delhi during the upcoming winters to curb pollution. What the city clearly needs is a whole bunch of emission-free electric cars. And accordingly, the government’s making moves to get Tesla, the car company famous for its electric cars to come to India. Apart from offering to promote joint ventures between Tesla and Indian car companies, the government is even [offering](http://tech.firstpost.com/news-analysis/tesla-and-make-in-india-a-roadway-to-cleaner-and-greener-india-but-how-soon-326205.html) Tesla land near major ports so it can Make in India and export to other Asian countries as well. However, the pipe dream of driving a Tesla down the national highways is unlikely to come true for at least a few years. Until then, we’ve got to find other ways to reduce pollution. Such as banning all diesel vehicles older than 10 years, which is what the National Green Tribunal just did. NGT, a top environmental court, has [directed](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-autos-court-idUSKCN0ZY12P) Delhi transport authorities to de-register any diesel vehicles older than 10 years, and car companies couldn’t be happier.

~~**Tollywoodonomics**~~  **Kollywoodonomics**

Rajinikanth, the Amitabh Bachchan of the South, was out with his latest movie *Kabali*, which opened last Friday in 6,500 theaters, many of which were sold out for the entire weekend. In the movie industry, you’re only as good as your last flop - and in Rajini’s case, his last movie was *Lingaa* and before that, *Kochadaiiyaan* - both of which - well, let's just say that they haven’t exactly been Spielberg material. So you’d think producers would think twice before betting on this next film - but this Rajini we are talking about. He doesn’t follow the laws of economics. The laws of economics follow Ra... okay, yeah, those jokes stopped being funny 10 years ago. But still, people literally pour milk on huge cutouts of this guy. So producers went all in and funded Kabali with a budget of ₹110 crore. Here’s the kicker - the movie had already [earned](http://www.firstpost.com/bollywood/how-rajinikanths-kabali-has-earned-rs-200-crore-days-before-its-release-2902140.html) ₹200 crore even before being released. Music rights, overseas rights, satellite rights and all other kinds of rights had already earned the movie a ton of cash before being released. How much did Rajini make off the movie? The actor was reportedly [paid](http://www.catchnews.com/regional-cinema/revealed-this-is-how-much-rajinikanth-charged-for-kabali-movie-news-rajinikanth-kabali-fees-revealed-1469024603.html) ₹35 crore as acting fees plus he’s set to receive another ₹45 crore from first week collections of the movie at the box office. Rajini being Rajini, theaters were sold out but prices for tickets in black ranged up to ₹1,500 with reports saying fans were ready to pay as much as ₹5,000 for tickets. All of this only points to one thing - at 65-years old, Rajini’s still got some swag.

* The latest version of Fortune magazine’s famous list of 500 top companies in the world was published last week. While the list features companies that are the crème de la crème of the world’s companies, much like the Olympic medal rankings, it is dominated by western multinationals with a few Indian companies here and there. Specifically, seven Indian companies. But the three top [ranked](https://www.scoopwhoop.com/These-Are-The-Seven-Indian-Which-Companies-Which-Made-It-To-Fortune-500-List/) are - Indian Oil (161st), Reliance (215th) and Tata Motors (226th).

For this exact purpose, Amazon acquired Emvantage, Snapdeal owns Freecharge and Paytm is a digital payment franchise in itself. So, of course Flipkart would want it’s own toy to play with. After acquiring PhonePe (a payments startup) this April, Flipkart is [investing](http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2016/07/21/why-flipkart-is-building-a-670-crore-digital-payments-business/) an additional ₹670 crore in the company which is expected to start processing digital payments on Flipkart, Myntra and its logistics service, eKart in the next few weeks.

The company is set to [make](http://in.reuters.com/article/icici-prudential-ipo-idINKCN0ZY0EL) records by raising over ₹5,000 crore in what will be the biggest IPO in six years. Other notable IPOs of the year include L&T Infotech and Vodafone.

* The long-standing drought has hit rural India the hardest where villagers are being forced to cut back on expenses. Reports suggest that rural India has [elected](http://www.thequint.com/india/2016/07/12/not-all-is-cool-with-the-cola-phone-companies-are-pleased-though-rural-india-coca-cola-pepsico-telecom-companies) to cut expenses by not buying things like cola, candy, biscuits and chocolates. However, mobile internet packs have stood the test of drought to become best-sellers across rural India. Which, I believe, can be taken as conclusive evidence that even farmers in far-reaching corners of rural India love browsing aww-worthy cat photos on the internet. Meanwhile, Coca-Cola, the hardest hit company, is wiping its tears of sadness with the $1.4 billion it earned in profits just last quarter.

###Footnote Stories
***
High inflation is one of the worst things that can happen to the Indian middle class. As in the type of middle class that earns way less than ₹1.6 lakhs per month. There’s food inflation, price inflation, fuel inflation, netflix is raising prices.. And now, there’s pocket money inflation. A 29-city survey of nearly 7,000 kids aged between 4 to 14 and their parents [reveals](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/spend/kids-pocket-money-up-100-since-2012-turner-international-india-study/articleshow/53238075.cms) that the average pocket money given to kids has shot up by 100% since 2012, and currently stands at ₹555 per month.  

If the Gods know everything in the universe, supposedly they would also know about things like earnings per share or book value vs. market value, which would make them great investors. Last week, the famous Siddhivinayak Temple in Mumbai announced that it has [started](http://www.livemint.com/Money/DaYZSn2IV92xn094xuZsTP/Mumbais-Siddhivinayak-Temple-will-take-shares-as-donations.html) accepting shares of listed companies, mutual fund units and bonds as donations, instead of the usual cash or gold/silver. The temple receives about ₹75 crore of donations in cash and kind annually, which is entirely tax-free. Now, Lord Shiva isn’t just the destroyer of the worlds, he might even be a shareholder of Infosys.

Business/Finance,Need leads for website designing/developing,"Hi Folks,

&amp;#x200B;

Need help with website designing.

The idea is to create a website(say something like TheKen or Mark[Manson.net](https://Manson.net)) where 10% of the articles are free and he rest is for subscribed members.

One is to create on Wordpress, using Memberpress (not sure if it works in India). But still, the designing would have to be done by someone more experienced. Other would be to build it entirely from scratch which would give more freedom but with high TAT.

&amp;#x200B;

Please help me with someone/some agency who can do a good job.

And what is the price that is generally charged for this kind of service ?

&amp;#x200B;

Help is appreciated."
Business/Finance,Restauranteurs and small Business owners of r/India: I'm a college student trying to start a Milkshake and smoothie Kiosk Business along with my Friend.,"Hello! I'm new to the Business world and have no prior experience in this field. I'm looking to start a Milkshake Kiosk Business in our home state. We identified our location and analyzed all parameters for maximum sales. We have the Investment capital with us.  But we can't be physically present at the Kiosk at all times.

Kindly suggest and advice me on What Business systems and practices should I establish in order to run the small business successfully without needing to be physically present. Thank you!!

Edit: Please take into consideration that there's very high demand for Milkshakes/smoothies/juices in the city we're trying to setup the business. 

The location we chose is an awesome place where there are 2 schools and a University and also high urban population. There exists no competition for this sector right now in that location, so we'll be the first to setup a Milkshake/Smoothie Kiosk."

Anyways, illusion of free market with free flow of capital/finance, IPR, workers and commodities is not working globally. Free flow of workers is catalyst for anti-immigration movement.

Absurd that IAS lobby under Modi has left everything including job creation to free market. Even climate change mitigation left to free market.

I have also flunked in few subjects in my 5th sem for which I am busy giving re-exams so I'm not able to focus on admissions and before I realised the last date for admission has already passed for most of the colleges across India. The only hopes I have are with MS university Baroda (where I did my B.Com Honours) where I am sure to get admission but it's not very reputable. Or Indian School of Business and Finance Delhi where the admissions are still open. But the problem with ISBF is that they are only offering PG diploma courses (1 year courses) and the fees are expensive af (2.5k admission fee and 5.1 lakh annual fee for just one year). Also there is a lot of competition for admission and I have to give an entrance test and personal interview. My options seem to be shrinking by the minute and I don't know what to do. My parents are dead against me taking a year's gap and bugging me night and day for flunking in my 5th sem exam. What I need is genuine advice and a little support, something am not getting at all.

Questions Public wants answers for -



ENVIRONMENT

Our verbal commitment to SDGs are contrary to the ground realities. Why?


We need many more NGT benches. Do we have enough competent lawyers to occupy those benches?


With the National Clean Energy FUnd now be used to compensate States for the losses due to GST, what is the Govt's plan to fund its environment and climate actions now?


Why has the government backed away from the EV policy? 


Why regulations around sale and use of pet coke have been relaxed?

 
What is the status of the Waste Segregation and City Compost Policy under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan which were supposed to be taken up in 2017?


Sustainable solutions for agriculture, waste management, pollution ++ do not cost much. Why can’t the bureaucracy look at such solutions?


Why not learn from China, how it brought down pollution in Beijing during the last few years?




FARMERS AND AGRARIAN DISTRESS


Quote
Indian farmers have, for long, ensured that the country does not face any food shortage. The time has finally come for the PM to declare: “I am confident Indian farmers can feed the nation, I annul the Essential Commodities Act”. The most critical reform to revolutionise Indian agriculture requires no money. It requires something far harder to acquire — learning to unlearn yesterday’s wisdom.
Unquote


You ride on seaplane during Gujarat election, didn't left enough water for irrigation in Narmada dam. Why?
Today coastal Saurashtra is in submerged condition, forget about sea plane there isn't enough life savings boat, how can you afford seaplane?


Agreed the sardar sarovar dam is finished, But when will you actually complete the entire project? More than 50,000km of sub canal work is pending!


What is the status of the new crop insurance scheme? How much premiums were paid and what is the payout to farmers?


How many marginal farmers who were not earlier given loans by institutional finance been brought into institutional finance instead of loan sharks



FINANCE



Who IS the FM? 


Why the hell is Aadhaar, which was initially implemented for granting govt benefits directly to the people being used as an identity card now and being forced to link with banks and mobile numbers (Even when proved that it is not unique nor safely guarded)?

What was the actual purpose of demonetisation ? Did it yield any results? How much effective was it in combating counterfeit currency and curbing terrorism? Why does RBI takes so much time to count all the notes?
Why petrol not included in the GST?


Why Alcohol not included in the GST?


How this government understand the final effect/result of any project they rollout.(e.g Jan Dhan/ Ganga /Demonetization / etc)


Do they really care about ground reality, if yes then please tell the procedure? 


Do they have any deadline to get the feedback / Complete the process.



EDUCATION



Why was autonomous status forced down on Universities?


Do you have a good word or not on the changes brought about in Delhi schools by a different govt?


The commitment to IoE has come down from 20000cr to just 3000cr. Why?


Why is there an urgency to bring in the No Detention policy, without setting up a proper lower education infrastructure where the teachers are asked not only to teach but sent on census duty and election duty etc?'


Why is only 3% of the budget being concentrated on the education? Why haven't you shared the cess collected in the development of the schools? 


Research fellows from IIT will be paid Rs. 70000 as stipend. Why not extend this from other institutions too? For instance, JRFs are given Rs. 25k, SRF’s Rs. 28k and RA’s Rs. 35k-40k


How difficult is it to disburse Central government fellowships to research students on time? Even with the DBT scheme in place, why are research students not receiving fellowship money for 10 months?


What about Jio University? Which factors indicated it to be ranked as an eminent institute?


JOBS



If the Hon PM is so concerned about the lack of data on jobs, then why was the annual labour survey of employment -unemployment discontinued on his watch after 2016?


Experts in the field of solid waste management know that the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan can become the biggest employer, and solve several issues. But state govts and municipalities continue their nexus with contractors who charge astronomical sums for waste-handling equipment and for transportation of waste. Why is a well-intended mission being defeated by the (lower) bureaucracy? Civic action groups must be involved.


New pension scheme: Is it a good idea to link pensions to the stock market?


Elections and funding for parties


How are the retrospective amendments to FCRA wrt political contributions tenable?


What is the sense behind having a non-transparent electoral bond mechanism for donating to Political parties?


Why did you allow the secrecy in election bond ? And by keeping it known to bank govt have direct control on data.




ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY



See for example the ""National Voluntary Guidelines on Social, Environmental and Economic Responsibilities of Business"". http://www.mca.gov.in/Ministry/pdf/DraftNationalGuidelines2018_20062018.pdf


Question: Do the #NVGs (National Voluntary Guidelines) apply to banks? And the Government itself? Our govts are unable to ensure compliance to mandatory laws. How will the #NVGs work out?


The PM speaks of combating corruption, Then why the electoral bonds and Removing provisions of RTI, which kills the transparency all the more?

Where is the data on demonetization and its effects (both positive and negative)?


Why did gov legalise foreign funding of political parties? That too retrospectively?


Why isnt any serious action taken on Panama Papers, where a country like pakistan can send their ex pm to jail for it?




Q) Does Modi and people in his party think all people are idiots? Serious Question since they keep on barking on without facts or figures and just talks as the teenage me fighting against my parents talking random shit that doesn’t matter in the context.


--There are still a lot of people who still support modi even after seeing the evidences. They are mostly carried by the Hindutva narrative.( And these are educated people working in very big MNCs, living in metro cities)


Modi should answer the priority his government has given to basic education in government schools, employment opportunities and healthcare facilities?

What’s the current status on the Uniform Civil Code?



FEDERAL DEMOCRACY


1. It is obvious that a number of states with different parties in power are doing some things right, going by the positive outcomes. Federal Democracy is here to stay. But the needs of citizens within different states are quite different. Respect regional aspirations. One size cannot fit all, ever, in India, or elsewhere.


2. Why is the gov increasingly taking democratic institutions for granted? Ex: using governor states to boss around in the administrative matter of state government. Ex: tamilnadu, new delhi, puducherry, karnataka.



HEALTH CARE



Why does the government not take inspiration from NHS scheme in the UK (which provides efficient and great healthcare to UK residents)?


Why does the gov not allocating enough budget for health care despite india ranking low in HDI even with our neighbours countries ?




OTHER



Is it unparliamentary to hug someone in parliament as suggested by Bhupendra Chaubey?


Why are ministers with unscientific viewpoint still given cabinet portfolios?


Why does government not invest in Cyber Security like other major countries like China, Russia and USA? Our government websites and databases are not fully secured (as evident from data being accessed by fs0ciety from AP govt. website) We have great Security Engineers, but they are all employed in Private Sector.


Why was AAP asked to repay the amount they spent from government treasury on advertisement, but BJP keeps plastering Modi’s photo everyday in the newspapers and online advertisement (nearly Rs 4600 crores) without any repercussions?

Business/Finance,TL;DR – Godman to Tycoon – The Untold Story of Baba Ramdev,"Context – Yesterday in a thread I happened to mention reading this book and a few redditors had suggested doing a TL;DR of the book once I am finished. 

On the onset if you have the time and resources, I would highly recommend reading the book. It’s published by Juggernaut and is available for reading on their app at Rs. 80. I have read a few biographies and they can often go either way. This is one of few good biographies I have read, partly due to the Caravan Magazine style free flow writing rather than meandering on author’s perceptions and also because the subject (Baba Ramdev) is a fascinating and an intriguing person. It took me three days and essentially three sittings to complete it. The author – Priyanka Pathak Narain is a journalist who used to cover the religion and spirituality section for Mint and that is where she begins on this journey. As part of the book she has interviewed over 52 subjects including Balakrishna – Ramdev’s deputy and owner of 94% of shares of Patanjali Ayurveda Ltd. 

So here we go

* Baba Ramdev (Ram Kisan Yadav) was born in Said Alipur in a poor farming family. A sickly child he rather became very obese and was a victim to his father’s frequent violent outbursts. 

* Somewhere in his early 20s, he finds a band of Arya Samaj workers and is immediately drawn to them. He joined Khanpur gurukul where he learnt Sanskrit grammar, tended cows, collected alms and met his future deputy-to-be Acharya Balakrishna

* Balakrishna is quite into Ayurveda and is from Haridwar where he befriends **Acharya Karamveer** – a stoic, soft spoken Arya Samaj member who had three post graduate degrees in Yoga, Indian Philosophy and Vedas. Karamveer soon takes Balakrishna under his wing and soon Ramdev joins them after a controversy.

* Ramdev learns yoga from Karamveer. To propagate Yoga to masses they soon take over ownership from **Shankar Dev**, a patron of Kripalu Bagh Ashram at Haridwar. Shankar Dev wants and only trusts Karamveer. But since he is Arya Samaj member he is not just ready to take Sanyas. Sensing an opportunity, Ramdev steps in. Taking Sanyas means two things -  1) He can’t keep any formal relations with his family 2) He cannot maintain any material wealth. I am bringing this up of course because this is very important

* Balakrishna meanwhile sets up Divya Pharmacy using the license of a silent partner, Swami Yogananda. Balakrishna himself from **Nepal** has legal cases against him (still in courst) for forging his high school and other documents to attain a passport.

* In early 2000s, Aastha and Sanskar become household name. The TV guys select Ramdev over Karamveer because - saffron robes means authenticity. **An interesting story here is that after Aastha turned Ramdev down, our diligent Baba went to Sanskar paying Rs 1 Lakh for a twenty minute slot.** This is also where I learnt that channels like Sanskar and Aastha don’t earn from advertising but godmen paying them for TV slots to demonstrate their abilities

* We all now know the story. Ramdev becomes a household name, not only to nauli kriya or churning of the stomach but also his personality, self-depreciating humor and showmanship 

* Soon Ramdev has friends at high places. **Mulayam Singh, ND Tiwari from Congress, Sudarshan Agarwal – ex UP governor.** So when they are charged with Sales Tax fraud, Sudarshan Agarwal mounts immense pressure on Sales Tax Deputy Commissioner to drop the case and retire.

* Ramdev soon brings his extended family who takes over the business. His younger brother Ram Bharat is soon in charge of the finances. This causes rift between Karamveer and Ramdev. Afterall Ramdev shouldn’t have familial relations. So one day, Karamveer just walks out. 

* Swami Yogananda (whose license enabled the setting up of Divya Pharmacy) has a falling out with them. **Soon he is mysteriously knifed to death.** The neighbors are cagey and the case goes unsolved. 

* Enter Rajeev Dixit.  A swadeshi and founder of Azadi Bachao Andolan. Ramdev’s interest in entering politics leads to these two becoming incredibly close much to the discomfort of Balakrishna and Ram Bharat

* Meanwhile, his political favors with the Congress masters reap him reward as he wins contracts of Food Processing Plants. But soon, due to not paying workers at Divya Pharmacy minimum wage they draw the ire of CITU. Brinda Karat soon claims that the workers brought her ‘testicles of some sort of wildcat’. Apparently they told her deer horns and human skulls were crushed into the medicines. Though there is no proof to validate this, the samples tested by the Union Health Ministries’ Ayurvedic unit – AYUSH confirmed traces of human and animal DNA. Karat apparently met N.D Tiwari but according to her the minister didn’t budge to take any action

* Soon Ramdev starts to do roadshows across the country and abroad. Patanjali Ayurved Ltd is born over the controversial Divya Pharmacy. And here we see the next mystery. The disappearance of 77 year old TB infested Shankar Mahadev (Ramdev’s Guru). Mahadev was becoming quite vocal and anxious about the venture of Ramdev and his deputies. Police find nothing but a note in his room saying “I have taken some loan from you for this trust but I cannot pay it. Please forgive me. I am leaving”. Ramdev who was on a foreign trip didn’t cut it short as would have been expected. 

* Ramdev and Rajeev Dixit set up a new party – **Bharat Swabhiman Andolan.** 

* The Takeover of Aastha – When SEBI freezes 93% of Aastha’s owners share, sensing an opportunity Ramdev moves in and buys the remaining 7% for 10 crores in installment. The installments were never paid, but the ownership was transferred to Ramdev. Part of this was done in faith. Once the formalities are done, in a confrontational meeting, Ramdev bullies the owner and MD into resignation. Meanwhile, he asks another follower to buy Sanskar channel for him. Which that follower did.

* As mentioned earlier, keeping inline with Ramdev’s political ambitions, Rajeev Dixit and Ramdev became increasingly close much to dismay of Balakrishna and Ram Bharat. Soon, Rajeev Dixit was found dead in a locked bathroom. The hospital said it was cardiac arrest. Ramdev said on television that he had told Rajeev to take care of his health as he had diabetes, BP and heart disease. But Rajeev’s brother Pradeep says that he had no such health problems. Next, Ramdev convinces the family to conduct funeral in Haridwar as Dixit was son of the soil instead of his native Wardha. But as his body was laid for public demonstration, the Bharat Swabhiman Andolan workers were stunned. Dixit’s face was unrecognizable, strange purple and blue. His skin was peeling strangely. There was black, blue blood coming from his nose. Soon there was hue and cry. The Andolan workers wanted to conduct post mortem. Ramdev called a few of them for a personal meeting, confiscated their phones, checked their pens for cameras and told them that post mortem is against **Hindu Dharma.** When they refused to budge, Ramdev agreed but soon went back to the hall ahead of the workers and spoke on microphone ‘Some people have come from Mumbai. They want me to do a post mortem. Such cutting is against Hindu Dharma’. Soon Ramdev’s men got the body ready and set off to cremation ghats.

* Ramdev’s biggest fall came during his participation in the Anna movement. He wanted to use the movement for his political mileage. Hence while the original protesters were focused on a stronger Lokpal bill, Ramdev was more about bringing black money back. So he sat on a fast onto death protest. Meanwhile there was a backdoor meeting with senior Congress members (Pranab Mukerjee, P.K Bansal, Kapil Sibal and Subodh Kant Sahay). He then agreed to something and then went ahead and did the exact opposite. This ired the Congress as at midnight the cops swooped on the protestors with lathi charge. Ramdev of course famously tried to escape dressed in a **white salwar kameez**

* Part of the credit towards the success of Patanjali should go to their ex-CEO – **S.K Patra**. He helped them lay the foundations, setup best practices for what was a highly disoriented company with no ethics or standard operating procedures. Patra also used his connections to stabilize against the witch-hunting on Ramdev’s business enterprises by the Congress Govt. But soon Patra’s influence once again made Balakrishna and Ram Bharat uneasy. Patra was let off after some ugly confrontation with Baba. 

* Today Patanjali is the second largest FMCG company with revenue of **Rs 10561 crores**. Its best selling products are ghee – **Rs 1467 crore**, Dant Kanti toothpaste – Rs 940 crore. But Patanjali ghee isn’t normal ghee but actually white butter which is not really good for health. Caravan has published a transcript from the book on this section - [Link](http://www.caravanmagazine.in/vantage/patanjalis-desi-cow-ghee-even-cow-ghee)

* Part of the reason for Patanjali’s market share is its price. Its below market as Baba believes only in taking a marginal share. But this is also possible because working at Patanjali is considered as **seva** and asking for increments and privileges are frowned upon. Economic Times has published a transcript from the book on this section – [Link](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/fmcg/inside-patanjali-heres-what-life-is-like-in-baba-ramdevs-company/articleshow/59824892.cms) 

* There are a number of violations flagged by FSSAI (Food Safety and Standards Authority of India) including license number fraudulence on Patanjali noodles. A lot of third party agencies have written about the poor conditions and lack of hygiene in the production units.

Ramdev is a businessman, politician and godman rolled into one. He has no doubt helped popularize Yoga and Ayurveda in India. The people who speak to the author are no doubt captivated, influenced and no doubt bullied by him. His close association with BJP government today means none of the open cases would move anytime soon. His target is to get Patanjali to 20,000 crores by 2018-19. And under the environment of nationalistic and swadeshi assertions he very well might do it. 

Finally, I realise that the TL;DR post itself needs a TL;DR. But its quite hard summarizing a book without loosing on intricacies. Hence once again would recommend reading the book.

Edit 1: Formatting

Edit 2: Woah! Thanks for the Gold kind stranger. Though I would rather have people reading the book. While Indian non fiction writing and publishing are much to be desired, ventures like these must be encouraged. That will allow us to see similar good books that talk about interesting men, policies, events etc. "

Business/Finance,Long post - I hate high interest rates in India.,"Long time lurker. Thought I would share some of my rants about India here.
One of the problem with India is extremely high interest rates. When rates are this high (10% compared to 0-2% in many developed countries), cost of doing business is huge.


Consider the following scenarios

1) No one will invest in a business where the return is less than 10% per year. Otherwise, you will just park your money in a bank and earn interest on it. A lot of projects become unviable this way. Setting up big ticket infra projects, green field setups is virtually Impossible without government financial assistance, tax breaks.

2) Property bubble - A 20lakh loan financed at 10% rate for 20 years costs us nearly 50 lakhs including interest payments. So, even if your property prices increase by 150% in 20 years, a CAGR of 5%, you are losing money.

If you include your cost of money, You would have been better off investing those 50 lakhs in a recurring deposit instead of giving EMI. The RD will bring close to 70 lakhs. So a property price appreciation of (70-20/20) 250% or 6.8% CAGR is break even for your money. [I have oversimplified the calculation by not including rent saved, HRA etc]
Compare this to western countries, where property prices hardly rise by 0-2% y/y.

3) Polluting Truck menace - It is taking truck operators 10+ years to breakeven cost on a ageing financed truck. A truck operator will look for more than 10% annual return in order to make money on his investment. To save some more money, they cut corners and are also overloaded producing even more pollution. Read about recent NGT order banning 10+ yrs diesel vehicles.

4) Currency depreciation – Economics 101. A high interest rate depreciates your currency every year. Currency depreciation raises prices of fuels, coal, gas, important imports.

5) Trickle down effect – A lot of goods/ services which change many hands before reaching you becomes expensive, as every middle man would want to earn more than 10% on money invested. Think, cost of fruit/ vegetables you pay vs what a poor farmer receives. Think, petrol pump business, where a dealer has a commission of Rs 2+ for every litre of petrol sold.  

6) Trade deficit with China – Ever wondered why , it is so cheap to produce things in China. One of the reason is low cost of money there. We import every type of shit from China. Things we could have made right here in India.

7) Fiscal deficit from Gold – Stupid Indians keep buying gold thinking that the gold will appreciate like it did in the last  decade. We are the 2nd largest consumer of gold. In reality, the gold prices in $ are at a 5 yr low. But in India, prices have only risen. Do you know why? Hint – 40% currency depreciation..

If USD/INR was at 45 today, gold would only be worth 15k for 10gm.


I could go on and on but would now be interested in hearing your opinion.


Update1. Some of you have said that interest rates are right where they need to be. And that is 100% true. I should have been more clear while wording my rant.
It's just that - I hope for a India which has low interest rates. Obviously its not possible in near future

**The weekly fix**

The weekly fix will delve into the unforeseen depths of never-before heard scoop into the brazen world of Indian startups. Naww, I’m kidding. This’ll cover the announcements and news by the various startups, of the various startups and for the various startups.

Business/Finance,Broke up 30! What next???,"Hi Everyone,

I browse through reddit quite a bit and love the answers and support that comes especially under relationships/life.So here goes my story.

A little about myself. I'm 30 yr old Indian woman working in IT and earning well. I am the only kid and my mother raised me as a single parent after my dad left us.She has raised me to be independent and has given me freedom unlike other Indian families.

I had my share of relations when I was young and I was single for a considerable amount of time in mid 20's and I made good use of it. I started traveling and over years have come to love it. Travel opened doors for me in blogging and photography and my friends say I am decent at both. Being single also taught me value of friendships and I'm fortunate to have made some solid bonds over the years.

I met my bf (32 yrs) two years ago and with time we realized we do want to spend our lives together. As we started talking about future I realized that my bf is very keen to move to his hometown and take over his family business/ agriculture (he mentioned it casually once a yr ago. I had no idea he was serious about it).  I refused to agree for this as it is hard for me to relocate to a place which has zero opportunities for career. I hate the idea of staying at home or being dependent for finances. For the reasons above and also that I would be giving up all my friends,leaving my mom,work, travel everything for one person seemed like a bad deal.

We tried to come up with solutions but none of them made of us happy and hence agreed for mutual breakup. This breakup has left bitter feelings in me about everything. I want to stop feeling negative about my ex (somewhere I feel he could have stayed considering he has been staying in the city for 20+ yrs) and stop feeling sad for myself. I am scared that I might end up alone given the age taboo/caste etc in India and quite not sure how to deal with all the negativity in my head.Any suggestions are welcome!

Thanks,

Ablahnaari!

Business/Finance,Modi and Adani Relation | Lobbying and Crony Capitalism |,"**Modi-Adani Relation** 


When Adani’s son was married in Goa is 2013, guest list included the richest man in the country and many a chief executive and top banker and bureaucrat. Most, however, just stopped by the night before to bless the happy couple and skipped the actual wedding. But one prominent friend stayed through all the ceremonies over a couple of days, genial and relaxed like a favorite uncle. It was Narendra Modi, chief minister of Adani's home state of Gujarat. [Source-Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/meghabahree/2014/03/12/doing-big-business-in-modis-gujarat/#598fa3004df5)


When Modi’s keynote address at Wharton India Economic Forum was cancelled due to protest by the professors and students, the main sponsor, Gautam Adani also opted out of the event.

In 2003,  Modi, the chief minister of Gujarat, was taken to task by the Confederation of Indian Industry for the anti-Muslim riots in the state. Leading the charge were prominent industrialists like Rahul Bajaj and Jamshyd Godrej. The CII's attack on Modi provoked an angry reaction by a group of Gujarati industrialists, who organised themselves under the Resurgent Gujarat Group. Adani and Mehta were the leading lights of the RGG, which took on the CII on Modi's behalf. The CII was forced to apologise to the chief minister.

**Adani's Gains**

Adani, has travelled with Modi in the past year more than any other billionaire, helping him emerge as the most prominent face of India Inc. to the wider world. His wealth has more than quadrupled since Modi announced his candidacy in September 2013, the biggest gain among the country’s elite. He travelled with Modi to US, Australia, Bhutan, Brazil, Japan, France and China. After most of Modi’s foreign visits, Adani bagged business agreement from these countries.  [Source-Livemint](http://www.livemint.com/Companies/lf3WSzczbG4CLQtageeGbM/Meet-Gautam-Adani-the-billionaire-trotting-the-globe-with-N.html)



The rates at which the Adani Group bagged land from the Narendra Modi-led Gujarat government for its port and special economic zone (SEZ) project — between Re 1 and Rs 32 per square metre — were much lower than other companies that set up units in the state.  Tata Motors was given 1,110 acres for its Nano car plant in Sanand (near Ahmedabad) at Rs 900 per sq mt, Ford India paid at Rs 1,100 per sq mt for 460 acres close by, while India’s largest carmaker, Maruti Suzuki, bought about 700 acres in Hansalpur at Rs 670 per sq mt. Among other industrial groups, K Raheja Corp was sold land at Rs 470 per sq mt, while TCS had to pay at Rs 1,100 per sq mt and Torrent Power at Rs 6,000 per sq mt. (one acre equals 4,046.86 square metres). [Source-Business Standard](http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/adani-group-got-land-at-cheapest-rates-in-modi-s-gujarat-114042501228_1.html)

Special Economic Zones Rules, 2016, were amended by the department of commerce, to insert a provision on claims for refund under the Special Economic Zones Act, 2005. The SEZ Act under which the SEZ Rules are framed did not initially provide any provision for refunds of any kind before this amendment was introduced. The Adani Power Ltd. has claimed that it has paid customs duty on raw ¬materials and consumables – that is, coal imported for the generation of electricity. However, documents leaked to the EPW clearly indicate that the APL had not, in fact, paid the duty on raw materials and consumables amounting to approximately Rs 1,000 crore that had fallen due at the end of March 2015. It appears at face value that by amending the SEZ Rules to insert a provision for companies to claim refunds on customs duty, the department of commerce is ¬allowing the Adani Power Ltd. to claim refunds on the duty that has never been paid by it in the first place [Source-Wire.in](https://thewire.in/149156/modi-government-adani-group/)



Finance Ministry is not filing a review petition in the Supreme Court against Adani group for Tax Invasion of around 1000 Crore, Despite allegation by Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI), [Source-Wire.in](https://thewire.in/99801/adani-group-tax-evasion/)



Ironically, the biggest black money case that has come up before the SIT so far is that of the Adani group. The Adani group allegedly took out over Rs 5,000 crore to tax havens, using inflated bills for the import of power equipment from South Korea and China, the SIT on black money was told by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED). The Adani group vehemently denies any wrongdoing. Modi, after his rhetoric-filled ride to power, has been silent. Since Modi’s ascension to office, what has happened in the ED, which had registered a preliminary case against Adani in Ahmedabad and was handed details of DRI findings, is illustrative. The officer heading the Ahmedabad branch of the directorate was raided by the CBI, which accused him of possessing disproportionate assets. It failed to prove anything at all, despite months of investigation. The two senior-most officers in the Mumbai regional office, who oversaw the investigations in Ahmedabad, were forced out of the agency. The tenure of Rajan S. Katoch, who was heading the directorate when the case was opened, also ended abruptly. Apart from the Adani case, the Ahmedabad ED investigators were also pursuing some of the biggest money launderers of Gujarat.[Source-Wire.in](https://thewire.in/58640/black-money-investigation-a-feast-of-vultures/)"

Business/Finance,Scam ?,"Hi Redditors ;

Today i have got a ""fun"" experience.  [https://www.professionalscouts.com/](https://www.professionalscouts.com/)

Just registered in many websites to find a work... and then i got this phone call.

Scam or not, please give me your opinion. xD

&amp;#x200B;

First, a nice lady talking to me about super job opportunities.

Then i got to talk with a man, same super friendly, nice, perfect English... 

He is telling me he can arrange an interview for me with a package at 21.5lakhs a year.

Lets be honest, who proposes this kind of salary without even a meeting... nobody.

Obviously he is telling me that i will have a meeting soon to discuss it.

Again i got to talk to the first lady who just confirmed that the previous man was nice and then i got to talk to a third person.

&amp;#x200B;

At that point i am super doubtful : name dropping, big packages $$$, too friendly people, many interlocutors... 

Then come the funniest, someone is assisting me to read their websites and... finally it comes : 6000INR registration fee. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is it really common this kind of ""scam"" ?

I am not Indian and not much aware about this kind of stuff.... but it looks weird isn't it ?

&amp;#x200B;

For most of you it will be obvious its a scam, but it could help people more genuine ;-)"

Business/Finance,Indian banking system under attack!,"I have a strong reason to believe that Indian banking is under systematic attack. The shit hole goes very deep and the problem is compounded by the fact that the media ""tones"" down its coverage (obviously to avoid panic). There are malware attacks (on ICICI which is siphoning of email contacts and sending its account holders phishing emails), Advanced persistent threats on Axis Bank (they disclosed this to RBI), ATM frauds as in State Bank of India and multiple accounts of phishing attacks on individuals. Union Bank has also suffered cyber heist. 

A worrying trend is by use of SIM Swap. Fraudsters get your personal details (easily available through WhatsApp), your details through identity thefts and blocking your actual SIM's so that you cannot receive the SMS alerts. 

Two factor authentication is very basic (dependent on passwords alone) which again can be easily retrieved because most users re-use their passwords. 

Its getting scarier and worsened. 


A simple remedy as of now is to change PIN of your existing debit card and get ""CHIP and PIN"" card which secures transaction because they cannot be replicated easily. Of course, moving away from WhatsApp is a sensible decision (use BBM/ Threema) so that your identity details through phone numbers is not compromised. 

Edit 1: In response to ""proofs"" and so called ""click bait""; here are the links. Please connect the dots. 
Further, BBM and Threema allow you to be anonymous because outside the system, they can't do anything to your PINS. :-)

*“I am silent because there is conflict between my scholarly commitment to economics and my loyalty to the party's decided issues.”* - Subramanian Swamy, member of parliament [tweeting](http://www.thestatesman.com/news/india/subramanian-swamy-mum-on-gst-cites-party-loyalty/158145.html) about why he is silent on the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Bill that his political party supports so much. Just going to leave this here for you to draw your own conclusions.

**Going Gaga Over GST**

Last week, the Rajya Sabha [passed](http://indianexpress.com/article/business/business-others/gst-bill-pass-what-next-step-by-step-until-the-rollout-2952723/) the Goods and Services Tax (GST) - the tax reform that has been heralded as the most important piece of legislation in over a decade. While the common market of Europe is walking backwards due to Brexit, the common market within India is stepping ahead due to GST. The bill has been the subject of political bickering for a long time now. However, it was passed with 203 votes for and none against. With 0 votes against. They didn’t even blink twice, so you know there families weren’t being held hostage and all votes were entirely voluntary. But this has only been the tip of the iceberg. Even though both houses of the parliament have passed the bill, there is a laundry list of things that need to happen before we can all go home and forget about this whole GST business. The Lok Sabha needs to approve the bill once again. Then, a minimum of 15 state governments need to pass the bill. Then, the president needs to sign the bill. Then, a GST Council needs to be formed and the GST tax rate needs to be negotiated. Then, the central government needs to pass two supporting laws, and each state needs to pass a separate supporting law. And only then, we’ll be able to pocket all that cash from the GST-led economic growth that is being predicted. The deadline set for all of this is April 1st, 2017. Till then, government officials around the country are set to debate on extremely sensitive issues like whether cream biscuits should be taxed at the same rate as ordinary biscuits. #TeamBourbon.

**Uber-Didi**

Uber joined the long list of American MNCs that came to do business in China but inevitably fell on their faces. In a deal announced last week, the popular ride-hailing service will sell its China operations to rival Didi Chuxing in [exchange](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/02/business/dealbook/china-uber-didi-chuxing.html?_r=0) for a 20% stake in Didi, who will invest $1 billion in Uber. The two giants have been battling for the Chinese market for years and despite spending billions of dollars, no one has managed to turn a profit. In fact, Uber was facing a loss of $1 billion annually due to heavy competition in China. Once upon a time, Uber’s future in China seemed to hold promise. And now, the company is throwing in the towel. The company’s mistake? It tried to fight a land war in Asia. Although Didi was the bigger company in China in terms of market share, Uber did have its moments. Such as when a Chinese hip-hop artist posted a gangster rap song about how much he prefers Uber. Don’t Baidu it - China being China censored the whole thing just days later.

**Loans For *Pani Puri wala*s**

Banks use all sorts of fancy algorithms to determine if a borrower will repay a loan. Despite all of that, with the banking crisis, a huge amount of loans are at a risk of being Vijay Mallya-ed. So the fancy algorithms haven’t exactly worked out. Another one of those fancy things that banks use is a credit score. A good credit score will have banks lining outside your door shouting for your attention. A bad credit score will have you lining outside the door of the banks with a ton of paperwork. You need a good credit score to get loans. But to get a good credit score, you need to repay loans. So you see the chicken-and-egg problem here. This means a lot of people don’t even have credit scores. But those people still need loans. And banks won’t touch them with a ten-foot pole. Now, microfinance companies like Edelweiss, Bharat Financial, DHFL and many more are going places feared by the big boys of finance. A big push in the industry is to loan [money](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/saturated-cities-now-even-idli-vada-seller-can-get-loan/articleshow/53515598.cms) to pavement hawkers, scrap dealers and other self-employed individuals. For example - the makers of the extremely healthy chinese food at the hand-kart that parks near the local sewer every evening. Basically, giving loans to low-income borrowers without a credit score or any kind of formal financial history. If that sounds like a recipe for trouble, that’s because it is and we’ve already had that dish in the run-up of the financial crisis of 2008. And if history isn’t repeating itself here, it’s definitely rhyming.


**Too Many Branches Spoil The Bank**

The State Bank Of India has almost 17,000 branches which is very impressive. Especially since they get to brag about it in tables that rank banks by number of branches. But the bank isn’t doing itself any favours by putting 5 branches within a 1 km radius of each other, as is the case a lot of times with SBI. Because sometimes, it’s not the size that matters, it’s what you do with it that matters. And SBI is [considering](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/sbi-weighs-plan-to-shut-relocate-30-of-its-branches/articleshow/53494912.cms) a proposal to do away with such extra branches by consolidating them. It might make common sense to shut down branches when put like that, but then they won’t get to brag about how many branches they have. And investors love those kind of things. SBI is currently in the process of merging with its associate banks from Hyderabad, Mysore, Travancore and so on. It expects to have that completed by March 2017. At which point, that 17,000 number will balloon up to 24,000 branches, compounding that problem. A global consulting firm, McKinsey which was hired by SBI has recommended shutting down upto of 7,200 of those branches. Moreover, bank branches are so *2000s*. Online is where it’s at.

* India is a nation of chronic procrastinators. Just look at how much you procrastinate yourself, for example. For more proof, realize that half the people reading that last sentence just strongly agreed with it.

Moreover, who would want to stand in line to file tax returns when you can be a responsible and mature citizen of India while wearing your pajamas at the same time?

The CVC is hoping that the rankings will help focus anti-corruption resources to where they are needed the most. Meanwhile, Buzzfeed “writers” are already salivating at the thought of headlines like *Here are the top 10 most corrupt government offices. #6 will literally empty your wallet*.

The company’s business plan involves accepting sponsorships and carrying private payloads to the moon in order to make a profit. In future space missions, the company expects to make money by mining for natural resources on moon, specifically mining for Helium-3. This would’ve happened a lot sooner if only the moon had some oil. Helium-3 is all fine... But it’s no oil.

**Pandering To The Base**

Every politician does it. From the Donald in the US to Modi in India, it’s a political science lesson that crosses borders. As much as we parade the “developing-nation” tag around, India’s economy is still heavily dependant on agriculture as it employs almost two-thirds of the nation’s people. And these farmers also constitute Modi’s base and naturally, his government needs to pander to them before the forth-coming state elections. After a union budget that was largely seen as pro-farmer by earmarking almost $826 million (₹5,524 crore) for crop insurance plans, the government might play two more cards to appease the backbone of the economy. One, officials said last week that they are considering imposing a [penalty](http://www.reuters.com/article/india-crop-insurance-idUSL3N16U22P) on delaying of claim settlements for crop insurance. That’s when you buy insurance and if the rains don’t come in and your crops fail, you get paid a settlement. Two, the government is likely to extend the the current 25% wheat import tax which expires in March to continue [beyond](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-wheat-duty-idINKCN0WN1H7) March. The tax was imposed to shield domestic wheat farmers from cheap imports. Wasn’t exactly effective since wheat output in 2015 was down 10% from 2014, despite the tax.


**The Great Indian Addiction**

Indian people are addicted. It’s not a drug, gambling or internet addiction. It’s an addiction to gold. Gold imports make up a quarter of India’s trade deficit because we import almost 10 lakh kgs of gold annually. Billionaire Warren Buffett says about gold: “It doesn’t do anything but sit there and look at you.”  Clearly, Indian people think that Buffett uncle doesn’t know anything about gold. Rehabilitating the Indian people from this addiction can be hard but the government is trying. Recently, it introduced a 1% excise duty on imported gold jewellry. How did that go down? Jewellers went on an indefinite strike which was called off last week after [assurances](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-gold-strike-idINKCN0WM01T) that excise department officials won’t harass jewellers. The government also started a campaign to monetize the privately owned horde of Indian gold to cut down on imports. How has that worked out? The scheme only managed to attract 0.015% of the estimated horde of gold that is currently in family lockers and temple vaults. There was some golden news on that front last week as the iconic 200-year-old [Siddhivinayak](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-gold-siddhihvinayak-temple-idINKCN0WK1ZF) temple in Mumbai announced its participation in the scheme.

**Because Karma Is A Bitch**

Petty sabotage and backstabbing isn’t just limited to undercover spies and Indian politics anymore. The corporates are adopting these strategies as well. Last week, Uber filed a lawsuit at the Delhi High Court against its biggest Indian competitor, Ola. The lawsuit accuses Ola of creating 90,000 fake Uber accounts and using them to book over 400,000 rides, only to be cancelled at the last [moment](http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/23/11292310/uber-ola-lawsuit-india-fake-rides-lyft). Classic prank by Ola, right? Except Uber claims that Ola did this to disrupt its operations and frustrate its drivers. And Uber would know that because it has been accused of doing the exact same thing to its biggest US competitor, Lyft. Two years ago, Lyft accused Uber of booking and cancelling over 5,000 rides using fake accounts that were traced back to Uber employees. If true, Ola will only have taken a page from Uber’s own playbook. If you’re a betting person, be sure to put your money on Uber - that company’s got deep pockets and can drag this out as long as it takes. It recently declared $1 billion (₹6,688 crore) in annual profits from it’s [top 30](http://www.newsweek.com/uber-profits-elsewhere-support-sustainable-spending-china-ceo-440705) cities alone. To be fair, they also said they were sustaining huge losses in China where the company holds a 30% market share.

**Auto Engines Are The New Moon Landing**

69th Richest Indian on the famous Forbes Rich-list and the co-founder of Infosys, Nandan Nilekani is known for investing in startups that focus on big, transformative ideas. In his investment portfolio is Team Indus, a company that aims to land a rover on the moon and Systemantics, a company that focuses on robots. Last week, Nilekani made his [biggest](http://thetechportal.in/2016/03/24/sedemac-mechatronics-funding/) startup investment yet in a company called Sedemac Mechatronics. What’s bigger than futuristic robots and landing on the moon? Time travel, perhaps? No, apparently, it’s building small engines and powertrains for auto companies. Nilekani led the latest round of funding in Sedemac which summed up to a total of $7.5 million (₹50 crore). Sedemac counts the big boys of the auto industry like Tata Motors, Mahindra Group, Ashok Leyland as its clients and was started by an engineering professor at IIT-B with a couple of fellow IITians.

**The Chinese Dragon Wants In On India**

The “Big Three” of e-commerce in India - Flipkart, Snapdeal and Amazon - will soon become the “Big Four” with the entry of Alibaba, the chinese e-commerce giant in India. Officials from the company that is poised to [surpass](http://www.businessinsider.in/Alibaba-on-course-to-become-worlds-top-retailer/articleshow/51507633.cms) the world’s biggest retailer, Walmart and claim that tag for itself, said last week that Alibaba was looking to expand its presence in India. It is looking to directly enter the online retail segment later this year. Run by China’s richest person, Jack Ma, the company already owns 40% of Paytm and 4% of Snapdeal. Are Indian e-commerce companies coming together like brothers-in-arms to fight off competition from this foreign entity? Of course no. The Indians didn’t unite when the British literally invaded and aren’t going to do that now with the Chinese either. In fact, Flipkart co-founder Sachin Bansal and his Snapdeal counterpart Kunal Bahl already found themselves in a war of words on [Twitter](http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/flipkart-s-sachin-bansal-takes-jibe-at-alibaba-s-india-entry-116032600040_1.html) over Alibaba’s planned expansion in India. Alibaba, which still conjures images of forty thieves in one’s imagination, may tie up with the [Tatas](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2016-03-21/news/71705366_1_digital-india-alibaba-group-chairman-cyrus-mistry) to launch its online retail business as a joint-venture. This is because FDI regulations still don’t allow foreign companies to sell directly to Indian consumers, which is what Alibaba wants to do. Amazon, the US ambassador to the industry, merely connects buyers and sellers and doesn’t sell itself.

**Oli Gets Oil**

Nepal’s Prime Minister K. P. Sharma Oli recently took a trip up north to Beijing and stumbled his way into signing an agreement with China for the supply of petroleum products to [Nepal](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-nepal-idUSKCN0WP1WV). The country, which serves as a strategic buffer between India and China, adopted its first post-monarchy constitution last year. But protesters opposing the new constitution blocked trucks carrying fuel and essential goods coming from India. This five-month long “unofficial blockade” of Nepal had disastrous consequences for the Nepalese economy due to its overwhelming dependence on India. The distraught country says it now wants to import 33% of Nepal’s fuel from China in the future. Basically, after being deeply hurt by what the Indians did, Nepal is now looking for some quick rebound action from the Chinese. Indian officials, however, are far from alarmed that Nepal is trying to move away from the Indian sphere of influence. Why? Because there is this big huge chunk of rock called the Himalayas between Nepal and China.

Business/Finance,A reality check on tax rates,"So many people I know have a very poor understanding of marginal tax rates. They think that if you fall in the 20% bracket, ALL your income is taxed at 20%

Here is a reality check. In these calculations, I'm assuming that you have maximized 80c savings of 1.5L

If you make 12L/year, you would pay 1.32L as tax. Your effective tax rate is just ~11%

If you make 20L/year, you would pay 3.82L. Your effective tax rate is just 19.1%

If you make 40L/year, you would pay 10L. Your effective tax rate is just 25.1%

You would have to make 60L/year to get close to 30% tax rate

If you're making 60L per year, you're well off in most of the world (barring outliers like San Francisco) and fabulously well off in India. Does 30% tax rate really hurt you that much?

I'm personally within this tax range and I don't mind paying the money. It's a standard practice across the world for independent contractors like me to keep 30% of any money made aside for taxes.

Keep this in mind. The last majority of people would cap out under 20% tax rate"

Business/Finance,"Pakodanomics, Ola-Uber Theory, Box Office Theory","So when the most intellectual people of the country, honourable  Prime Minister, Finance Minister and IT Minister have made comments on the economy, I decided to go around and look in own way. 

***Note****: I am not an economist. I work in the IT sector and have been outside India from last two years.* 

Last week I visited Vijaywada, Andhra Pradesh almost after two years. All my relatives have settled there and once in a while, I make a visit there. To my surprise, I noticed a lot of changes in the way people spend money and businesses going there.

1. **Vastralatha** is a shopping complex in Vijayawada where a lot of wholesale shopping happens. Shop owners get the clothing raw materials (and clothes) from different locations and sell them there. It is almost the first stop for almost most of the clothes/clothing-material after manufacturing. On having a discussion with one the shopkeeper I came to know that his business gone down drastically. Despite Deepawali coming, there is no surge in sales. He says, ***""There is no cash in the market, how will people buy the goods"".*** Just to know more of him, I tried being naive and said that the government is promoting digital transactions and hence cash is less in the market, to which he replied showing a chart with many QR-codes printed on it, ***""I have PhonePe, Paytm, BHIM, Google-Pay as modes of payments still no increase in business after adopting them"".*** I said that maybe Amazon and Flipkart are consuming his business and he should try moving to online. ***""Nothing in online comes drops from air. They also must go from some outlet. I myself have proxies on Amazon and Flipkart""***
2. Vijayawada is almost like a business capital of Andhra Pradesh. A lot of people from neighbouring places come there to sell their products too. Hence a good number of 2-star and 3-star lodges are there in outskirts of Vijayawada. I then visited one such lodge, which is run by one of my friend's relative. I asked him about the hotel business the past few months to he replied, ***""Has dropped almost half in the last six months. Very few come now, and even those who come are unmarried couples.""***
3. The next day I visited a place called **Poranki**. It is outskirts of Vijayawada, almost a town. I like junk food around and generally eat at around 9:00 PM. The junk food stalls are open till 10:30 PM. I went out that day around 8:00 PM and to my surprise, I found almost all the shops closed. After wandering for 15 mins I found a shop where I ordered **Mirpakayi Bajji (***Mirchi Bhajji/ Big Chillies Fried***).** After having two of them I asked stallkeeper why have the shops closed so fast to which he replied, ***""Are you new to this place. It is happening almost from last one year. No one is having money. Those who have are also spending very cautiously. Due to the lack of customers, I am forced to close the shops early""***
4. The next day morning I visited my village from **Poranki**. *(I am sorry, I cannot tell you the village name for privacy reasons).* My grandma lives there. Besides her home, there are a lot of uneducated people who make materials like hand fans, mats, brooms, etc from coconut leaves and straw. They make them there and then go and sell locally or in other towns and cities. The place used to gleam with joy and noise when people used to sit together and stitch mats. All of that was absent. I asked our neighbour why. He replied, ***""There are more than 150 mats in stock not sold. What is the use of sitting and making more of them.""*** People make these products and travel via big share autos generally to towns. Autos are more frequent and easily available. The afternoon I went to our village bus stop, where autos also are parked nearby. I took a share auto and asked the driver about very fewer people at the bus stop. He said , ***""No one is going out of the village even to sell. Last week 3 autos drivers had sold their autos and moved into other businesses.""***

**My personal inference**: A lot bad is going. The news channels are not showing anything. The ones that do show about this, are yet very far away from the ground realities. I am just wondering about farm labours who have no source of income except daily wage. The news channels and people bragging about Hindi-Muslim debate are either paid or brainwashed. At the ground, there are many structural problems. Sadly many of them think it is their fate rather than the failure of governments."

Seeing the [growth trajectory of the confirmed cases country by country](https://i.imgur.com/noXGCYY.png), it can be seen that India is still on an upward trajectory AND has not yet reached the peak, one essential thing that shows the slowing down of infection in a country. With other countries, you can see they've started to curve in the graph. So the worst is still yet to come, and we won't know how much the rate of infection has been until testing capacity is increased multifold. The infection spread rate however have slowed because of the lockdown.

The country needs to be prepared with the worst that is yet to come, with PPE, Ventilators and all other necessary equipment.

Coronavirus,Is the most pathetic thing about Hindu-Nationalists their subservience to White-Supremacists?,"If you go onto right wing social media circles you find countless conspiracy theories that are pretty much copy/pasted from cesspools like Stormfront or /Pol/, many about how the “Soros” funded left wing media is unfairly critical of right-wing ideologies or how the mere existence “Radical Islamic terrorism” is justification enough to impose indiscriminate violence against Muslims. 

Under any one of Donald Trumps tweets you will find hoards of Indians venerating him and congratulating him for his policies against Muslims or celebrating his friendship with Modi. 

And the wave of anti-Chinese bigotry, perpetrated by racist whites in response to the coronavirus, has swept up India in such a frenzy that even Indian North-easterners are not safe from attacks and harassment due to having oriental features. 

There is such a innate desire for Hindu-nationalists to make sure that they are on the same side of every issue as white supremacists as both of them see their own community as being inherently better than the rest and therefore united in their contempt for the rest.

But the one key difference between the two groups is all of this ethno-nationalist bravado projected by the Indian government and its Hindu-nationalist supporters falls to the wayside when Donald Trump threatens retaliation against India for putting its own self interest before that of the white supremacists.

It’s almost as if they have accepted their status as being above the Chinese, the Muslims, etc but subconsciously they have accepted the rule of the white man over them. 

It’s not a surprise that over the course of his tenure, as India tries to contort and bend to appease him, Donald Trump treats India with almost a sense of restrained contempt. 

“For many years India has taken advantage of the US in terms of trade” - On trade

“If they were to disallow the drug from being exported to the US there maybe be retaliation, off course there would be retaliation” - On Hydrochloroquine

“And we're supposed to say, 'Oh, thank you for the library.' I don't know who's using it in Afghanistan” - On India’s role in Afghanistan

“ Our relationship with Pakistan is a very good one. Thanks to these efforts, we are beginning to see signs of big progress with Pakistan” - On Namaste Trump In Ahmedabad

“Tariff King"" - On India’s local industries 

While the barrage of pettiness and hate, that is reserved for countries like Bangladesh, Malaysia, Turkey and others in India’s more immediate neighborhood, is released the moment any of them dare to say something slightly critical of India, somehow this strong and aggressive Hindu-nationalist government almost always just cowers down to the US and complies accordingly to all their threats and requests. And it’s not as if they do it begrudgingly, their supporters continue to revere and look at the White House as a friend and well wisher."

Coronavirus,These Corona virus events are not the best way to judge Modi’s popularity. Hear me out.,"I have seen a lot of commentary online about how these taali banging and candlelight events show Modi’s unparalleled popularity and what it means for the future of our democracy. While it is true Modi is an extremely popular politician, I don’t think these events are the best way to measure it. Here is why:

* To begin with, most national leaders see a spike in their popularity when the country is facing a crisis. This is commonly known as [Rally 'round the flag effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rally_%27round_the_flag_effect). (For example, Trump, even after his colossal mismanagement in dealing with the Corona virus outbreak, has seen an increase in his approval ratings). Sadly, this makes the pandemic a good opportunity for populists and fascists to seize more power, and that should worry us. ([For Autocrats, and Others, Coronavirus Is a Chance to Grab Even More Power](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/30/world/europe/coronavirus-governments-power.html))

* Only a small percentage of people understand the semi-political nature of these events. For most people these were non-political events to fight Corona virus. Many people who might vote for other parties also took part in these events for a variety of reasons, including and not limited to love for the country (Rally 'round the flag effect), peer pressure, manufactured consent through media, boredom etc. 

* These events happened at a time when the entire country is under lockdown (something like this probably wouldn't be as successful as it was if there was no lockdown). People are locked in the house and glued to the TVs. Modi Govt used this situation to communicate and seek support for his events by non-stop media coverage. It didn’t matter which news channel you watched in the last few weeks, you couldn’t escape the marketing for these events. Dozens of popular film stars, sportspersons, religious leaders, etc were deployed to spread awareness and seek support for these “non-political” events. I doubt many of these celebrities will openly lend their support for Modi’s other openly political projects like CAA or NRC.

* Many news channels also portrayed the act of lighting the lamps as a prayer to the God to help fight the virus. Given how religious this country is and the situation we are in, the message was naturally persuasive for many people. **This is what really forced some in my family to light the lamps, not the message of solidarity or politics**. A few news outlets packaged yesterday’s event primarily as a prayer more than anything else and that worked.

* Opposition, whatever little is left, couldn’t openly oppose these events. The either unenthusiastically supported them or just kept quiet. That won’t necessarily be the case under normal circumstances.

* It is my assessment that the **devastating effects of the pandemic on the economy will have infinitely more impact on Modi's political future** then these marketing events. A lot of potential political damage to Modi on this would also depend on the performance of Congress as an opposition, and that’s a sign of worry given the state of the grand old party.

* Modi’s popularity is a by-product of a compromised media ecosystem. These PR stunts by Modi and the communalization of the outbreak proved that once again. So, in my view, **it’s the death of independent media that should worry us more than Modi’s popularity, as the latter stems from the former**. Sadly, I don’t see a solution for the media problem anytime soon. On the bright side, Modi’s popularity doesn’t automatically translate into victories in state elections for the party. We have seen that in the recent assembly elections where BJP lost despite major political events like the dilution of the Article 370 and the Ram Mandir verdict.

To conclude – No, 2024 Lok Sabha election results were not announced yesterday."

* According to the guidelines passed by govt. If someone was in contact with confirmed coronavirus patient and if he ask to doctor to test him for COVID-19 then the guidelines don't allow that test, since he was not a foreign travelers.

Not only that, their was more guidelines which contradicted the previous ones and according to these you simply cannot test a person for COVID-19 if he/she does not have foreign travel history. (these were only changed few days ago)

What's worse is the fact that a lot of people are openly spreading religious hate and trying to influence others regarding their beliefs. There are many right and left wingers who blame each other with childish comments.  Civil debates are non-existent and right-wing always finds a chance to blame non-Hindus and Liberals in almost every problem. 

My personal experience : 1) A guy literally wrote an answer saying Italians are victims of Coronavirus because they are liberals. A commentor on same answer even wrote that Italians deserve the suffering because ""they are leftists"". Both of them were Indians.

2) Many questions criticizing the government are quickly reported. Then those who don't agree with government's stance are put down as ""secular liberals"". 

3) One guy literally posted tweets from BJP Trolls in his answer and called them 'epic burn' and 'badass'. 

4)  Multiple answers ""completely"" blaming Muslims for Coronavirus ( Tablighi Jamaat should be blamed 100% but not the whole religion )

Since the story is in Hindi, here's a summary of the events as reported by Dainik Bhaskar

>गुजरात के मुख्यमंत्री के सचिव अश्वनी कुमार ने एक न्यूज एजेंसी को बताया- ‘गुजरात के अलग-अलग जिलों के करीब 1800 लोग हरिद्वार में फंसे हुए थे। केंद्रीय मंत्री मनसुखभाई मांडविया और मुख्यमंत्री विजय रूपाणी के विशेष प्रयासों से इन लोगों को वहां से निकालकर इनके घर पहुंचाने की व्यवस्था की गई।’ इसी व्यवस्था के चलते उत्तराखंड परिवहन की कई गाड़ियां हरिद्वार से अहमदाबाद पहुंची थी। दिलचस्प है कि ये काम इतनी गोपनीयता से किया गया कि उत्तराखंड के परिवहन मंत्री तक को ये खबर नहीं लगी कि उनके विभाग की कई गाड़ियां लॉकडाउन के दौरान कई राज्यों की सीमाओं को पार करते हुए 1200 किलोमीटर के सफर पर निकल चुकी हैं।

Ashwani Kumar, Secretary to the Chief Minister of Gujarat, told a news agency - ""Around 1800 people from different districts of Gujarat were stranded in Haridwar. With the special efforts of Union Minister Mansukhbhai Mandaviya and Chief Minister Vijay Rupani, arrangements were made to evacuate these people to their homes.” As a result of this arrangement, many vehicles of Uttarakhand Transport reached Ahmedabad from Haridwar. Interestingly, this work was done with such secrecy that even the transport minister of Uttarakhand did not get the news that many buses of his department had traversed distances of nearly 1200 km crossing the borders of many states during lockdown.

>27 मार्च को जारी एक आदेश से मालूम पड़ता है कि उत्तराखंड परिवहन की ये गाड़ियां सीधे प्रदेश के मुख्यमंत्री कार्यालय के निर्देशों के तहत गुजरात भेजी गई थीं। इनका उद्देश्य हरिद्वार में फंसे गुजरात के लोगों को उनके घर पहुंचाना था। वापस लौटते हुए यही गाड़ियां वहां फंसे उत्तराखंड के लोगों को लेकर आ सकती थी, लेकिन ऐसा कोई भी आदेश उत्तराखंड सरकार की ओर से जारी नहीं हुआ।

An order issued on March 27 shows that these vehicles of Uttarakhand Transport were sent directly to Gujarat *under the instructions of the Chief Minister's Office*. Their purpose was to bring the people of Gujarat trapped in Haridwar to their homes. **While returning, the same vehicles could have brought the people of Uttarakhand stranded there, but no such order was issued by the Uttarakhand government.**

Workers from Uttarakhand (working in Ahmedabad) who wished to return home during the lockdown came to know about these buses from their friends back home. 

>मुकेश कुमार बताते हैं- ‘अगली सुबह यानी 29 मार्च को करीब 10 बजे हम सब लोग इन बसों के पास पहुंच गए। हम 13 साथी एक बस थे। हमारी बस के ड्राइवर ने फिर हमसे कहा कि तुम्हें ऋषिकेश तक का कुल 18 हजार रुपए किराया चुकाना होगा। ये हमें अजीब तो लगा लेकिन हमारे पास कोई विकल्प भी नहीं था। मजबूरी थी इसलिए हम तैयार हो गए और हम 13 लोगों ने मिलकर तुरंत ही 18 हजार रुपए ड्राइवर को थमा दिए। हमें लगा था कि चलो इस मुश्किल वक्त में हम कम से कम किसी भी तरह अपने घर तो पहुंच जाएंगे। लेकिन वो भी नहीं हुआ।’

Mukesh Kumar says- ""The next morning, on March 29, around 10 o'clock we all reached near these buses. We were 13 companions a bus. **The driver of our bus again told us that you have to pay a total fare of 18 thousand rupees up to Rishikesh.** We found it strange but we had no choice. We were helpless, so we got ready and we immediately gave 18 thousand rupees to the driver. We thought that at least during this difficult time, we will somehow reach home. But that didn't happen either. '

>मुकेश और उनके साथियों को उत्तराखंड परिवहन की इन बसों ने अहमदाबाद से बैठा तो लिया लेकिन उत्तराखंड पहुंचने से पहले ही रात के अंधेरे में किसी को राजस्थान तो किसी को हरियाणा में ही उतार दिया। 

Instead of Uttarakhand, these buses dropped Mukesh and his companions midway. Some were dropped off in Harayana, and some in Rajasthan. 


> बताया जा रहा है कि गुजरात के ये तमाम लोग किसी धार्मिक अनुष्ठान में शामिल होने हरिद्वार पहुंचे थे। प्रधानमंत्री और गृह मंत्री के अपने प्रदेश से आए इन लोगों को उनका करीबी भी बताया जा रहा है। गुजरात के मुख्यमंत्री के सचिव अश्वनी कुमार के आधिकारिक बयान से भी इतना तो साफ होता ही है कि जहां देशभर में लाखों लोग यहां-वहां फंसे हुए हैं, वहीं हरिद्वार में फंसे इन लोगों को सीधा गृह मंत्री के निजी हस्तक्षेप के बाद विशेष व्यवस्था करके निकाला गया है।

It is being said that all these people from Gujarat had reached Haridwar to participate in some religious ritual. These people are supposedly close to the Prime Minister and the Home Minister. **It is also clear from the official statement of Ashwani Kumar, Secretary to the Chief Minister of Gujarat, that while millions of people are trapped here and there across the country, these people trapped in Haridwar were taken out after special intervention by the Home Minister directly.**

>दूसरी तरफ मुकेश कुमार जैसे लोग है, जिन्होंने अपने प्रदेश की गाड़ियों को आता देख अपने घर लौट पाने की उम्मीद पाली थी, लेकिन वो अब तक भी अधर में लटके हुए हैं।

On the other hand there are people like Mukesh Kumar, who had expected to be able to return to their homes after seeing the buses coming from their state, but they have been stranded.

Thanks to Modi ji I will now find out who are the intelligent people in my locality by looking at whether their lights are on.

For those who think this is a good move by Modi ji. All this is meant to do is distract people and create PR for Modi. I am sure it will have some positives, but  not by design.

Coronavirus,Get ready for a huge surge of Muslimophobia and Hindu nationalism after/during this lockdown,"I'll be straighforward: our country already has a lot of Muslimophobia (I am not gonna say Islamophobia because hating Islam as in ideology shouldn't be treated as a bad thing. Treating Muslims badly because you hate Islam, on the other hand, should be bad) and Hindu nationalism is evidently on the rise. Even though at first thought, it might seem that coronavirus may not affect the rate at which these two are growing, it is going to affect it in a huge way. 

The biggest blunder has to be the Tablighi Jamat. Out of 3000+ cases, 1000+ cases (more than 33% of the cases) has been linked to the Jamat. Among the rest, if you just see the initial list of dead people from corona, you will see a lot of them (if not most) had visited Saudi Arabia or other Muslim countries. As you might know, Muslims are already blamed for almost every historic and bad events. There is a huge chance that the entire coronavirus epidemic in India maybe said to be 'brought by Muslims to harm Hindus'. The number of fake news which tries to show that Muslims are deliberately trying to harm Hindus is already bad.

Unfortunately for Muslims, during this crisis when they were already being alienated by CAA-NRC, Jamat has been responsible for the steep rise in cases. Not that Hindus or other religions did not do something like that - Hindus got together in Vaishno Devi, they got together in many festivals, they got together during gaumutra party, they got together for 'thali bajaa'ing. But there has been no cases linked to any of those events. It might be that there are coronavirus carriers and cases among them, but since it isn't testable and observable, we cannot make any definite statement, it won't be scientific.

To make things worse, if we somehow get through this nightmarish pandemic, remember Modi will get all the credit. People will say that ""Modi handled the pandemic in India well"". This might even increase his approval rate among common people. Not to mention that if the apparent growth rate of cases in India remains slower than other countries, as it currently is, it might increase people's faith in the  superiority of India. People might say ""Look at those immoral westerners. They have been punished for their immoral lifestyle by karma. That is why India, such a holy land, hasn't been greatly affected by it apart from those Muslims and Chinese who brought that disease to India!"". This narrative might gain a lot of attention. Never underestimate the power of fake news, ethnonationalism, authoritarianism and racism."

Of course they haven’t even subscribed to any remotely sane news channel. I isolate myself in a small room at the back of the house to get away from it but the shrill voice of frothing at the mouth anchors permeates everything. 
What’s worse is that after being fed their daily dose of toxicity, family members discuss it all day with glee. They call up other distant relatives and say stuff like “TJ ke bare mein suna apne? Gaddar hain ye log. Modi ji ko inhe chodna nahi chahiye. Inka ek hi ilaaj hai. Line mein khada karke goli maaro sabko”

I’m desperate to get out of this house and get back to my own home (another city) but I cannot till lockdown is lifted. Now it seems that it may not happen on 14th as planned earlier. I’m feeling so trapped and it’s disturbing my mental peace. I don’t know how to deal with so much toxicity and hate everyday day after day. Any advice on how to stay sane will be helpful."

This divide will only further deepen if we allow the endless flow of misinformation and fake news through whatsapp and other social media sites.

With the coronavirus further slowing down an already relatively slow economy and increasing an already high unemployment rate, such misinformation will definitely cause more riots (or worse, a civil war).

The ones who will be affected the most by this are the poor. During the Delhi riots, most of the people who died and suffered were either poor or of the lower middle class and the ones who are suffering now due to the virus are also the poor. They will only further suffer if such misinformation that causes communal tensions are spread.

To the people who have read this post till now, if you see anybody in WhatsApp or any other social media site posting any misinformation or fake news, I implore you to call them out for spreading such misinformation and tell them that it is ILLEGAL AND PUNISHABLE if they further do so. Whether you are respectful to them or not is at your own discretion. If they still don't stop then report them to the concerned authority.

\#3: If the answer to #1 is ""B"", why we introduced lockdown so soon. I think it would have made more sense to introduce lockdown when there were at least 25K patients all over India. Now we have to wait for more time to reach the peak, which means more days of lockdown.

\#4: If the answer is not either ""A"" or ""B"",  then C) what is our current strategy? D) How it will end the Coronavirus? E) Does it require same level of lockdown throughout the country?

(Source: Google search for ""tablighi+jamaat+coronavirus"" for articles that appeared before March 13th [[link](https://www.google.com/search?q=coronavirus+tablighi+jamaat&tbs=cdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3A%2Ccd_max%3A3%2F16%2F2020)])

It was only by March 16th that information about the cases in Malaysia started pouring in and it was on March 16th that Delhi announced a ban on religious congregations. But by this time, these 3000 odd people had already been assembled in Delhi and come in contact with the international attendees, who presumably had brought the coronavirus. So, it was not criminal negligence or stupidity that made these people have this congregation but, simply, lack of information.

Which now brings me to the second point I want to make. After March 16th, the primary response of Indian state was to enforce the Delhi government's order by getting this congregation to dissipate, which given the information coming from Malaysia was absolutely the incorrect call. All of these people should have been tested for coronavirus and quarantined immediately. Instead, they were forced to return to wherever they came from and two weeks later we are spending our efforts tracing the tracks of all the people who had attended the congregation and all the tens of thousands of people they may have come in contact with during all this time after they left. The bureaucratic inertia of the Indian state took a relatively localized problem and made it much, much worse than it needed to be."

Coronavirus,RESTAURANT UPDATE-HOW TO SURVIVE & WIN AFTER LOCK-DOWN ENDS?," 

As per the article in [Businesstoday.in](https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/coronavirus-impact-50-restaurants-to-shutdown-if-lockdown-extends-till-may/story/399903.html) which is regarding the restaurant survival during the lock-down period in India it is said that:

**50% restaurants to shut if lockdown extends; Zomato, Swiggy business down 10% :** Only 5-6 restaurant chains have enough cash reserves to sustain more than a month, the sector will need government's help if there's no improvement after May.

Well, their is always a brighter side of the story! and this lockdown period can well utilized for all the research and development for the new market. Yes! you read it correct, it is going to be a fresh and new market, for you and your current restaurant too. So what does a new comer in the market does? What pre-launch preparation he does ? What he wants to boast about before and after the launch? 

Lemme tell you if you want to survive in this new market once this Covid-19 lockdown in India is over, you have to work upon one and only ONE thing and it is your RE-BRANDING & MARKETING! Yes, people must NOT forget your name from the market! and people must know what you are going to offer after the market is open. Obviously you are going to bank upon takeaway orders initially for few weeks or can be a month or two! Now when you know about this right now, then you can always cut short your staffing according to the needs of a take-away joint. Service guys can be asked to work on stipends for a month or can be motivated for the salary in coming month in part payments. Good ones will stay with you! Don't worry. 

DO NOT worry about staffing for next few months at-least, because their will be plenty of manpower available, filtered out from those restaurants who did not survived the impact. A great possibility of salary negotiation too. 

Work upon the ZERO waste menu. Do some research, ZERO waste menu is something where the only food waste is the stuff which once cannot digest or is toxic/not recommended to eat. For planned ZERO waste menu you may contact here and you might get some professional help if needed. 

Get a nice air purifier and alkaline water purifier if possible. Why? well apart from the health benefits, this thing is going to help you a lot in your re-launch event, how? We gonna talk in points mentioned below in a while. Their are hotel grades version for kitchen and guest area as cheap as 40k . 

Try to arrange your in-house delivery guy, so that you can save upon the commissions from Swiggy & Zomato, as their will be good number of delivery orders, saving upon the commission can save you your one month electricity bill for sure! Will tell you the ways to promote your own contact .

NOW: All is set you have done all of the above mentioned points, asked your landlord to waive off your rent and luckily he agreed! :) 

Its 10 days left now before lockdown gets over, what next? 

BOOST YOUR INTERNET / INSTAGRAM / YOUTUBE / FACEBOOK WITH ALL THE ENERGY YOU GOT! 

Now its time to hit hard with a well planned hospitality grade digital marketing campaign which is going to make your customers and as well as the potentially new customers about the things you have got for them once the market is open.

Its time to showcase your new ZERO waste menu with cool offers, you are going to shout about the healthy environment your outlet is going to offer to your staff as well as the people who walk in, you are going to boast about the alkaline way of cooking meals, you are going to boast about all the reasons you have for your existing customers as well as new customers to visit. 

A WELL PLANNED DIGITAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN TAILORED FOR HOTEL AND RESTAURANT NEEDS IS AN ONLY WAY WHICH CAN HELP YOU GET OUT OF THIS MESS AND HELP YOU SURVIVE THE CRASH.  

WHEN HIRING ANY DIGITAL MEDIA EXPERT, ASK THEM ABOUT THEIR KNOWLEDGE IN THE FIELD OF HOTEL/RESTAURANT OR F&B SECTOR. Why? Because if they know the 01s of F&B industry then they will be able to target your clients, menu promotions, promotions of your other food services easily. You just need to tell them WHAT YOU WANT. Rest you can leave all upon them, the deals, promo etc too, remember the points mentioned above, and don't worry! Situation is all fine, what is required ? a bit of creativity and vision.

Coronavirus,Risk of coronavirus from money.,"I heard from a neighbour that some suspicious person tried to enter their home today, on the pretext of some plumbing or electrical inspection or something like that. He wasn't allowed to enter and the door was shut on his face. Later when the neighbours opened the door, a Rs 500 note was kept outside. They are thinking that the person was a madman (like those Covid positive people who spit on others), and he may have spitted on the note.

Therefore, everyone should be careful when handling money, as someone may have intentionally or unintentionally spread the virus through that. I was quite shocked to hear of the above mentioned incident, especially if someone is resorting to such tricks for spreading the virus."

Coronavirus,Coronavirus lockdown: Tipplers in Kerala with withdrawal symptoms to get special passes to buy liquor,"Special passes will be issued for tipplers in Kerala to buy liquor but on doctor's prescription that they are showing withdrawal symptoms due to non-availability of alcohol in view of lockdown over novel coronavirus spread.

A decision allowing the purchase of liquor from the Excise department in a ""controlled manner"" was taken by the state government to ""resolve"" what it called many social issues including suicidal tendencies and frustration among people who consumed alcohol regularly.

However, the medical fraternity was up in arms on Tuesday against the government order.

The Kerala Government Medical Officer's Association (KGMOA) has decided to observe April 1 as 'black day' in protest against the order issued late on Monday night.

Dr Vijayakrishnan G S, General Secretary of the KGMOA, called the decision a medical blunder.

The Indian Medical Association(IMA) also flayed the Left government's plan to supply liquor to addicts based on prescription, saying it was not ""scientific"".

Three men in Kerala have committed suicide after allegedly showing alcohol withdrawal symptoms within days after liquor stores shut the doors following the 21-day national lockdown that came into force last Wednesday to try halt the spread of COVID-19. Similar incidents have been reported in other parts of the country including in neighbouring Telangana and Karnataka.

Kerala has the highest per capita consumption of alcohol in the country. The sale of liquor in the state has continued on an upward spiral despite the prohibitive tax on legal alcohol and the many dry days.

The state had a record Rs 14,508 crore liquor sales in 2018-19 sold through the Kerala State Beverages Corporation (Bevco), the state-owned liquor retail monopoly, compared to around Rs 11,000 crore in the previous year, according to official data.

Coronavirus,About the Tablighi Jamat situation,"I saw this hit piece on Aaj Tak, about how the Jamat members in Ghaziabad allegedly passed lewd remarks at female nurses, sang vulgar songs and dropped their pants, which is absolutely hilarious to me. Of course, you can't put anything past anyone these days, but I highly doubt that the people who spend most of their lives, away from civilization, locked in mosques around the world, praying, and talking about praying when they're not actually praying, would do anything like that. That is literally the mission of the Tablighi Jamat, they're basically Muslim sanyasis. Seriously, it's a matter of pride for them that they have nothing to do with the ""material world"", as they call it. They're literally oblivious, which exactly why they didn't pay heed to the coronavirus situation. Granted, that was extremely dangerous and wrong, but I still very much doubt that these people even know any vulgar songs, much less that they can muster the courage to sing any in unison to harass the nurses. 

Obviously, there is zero proof of any such occurrence. Aaj Tak basically hovered over a letter from the hospital staff for a few seconds, which said that these patients were being uncooperative with no mention of lewd behaviour, while yelling about ""jamatiyon ki kaali kartoot"". Sure, maybe they have been uncooperative because they're stubborn fools, but I doubt the other stuff about them dropping their pants is real lmfao. 

Of course, this is my opinion, based on my knowledge and experiences, and everyone is free to believe what they want, but I'd encourage you to exercise a healthy amount of skepticism while watching news these days. More so when you're sitting with your family, watching channels like Aaj Tak or Zee News (I know boomers love sensationalized news stories). Don't believe any of it until you see absolutely concrete proof. Most people here know this, but these channels are trying to push a narrative (with support from certain people), and they'll go to any lengths to do so. Facts and consequences don't matter to these people, as long as they get more viewers. It's a win-win for them, their overseers get to disseminate propaganda and stay happy with them, while they get TRP. Then they can say things like ""Aaj Tak ne sabko pacchada, no. 1 since the beginning of time"" and rub it in your faces."

Our Government is a master in distracting people from the tel question, is this the same. As I see people celebrating this moment and not asking about the real question here why are we doing this? I asked my family members and some friends they all said it’s a Mini Diwali. Today lord Ram killed the Meghanath so we all are celebrating. 

Well that’s funny isn’t it? In my personal opinion this moment is just used to distract people coz in recent 3 to 4 days the daily new COVOD19 cases are more than 500+. And reports are emerging from across the India that doctors don’t have enough PPE they are not being treated well by the officials and the people they are treating. Some media houses is saying that government is not providing reliable data on the no of cases and the measures taken by them to tackle Coronavirus. Also the reason behind the new fund PM Cares is also not clear as the PM relief fund already has more than 3,400+ Cr. Rupees. And how government is using the money from PM Cares. These are just small questions which we really do need to ask from the government and they don’t want to answer that. 

So,  we really need to ask is that is this was really necessary or it’s just a new propaganda by government to hide its tracks like previous many. 
I’m not saying this is bad or you shouldn’t do it I’m saying we really need to focus on the real problem which is coronavirus in this case. Celebrate and ask.

Regarding the Tableeghi jamaat incident in Delhi, few points

1. The gathering happened much before the lockdown was announced
2. Once the lockdown was announced the gathering wanted to disperse and asked the sdm for vehicle passes. The sdm did not respond.
3. Foreign visitors allowed into the gathering without proper checks. They were the source of infection.
4. Once infected people were found in the gathering why were they all not quarantined by the administration. Why were they allowed to return to their own places before 2 weeks?

After the above incident, the ruling politicians and there IT cell have worked very hard to create the narrative that Muslims are the reason for the spread of corona cases in India. The total lack of preparedness from the government is being glossed over.

Old and out-of-context videos are being shared to demonize the Muslim community. https://altnews.in is filled with so many examples where the facts have been unearthed behind fake videos on WhatsApp and Facebook.

The above was for context

I made a comment in my old friends WhatsApp group that with the April 5, 9 p.m. details a Jalao ""initiative"", corona would surely be gone. With sarcasm.

The response that I got had enough proof that my well educated friends had totally fallen for fake news and truly hated the Muslim community from their gut. A Muslim man licking fruits to spread corona. A Muslim man spitting on police. All of these have been debunked on detail on alt news. But the recipients of these fake videos totally believe them. For them opIndia, WhatsApp and Facebook are like the gospel.

The amount of poison they spewed was phenomenal. When I engaged with fact checks, the response that I got was

I'd rather worry about my future than think of fully utilising my data package for the day.

This was my experience with ""friends"" of twenty years.

How did we come to this?

A wise friend told me that if you want to remain friends on WhatsApp then better not to discuss religion and politics. Maybe he was right.

Maybe this fake news shitstorm has truly blinded well educated individuals, for whom bigotry has become second nature now.

Coronavirus,We need to extend support and solidarity to minorities and marginalized sections of society rather than vilify them if we want them to keep coming forward to report coronavirus symptoms,"We have all seen how Muslims are being vilified after [a Muslim congregation](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-52147260) sparked a new wave of COVID-19 cases. 
[List of names with addresses and mobile phone numbers](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/covid-19-activists-voice-privacy-concerns-over-leak-of-unverified-patients-list-on-social-media/article31236944.ece) of people who attended the Tablighi Jamaat event in Delhi are circulating on social media. Given the communal narrative being spread against them, this makes them extremely vulnerable to community backlash and hate crime.

A BJP Health Minister himself [revealed the names, age and locality of Nizamuddin returnees](https://swarajyamag.com/politics/this-is-why-the-names-of-the-nizamuddin-returnees-who-tested-covid-19-positive-in-assam-were-revealed) who tested positive in his state in an official press conference. He then asked the other Jamaat attendees to also come forward to face the same ""treatment"". Any guesses how many would willingly come forward now?

In most other parts of India, so far the administration [has made efforts](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/those-revealing-identity-of-covid-19-patients-to-face-action/articleshow/74590731.cms) to preserve patients anonymity, but I guess these rules can be bent if there are ""special circumstances"".

Yes, you could make an argument that other people need to know who they are so that they can stay away from them, but that can be easily achieved by using [hand stamps](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/03/privacy-fears-india-hand-stamps-suspected-coronavirus-cases-200320120033460.html) or [""Home Under Quarantine"" stickers](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/kerala-covid-19-stickers-being-stamped-on-houses-of-home-quarantined-families-1660543-2020-03-28), though IMO even these methods should be employed only on willful violators. But at least with these methods, only your immediate neighbors will know rather than the entire city/nation and any potential backlash will be minimized.

Charging people with the draconian National Security Act (which allows detention without charges or trial for up to a year) is also counterproductive, while that will definitely make violent people think twice before assaulting health workers, ordinary Muslims in UP, who are already deeply distrustful of the Yogi government, will now be even less forthcoming about their symptoms to health workers. 

Similarly, by now we have all heard of [how 5000 migrant workers were sprayed with bleach](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/30/india/india-migrant-workers-sprayed-intl/index.html) to ""disninfect"" them.

Coronavirus,"Delhi has not been given a single paisa from the ₹17,000 crore allocated to states. Here's why","Hi there!

As is being reported by the news, approximately ₹17,000 crore has been allocated by the Centre to the States. Here is a representative news report: [""Centre grants Rs 17,000cr to states to tackle coronavirus crisis"", Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/centre-grants-rs-17000cr-to-states-to-tackle-coronavirus-crisis/articleshow/74975956.cms)

Of this ₹17,000 crore, ₹11,092 crore is the Union's contribution to the ""State Disaster Response Mitigation Funds (SDRMFs)"" and the rest is as a ""Revenue Deficit Grant"".

**Tl;dr:** The short answer on why Delhi didn't see a single paisa of this money is because the Fifteenth Finance Commission (XV-FC) has not included Delhi in its recommendations. This is because Delhi is not a state. The Finance Commission, a constitutional body, deals with financial relations between the Union Government and State Governments.

**Deep Dive:**

The XV-FC recommended creation of a new “disaster mitigation and response fund” 💰 at Union (NDRMF) and State levels (SDRMFs).

These new funds are distinct from the O.G. 😎 'National Disaster Response Fund' (NDRF) and SDRFs under the Disaster Management Act, 2005. The NDRF and SRDFs are for ""*meeting expenses for emergency response, relief, and rehabilitation due to any threatening disaster situation or disaster.*”

The NDRMF and SDRMF are for *""local level and community-based interventions which reduce risks and promote environmentally-friendly settlements and livelihood practices.*"" Large scale mitigation will continue to be addressed by broad developmental programs and policies of the Union and State Governments.

*Note 1*: The difference here lies in the words **response** (NDRF/SDRF) and **mitigation** (NDRMF/SDRMF). Mitigation is pre-disaster. Mitigation actions reduce or eliminate the loss of life and property by lessening the impact of disasters.

*Note 2*: The NDRMF/SDRMF are statutory (legal) funds under the Disaster Management act, 2005 📝. Just like the NDRF and SDRFs.

*Note 3*: the Supreme Court 👨‍⚖ , in 2016, in an act of judicial activism (🙄) directed the creation of a National Disaster Mitigation Fund (NDMF) and state SDMFs. This was criticized a lot cause the court’s got no business in the executive 💼 working. This direction was not followed by most governments in India, and has remained a non-starter 🚫

Similarly, the approximately ₹6000 crore of Revenue-Deficit Grants are only for state governments.

**Edit and Update:** It seems that an inherent fact is being overlooked by people in the comments. The Union’s devolution under the XV-FC’s recommendations is a *constitutional obligation* and was meant to happen regardless of the Coronavirus epidemic. It also seems that people are (rightly so) peeved at red-tape because effectively the Government of Delhi does not get funds to combat this crisis. Some possible financing mechanisms that I’ve elaborated in the comments section are:

* Further Union contributions to Delhi’s SDRF (most effective)
* Making funds available from the Union Home Affairs Ministry (improbable given constrained budgets)
* Ways and Means Advances from RBI (30 day credit limit)
* Union spending through New Delhi Municipal Corporation (limited geographical spread)
* Municipal Bonds (underdeveloped and tight credit)
* Allocations from PMNRF and PM-CARES
* Donation drives from citizens and civil society"

CAA-NRC-NPR,"In an effort to replicate a #ShaheenBagh-like demonstration in #Bengaluru, a group of over 300 women began a 24-hour protest in Frazer Town Thursday to express dissent over #CAA_NRC_NPR, reports @ralpharakal | @IndianExpress Read:",
CAA-NRC-NPR,Kerala Chief Minister duty-bound to approach me: Governor Arif M. Khan,"New Delhi: Kerala Governor Arif Mohammad Khan has said that the Constitution gives him many options and he will take a decision at an appropriate time on Kerala’s Pinarayi Vijayan-led Left Democratic Front government moving the Supreme Court against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

“As far as I am concerned, the rules of duties are clear. It is already established how the Chief Minister is supposed to approach me. The Chief Minister is duty-bound to approach me before he passes any such order. My role is to see that the state works according to the rules. I am not claiming supremacy,” he told The Sunday Guardian.

Khan said it was his duty to ensure that the rule, law and Constitution were followed in letter and spirit in the state. “Also, it is my responsibility to ensure that the Constitutional machinery does not collapse,” he said.

“Be you ever so high, the law is above you. You have to respect the law. Once the President has given assent to a law, as Governor, I have the right to protect it. I am moving in a Constitutional way. I am not a rubber stamp,” said the Kerala Governor.

The plea filed by the Kerala government under Article 131 of the Constitution on disputes between Centre and states, stated that the CAA violates the right to equality under Article 14 of the Constitution of India, right to life under Article 21 and freedom to practice religion under Article 25. The Kerala Assembly also passed a resolution earlier demanding scrapping of the CAA, claiming that the Act, which was passed after following due process by Parliament, was unconstitutional.

Saying that “dissent is the essence of democracy”, Khan cited the Constitution to accuse the Pinarayi Vijayan government of violating the law on key issues like passing a resolution or challenging the CAA in the Supreme Court, without keeping him in the loop.

“I have no problem with the government, Opposition, or anybody holding a different view on CAA, NRC (National Register of Citizens) or NPR (National Population Register). Everyone is free. But my only point is the rules should be followed as stipulated by the Constitution,” he said."
CAA-NRC-NPR,"Telangana assembly latest state to oppose CAA, NPR, NRC",
CAA-NRC-NPR,Why the root of Delhi's Hindu-Muslim riots is a malevolent creeper planted by Supreme Court,
CAA-NRC-NPR,I rant.,"This is just an expression of my personal opinions; if you disagree, I would like to listen to your opinion as well.

Firstly, I wish everyone good health and safety during this pandemic. Now that the entire country is virtually locked down, protests have stopped, and now is the time for introspection.

* I have a feeling that the protests are aiming at the wrong thing. Yes, the CAA-NPR-NRC is extremely diabolical and dictator-like; yes, it is going to choke an already suffocating Indian economy. But, there is something that the BJP-RSS have successfully diverted attention from. It is extremely unpleasant that this is not receiving the required attention.
* On February 14, 2019, a JeM terrorist rammed an explosive laden truck into a group of CRPF jawans, killing 40 of our dear soldiers. On 26 February, the Indian Government ordered an airstrike on Pakistan, an unprecedented move, in retaliation. The next day, the newspapers reported the Government's claims: the airstrikes purportedly killed 300 terrorists in a ""high-tech and luxurious"" camp, with swimming pools, etc.
* A Reuters report suggested that the airstrikes did nothing; the high-tech camp turned out to be a run down madrasa, the bombings barely damaged the madrasa, and there certainly weren't any ""300"" terrorists. BJP rode to power exploiting an anti-Pakistan emotion and romanticising the Indian Military, something that the Opposition could not oppose the BJP on, considering the election time and the sensitivity.
* Around two months ago, Dy.SP Davinder Singh was caught with terrorists. You just need to search his name up on Google to find out everything. When he was posted in Shopian in 2017, a terrorist attack took place. Worse, he was posted at *Pulwama* when the 14 February attack took place. The manner in which the NIA, headed by Y.C. Modi (who gave a clean chit to the cunt Modi for the 2002 riots), snatched the case from the J&K Police is extremely unsettling, as the J&K Police are capable of taking up such a case, considering the security status of J&K. Furthermore, even on the godi media channels, this issue was toned down heavily, signifying one thing - *the BJP-RSS combine knew about this and worse, they could have planned it.*
* They certainly planned it. They either let the Pulwama attack take place or planned it themselves. The fact that they used the Balakot strikes as an election strategy proves that they didn't chance upon the opportunity - it was months in the making. This is extremely dangerous, because we have two obese cunts with every desire to stay in power - even if it means treason or death. We also know that all the planning is done at Nagpur (RSS HQ) meaning there definitely was RSS's hand in it as well.
* We need to step up our vigil and bring this issue to light. Why haven't we heard an udpate since then? Why is it that even after a year, the govt. is unable to apprehend the Pulwama suspects?Now that our only means is social media, we **must** step up our pressure on the Government. A few ways to do that are: do no argue with RSS trolls on social media, flood the feed with questions, reports, anything you find. Do not waste time or energy retweeting or giving unnecessary attention to bigoted statements of attention-seeking whores.
* Secondly, Shaheen Bagh has to disperse. They cannot stay there, especially during a pandemic. It's a risk to their health and gives an opportunity to stoke hatred for them again. We must appeal to them to disperse; it will be in the interest of the true spirit of the country.
* Thirdly, it is 100% true that the only party that has the capability to oppose the BJP is the Congress. But not with fucking Rahul Gandhi. Let him get another time to prove his shot, not now. Scindia's defection should be an eye-opener. We *have* to pressurise the Congress to purge itself of the Family Power, and even all the politicians who stay only for power. Keep only those who are loyal and ideologically committed. Listen to Tharoor, hold elections for the President. It will take time to reorganise Congress, but there still are 4 years until the next elections.
* This rant is long and tedious to read, but I urge you to pay heed to my two cents. We must remember that we are fighting an ideological enemy, years in the making, disciplined, trained and dreaming for this very moment for years. Protests are good, but we fail to understand one thing: even our protests lack a bit in secularity. True secularism comes from celebrating diversity, not repressing it under the guise of equality and irreligious temper. Through our protests, we must spread literacy, education, upliftment of the Depressed and Marginalised. We need to hit BJP below the belt: its Hindutva agenda that is blatantly upper-caste arrogant and bigoted.

TL:DR - Make Sachin Pilot the head of Congress and Shashi Tharoor in South India. We cannot fight unconstitutionalism with the same breed."

>  
>And  for that, the purpose of CAA came into existence to protect these  minorities from the religious persecution in the hands of majority of  these three countries while giving them Indian citizenship but it  doesn't mean that it bar the entry of any muslim from other countries of  the world, they can seek Indian citizenship under the Citizenship Act  of 1955 and it is wrongly stupid argument that it will stripping the  citizenship of Indian Muslims. It also doesn't mean that it would give  citizenship of India to these persecuted minorities very smoothly, No  never they can attain Indian citizenship only on the basis of the proper  process of naturalisation, if they will failed in this process then  they can't attain the Indian citizenship.  
>  
>Don't interpreted the CAA with **NRC**  because the CAA has nothing to do with NRC, the legal provisions of the  NRC have been part of the Citizenship Act, 1955 since December 2004.  Also there are specific statutory rules of 2003 to operationalise these  legal provisions. They govern the process of registration of Indian  citizens and issuance of national identity cards to them. These legal  provisions have been on the statute book since last 15–16 years. The CAA  has not altered them in any way whatsoever. Don't interpreted it like  that illegal Hindus outside and inside India will be protected via the  CAA and muslims will be discriminated, no not at all, both illegal  Hindus and Muslims claim for Indian citizenship equally via the process  of naturalisation, where CAA will not given blanket protect to Hindus.  
>  
>Don't  interpreted the CAA in the context of Ahmadiyas in Pakistan, hazaras in  Afghanistan and illegal rohingyas in India because Ahmadiyas in  Pakistan are in majority and they believe in the Pakistani version of  Islam and not maintain the level of minority same as hazaras in  Afghanistan stand in the internal context of their governance and  rohingyas are hostile community at international level and they are the  native of the neighbouring countries and they are illegally stable in  India without the citizenship of India and they will be identified under  the NRC for the purpose of deporting at their place.

&#x200B;

The  pretext of your answer assumes that since the countries mentioned in  the CAA (Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh) have failed to protect  their minorities, and henceforth, failed to keep-up with the  Nehru-Liaquat pact, and since these people might share ancestry  with/were born in pre-1947 India, it’s the responsibility of the Indian  State to protect them.

However, Afghanistan wasn’t a part of the partition, and nor of the Nehru-Liaquat Pact. Why have them under the same belt then?

In  that case, if we’re opening our doors to religiously-persecuted  minorities from other countries (which is a good thing), why not include  Muslims and other non-Hindu minorities from Nepal (which was a Hindu  Rashtra until as late as 2008), and non-Sinhalese people from Sri Lanka?

You  also seem to contradict your statement when it comes to Rohingyas (who  according to Amnesty International, are the most persecuted minority in  the World), Hazaras or Ahmadiya Muslims (you exclude Ugyur Muslims too)  citing that they are Muslims (and thus, constitute majority in their  respective country). Please note that Ahmadiyas aren’t even considered  Muslims in Pakistan, and CAA can, very flexibly, be extended to support them.

Why is it a factor for us that they belong to the majority?

Let me tell you - because, as of current version of CAA, it does NOT mention *“religious persecution”*  at all. It just says that if you belong to <INSERT ALLOWED  RELIGIONS>, and were in India in b/w <INSERT DATES>, you shall  be offered Indian citizenship.

Now, if they’d include Muslims too, entire citizenry of Pakistan would have a free pass to Indian citizenship.

I’m  all in for greater humanitarian interests of supporting refugees, but  all of this evidence points out that this step from government is a  petty tactic for winning the Bengal elections (by the support from  Bangladeshi Hindus and other immigrants).

&#x200B;

>**Irrelevant Argument related with the Violation of the Articles of the Constitution of India——**  
>  
>There  is argument of the constitutional obligation on CAA then understand it  broadly, there is no any provision of CAA has been violated any articles  of the Constitution of India include Article 14 as well. Understand  it---  
>  
>**Article 14** (**Come** **under** **Part-3** **of** **the** **Indian** **Constitution**) doesn't  deal with the part of citizenship that obliging towards the status of  citizenship, the purpose of Article 14 check implied where equals are  treated differently without any reasonable basis. But where equals and  unequal are treated differently, the Article 14 does not mean that all  laws must be general in character. It does not mean that the same laws  should **apply**  to all persons. It does not mean that every law must have universal  application for, all person are not, by nature, attainment or  circumstances in the same position.  
>  
>**Article** **5 to 11** **(under** **PART-2)**  are the only articles of the Constitution of India that deal with the  context of Citizenship, where Article 11 state that it grant of  citizenship shall be subject to any further law that the parliament may  passed in this particular regards, its the only union parliament which  have the power in this particular issue, it is not within the domain of  states. In the context of Citizenship Article 5 to 11 of the  Constitution of India shall read along with the Citizenship Act of 1955  coupled with the foreigners Act of 1946 that deal with the who is the  foreigner of as far as India's concern.

It’s not that this bill is ‘*literally*’  targeting the constitution of India, but it’s hurting it’s principles  of equality in the sense that the Indian Government is judging people  (and I quote you) by *“level of minority”*,  and that too, falsely. Religious discrimination faced against the Tamil  people in Sri Lanka, or the pain of Ugyurs in China is no-less than the  plight of Hindu people in Pakistan.

Also,  you comment that we shouldn’t tie up CAA with NRC. However, there are  two main reasons that I can cite in favor of studying CAA in light of  NRC:

* Firstly, the Home Minister, at least in 7 of his recent speeches, has always spoken of them together.
* Secondly,  and more importantly, because, assuming the NRC pan India will be  similar to assam, it will give extreme discretionary powers to local  authorities, who have the power to claim ANYONE (not Muslims, not  Hindus, not Christians, yes anyone) as ""doubtful citizens"". The basis of  such a conclusion is vague, and hence extremely exploitative. It’s like  giving them \[the Registrar\] a free pass to exploit the poor, or  anyone/any community they hold grudges against. Don’t we already have  enough of it?  
Not to forget, it can be used as a tool to suppress  dissent - If you dare say anything against the government, they’d have  the authority to strip you off of your citizenship. This pain might be  less for non-Muslims because if they are rich, they can hope to claim  citizenship under the CAA (*cough* bribe *cough*).

The  sea of reasons mentioned here are enough for people to oppose a bill.  The NRC is tangential to this discussion, but forms a very important  base of the ongoing protests.

Also,  these protests aren’t just against CAA, or the NRC, or NPR for that  matter. It’s also against the brutality with which the police took  action against the protestors. Among all other things, it is also to  assert our right to dissent, and to assert the fact that people’s  opinion has a rightful place in a democracy, which given the current  government’s stance, they are crumbling. (Just today \[Jan. 3. '20\], Home  Minister said that they wouldn’t move an inch backwards on CAA.)

Enhance your  knowledge and maintain the status of democracy of this nation.  
   
>  
>“CAA is not in the context of stripping the Citizenship of any Indian Citizen and their fundamental rights”  
 

You also wrongly quote the Arabic Kalma - *“La Ilaha Illallah”* sprayed on the wall in Jamia. It literally means *“Ekam brahmasmi, dutiya nasti”*,  which if you’d be Hindu enough to read Brahma Sutra you’d know means,  “There’s just one God. None other.” People might call it 'Brahma',  'Ishwara', 'Bhagwan', 'Allah', 'God', a tree, or whatever - but it’s ultimately one (An idea which is  popular even in a religion such as Hinduism which is known for it’s many  gods – Many Hindu school of thoughts subscribe to worshiping idols, but  the belief across Sanatana Dharma (even in the Nastika philosophy) is  to believe in the absolute - *'Brahmand'*).

Also,  you talk about violence in the protests. I cannot speak for everywhere,  but from the news reports, it seems that most (and the largest)  gatherings against CAA-NRC-NPR are peaceful. Even if there was violence,  the brutality with which the police is reacting doesn’t justify any of  it. (Raping minors, killing people!!).

There  have been reports of how people have been planted in the mob to  instigate violence - you know who this would benefit - definitely, not  the protestors.

In the end, I’d like to quote you:

>Enhance your knowledge and maintain the status of democracy of this nation.

It’s  the malicious intent of votes for which the current government is doing  all of this. It’s not the humanitarian grounds on which it is trying to  attract/steal/plead support for it."
CAA-NRC-NPR,Have a few questions regarding CAA," 1. What is the total number of immigrants/refugees that will come under the purview of CAA? The only information I could dig up was the comment by Union Minister G Kishan Reddy who said the exact data for determining the number of eligible refugees for citizenship under the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) was yet to be prepared. CAA protestors and supporters seem to have very different numbers for this.  
2. Given that the cutoff date for CAA is 31.12.2014 - what kind of proof a persecuted person is expected to provide for proving his entry into India before said date? Also, what are provisions for refugees belonging to mentioned religions in CAA but entering India after the cut-off date?  
3. CAA is said to cover only persecution on basis of religion and not persecution on grounds of race, gender, membership of a political or social group, language, ethnicity, etc. But what is the yardstick for classifying or ascertaining this?  
4. NRIC and CAA are two sides of the same coin and as such cannot be viewed separately. Who is a 'doubtful citizen' under Sub-rule (4) of Rule 4 of the 2003 Rules, which says that ""during the verification process of the Population Register (or NPR), a step before the NRIC is prepared, an individual or a family would be marked as ""doubtful"" citizen or have ""doubtful citizenship"". It is neither defined in the 2003 Rules nor in the Citizenship Act of 1955. There is no clarity as to how local authorities will identify and decide on who is a doubtful citizen.  
5. Given that the NRC exclusion rate in Assam was approximately 6%, are we looking at exclusion of at least 7.86 crores of people? Will CAA act as a safety net for said people who belong to Hindu, Sikh, Jain, Buddhist, Christian & Parsi communities?- a narrative that is being focussed by CAA protesters. What happens to people from communities (Muslims & others) who are excluded from NRIC and do not fall under CAA - Do they end up going before Foreigners Tribunals as in the case of NRC exclusion in Assam?  
6. What is the total number of illegal Bangladeshi immigrants in Assam and what percentage of those will be eligible under CAA? The only info I got is Sriprakash Jaiswal, Union Minister of State for Home Affairs, made a statement in Parliament on 14 July 2004 put the total number of illegal Bangladeshi immigrants in India at 20 million with the Majority being in West Bengal & Assam."
CAA-NRC-NPR,Karnataka Lawyers/Judges protest against CAA/NRC/NPR in Bengaluru front of Vidhana Soudha. Video,
CAA-NRC-NPR,The state if suppression and labeling those in dissent as anti-national,"

India above everything is a democracy. But the ruling government has turned it into a revenge saga where every voice against it is seditioned.  

Any reason that goes in favour of government is strictly supporting suppression. 

A law is a law. Let CAA be implemented. Let NPR  be implemented but snatching a citizens right to protest, labelling them against the interest of nation, how can that be justified? 

The governments outreach program is aimed to gain support of like minded people and not pacify the dissenting citizens. 

There’s a reason Hon’ble is prefixed against union ministers and they are just ganging up now?
As if the GOVERNMENT will reward them for hate speech. The more the better, is that how those union minister works now? 

I am not here to change someones POV, I’m simply anguished that the democratically elect government is acting like the communist china in many aspects now. 

Also the Rise of BJP has shown me how weak and stupid most of the opposition parties are.

CAA-NRC-NPR,"Ten Big Lies on CAA, NRC & NPR Exposed",
CAA-NRC-NPR,Chronology of Exclusion - CAA NPR NRC,
CAA-NRC-NPR,Join the Protests before its too Late #SamvidhanZindabad,"For all the fence-sitters who are doubtful if they should come to protests, keep in mind that these students are not just fighting for their future, but for your future as well. Fight against CAA+NRC+NPR before its too late.

How does it feel like watching someone getting amputated, blinded, beaten by lathis and Tear-gassed while fighting for your Rights?

\-1) \[Coz fuck you Natural Numbers\] Govt is trying to give these protests a communal angle. DONT fall for their trap. Many international news have also claimed this being anti-muslim, try to clear things as much as possible. Assam wants every illegal migrant out, be it Muslim, Hindu or Sikh. And I support that. But everyone should be given fair trial and Govt should give those legal citizens of India which are not in NRC full support to procure documents of proof. 

CAA+NRC+NPR are not Anti-Muslim, they are Anti-India and Anti-Constitution. **Our founding fathers i.e. Mahatma Gandhi, Patel, Nehru, Bhagat Singh, Maulana Azad, Sukhdev, Chandra Shekhar Azad, Bhimrao Ambedkar, Neta Ji and many many more, all wanted a Secular India and they formulated this Constitution (and Article 14 in that) and set the guideline for the future course of our nation. We owe our Freedom to them and we should respect their Principles**. By going against the spirit of our Constitution we are disrespecting them. If we start questioning their decisions, then we have gone too astray and are not worth being called an Indian.

0) How to protest while Section 144 is implemented - [https://mobile.twitter.com/akshaytarfe/status/1207504829343383552](https://mobile.twitter.com/akshaytarfe/status/1207504829343383552)

[https://mobile.twitter.com/TheSphinxSpeaks/status/1207434348502212608](https://mobile.twitter.com/TheSphinxSpeaks/status/1207434348502212608)

1) Go through this article to understand what is going on **behind the scenes at BJP HQ**. How they are planning to communalize the country.

[https://thewire.in/media/cab-bjp-whatsapp-groups-muslims](https://thewire.in/media/cab-bjp-whatsapp-groups-muslims)

2) Also, keep in mind that the new evil is NPR, a rebranded NRC exercise. They have added 2 new questions to the census-based on Nationality of Parents and details of Passport

3) Data Protection Bill has already been introduced in Lok Sabha. Go through it. Summary at  [https://www.businesstoday.in/current/policy/personal-data-protection-bill-2019-central-government-power-may-undermine-privacy-of-citizens-people/story/392186.html](https://www.businesstoday.in/current/policy/personal-data-protection-bill-2019-central-government-power-may-undermine-privacy-of-citizens-people/story/392186.html)  I think after we get success on CAA we should continue the momentum and protest on other issues as well.

4) I don't have any personal experience of getting beaten by Lathis, though I have participated in protests earlier in my life. I would suggest the protestors to wear at least 4-5 layers of thick clothing so as to minimize the effect of Lathis. Heck, we are a nation of Cricket fanatics.. why don't we wear Helmets and Cricket Pads underclothes and protest? 

5) For past few days, while having a discussion with fairly educated people, I saw some of the biases in these people eg. Muslims are bad people (*Eureka!*), Muslims have beard (*WTF? Sikhs have too, so you'll go behind them next?*), Muslims are extremists, America also censors them (*US censors a lot of other people too for eg your Kaka*),  [Hindus went from 23% to 7% in Pak, which is false](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/pakistan-bangladesh-non-muslim-population-citizenship-amendment-bill-bjp-1627678-2019-12-12)  ( [Another report, choose which one you want to believe](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-50720273) ) . It's pretty normal to have bias and I don't blame these people as I too had these bias at some point of time but then sense prevailed. Any community of people looks at another community with suspicion, and when most of the Political and Film fraternity has been painting you with a single colour, it is bound to happen. 

Don't let this narrative get to you. **Bad people are there in every religion**, be it Christians, Hindus, Muslims or Sikh or even Buddhists. There are Christian terrorists, sikh terrorists, hindu terrorists, buddhist terrorists and muslim terrorists. Just because there are terrorists in some religion doesn't mean all the followers of that religion are evil or terrorists. 

6) This whole fucking exercise is actually bad for Non-muslims. **Rs. 1900 crore has already been spent by State for Assam NRC**. Govt has cut Rs. 3000 crore from Education budget. What do you estimate it will cost to do the same NRC exercise nationwide. Any guesses? Hint: There are 28 States in India. 

Growth is already low, Inflation is increasing, All sectors are down. It doesn't take a genius to know, such divisions and instigation on communal lines will only lead to communal riots which will affect many innocent Non-muslim and Muslim families country-wide and Govt will not come to their help. 

PS. I am not from Delhi but I am planning to shift to Delhi in January to dedicate myself to active protest and continue the momentum further. Meanwhile, I am trying to help my brothers and sisters on ground by spreading awareness through social media.

CAA-NRC-NPR,"Join us for the Mahila Ekta Yatra on February 14, 15 & 16 to protest sites across Delhi to express solidarity with thousands of women sitting 24*7 to oppose the discriminatory & draconian CAA, NRC & NPR. Let us reaffirm our commitment to a secular and inclusive India.",
CAA-NRC-NPR,Complex threads linking Farooq Abdullah's release (kashmir) and Amit shah's repositioning on CAA/NPR/NRC - cut the clutter,
CAA-NRC-NPR,"It is the Left that is leading the Anti-CAA Movement, while the Liberals are trying to seize it.","It is the Left that is leading the movement against CAA. From Jadavpur University to JNU, from Bengal to Kerela, it is the left that is on the streets. Kerela, as you know, was the first state to refuse implementation of the bill. They are now also the first state to go to Supreme Court against any Central govt law, for the first time in history.

In Bengal too, the Left Front parties were the first who started to protest against CAA (started since October 2019 against NRC). They were the first to protest against NPR and threatened to destroy detention centres if they are built forcibly. The bourgeois media (imcliding the likes of NDTV) focuses on TMC whose leaders have no problem meeting with the PM and continue the work of NPR, despite protests. They refuse to create a national front against CAA.

Left Front parties was the first alliance which sent letters to all the CMs requesting to not implement the CAA.  Despite potential risks of their only govt (Kerela) to be banished.

The Congress is uninterested in leading any serious movement against CAA. All they do is call some half-hearted meetings that no one attends. The states with Congress govt do not play a frontal role to lead the protests in their states.

The Right understands this well. You don't see Liberal organisations being attacked. It is the Left orgainsations and unions that are being attacked by the Right.

Still, the Liberal organisations are acting as if they are the one doing all work. Liberalism is the political wing of capitalism. It inherently leans rightward (since going left is opposing capitalism). Their enlightened centrist attitude (""both sides are wrong dude"") will never be able to remove the breeding grounds of fascism (which is capitalism). If we let Liberals act as if they are the saviours of India, fascism may eventually fall due to powerful protests, but its origin factors will never reduce. Neoliberalism will continue and eventually give rise to Fascism once more."

This is unofficial as it is an opinion of the students of Jadavpur University, here's how it goes  
To,  
*The Hon'ble Ex-Chancellor, Jadavpur University.*   
SUBJECT: **Letter of Rustication to Kindly Terminate your Hon'ble Services Effective Immediately.**   
Sir,  
It has come to the attention of the general students of Jadavpur University that you were present on the premises of Jadavpur University in the evening of 19.9.2019, along with miscreants who hurled bombs, sexually assaulted women and vandalized sections of the university. Furthermore, you arrived uninvited to Jadavpur University on 22.12.2019. We have investigated your behavior and motives and come to the conclusion that they are shameless attempts to seek attention from students, thereby wasting our valuable time.   
Furthermore, on 23.12.2019, as part of the ongoing evaluation of university officials by students, you were asked a number of questions about the NRC, NPR, CAA; the SC/ ST Commission, violence unleashed on Muslim and other students and so on. We have found your responses to these questions unsatisfactory. They were as innocent of knowledge about BJP led police brutality on Muslim and other students as you are innocent of integrity. Academically speaking, your thesis holds no water and your defense is weak. Moreover, the students are convinced that your decision to stir up violence against students at Jadavpur University follows the party line of the Bharatiya Janata Party. We regret to inform you that we cannot attest to an unblemished record in your character certificate either.   
Keeping the above in mind, you are being informed of your rustication from the position of Chancellor of Jadavpur University. The students' body of Jadavpur University has also decided to disown you from the position of the Hon'ble Governor of West Bengal.   
**Your report card has been attached for your benefit.**   
**General Knowledge**: Less than satisfactory   
**Argumentative capability**: Poor   
**Sense of history**: Nil   
**Strengths**: Unwavering dedication to ignoring violence against students, activists and Muslims.   
**Overall character**: Spineless

CAA-NRC-NPR,69 reasons why I protest against Modi / BJP,"Here, I have compiled a list of points that came to my mind against Modi / BJP. This list can be improved, by expanding each point a little, by adding links, by adding new points and by grouping some of the points together or listing them in order of chronology. On each of the following points we can make memes/detailed explanations and distribute on social media.

1. 2002 Riots complicity. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkIJXTdxg60](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkIJXTdxg60)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0z114wnwXtQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0z114wnwXtQ) [https://caravanmagazine.in/reportage/emperor-uncrowned-narendra-modi-profile](https://caravanmagazine.in/reportage/emperor-uncrowned-narendra-modi-profile) [https://caravanmagazine.in/vantage/zakia-jafri-gulburg-society-massacre-modi-2002](https://caravanmagazine.in/vantage/zakia-jafri-gulburg-society-massacre-modi-2002)
2. [Haren Pandya murder](https://caravanmagazine.in/politics/haren-pandya-narendra-modi-murder-case-supreme-court) Haren Pandya was a popular leader of BJP in Gujarat and a potential rival of Modi. He was assassinated while he was on a morning walk. His security was mysteriously withdrawn by the Gujarat government headed by Modi just days before his murder.

4. Sanjiv Bhatt is in jail. If an IAS officer is in jail in India, most likely he would be very honest. [https://www.firstpost.com/india/ips-officer-sanjiv-bhatt-sacked-shame-then-frame-trend-part-of-vendetta-politics-of-gujarat-2400796.html](https://www.firstpost.com/india/ips-officer-sanjiv-bhatt-sacked-shame-then-frame-trend-part-of-vendetta-politics-of-gujarat-2400796.html) The case of Sanjiv Bhatt is a prime example of the vindictive politics of Modi. Sanjiv Bhatt may or may not be innocent, but it is clear that  Modi can stoop to any level to ruthlessly destroy his opponents. Sanjiv Bhatt was sentenced for life in a 30 years old case.  To put this in perspective 180 custodial deaths happened in Gujarat in 16 years, not  a single cop was punished Read more at: [https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/180-custodial-deaths-in-gujarat-in-16-years-no-cop-punished/articleshow/69881991.cms](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/180-custodial-deaths-in-gujarat-in-16-years-no-cop-punished/articleshow/69881991.cms)
5. In 2005, Sanjay Joshi, Sangh's blue-eyed boy and Modi's rival, figured in a controversial CD. He was immediately removed from all posts in the BJP. The video was later revealed to be doctored; a police officer later testified that the CD was given to him by controversial police officer DG Vanzhara. But, by then, Joshi had fallen from his perch.

CAA-NRC-NPR,What Is The CAA-NPR-NRC Link?[Explainer],
CAA-NRC-NPR,19 Questions on NRC-CAA-NPR to ask BJP Workers,
CAA-NRC-NPR,To all Christians in Kolkata; Today at 3.30pm there is a peaceful procession to protest against CAA NRC NPR. Meeting point is main gate of St Paul’s Cathedral. People of all faith are welcome.,

CAA-NRC-NPR,Fresh Anti-CAA protests staged in #Chennai. Former IAS officer #KannanGopinathan (@naukarshah) joins the protest @madhavpramod1 with the latest #CAA_NRC_NPR #CAA #CitizenshipAmendmentAct,
CAA-NRC-NPR,"For those who still insist that CAA, NPR have no effect on Indians & those who are here legally","So the premise that the CAA, NRC and such ways to profile the population of the country (under the pretext of checking illegal immigration) is fundamentally flawed. 

It is just a ruse. Slowly and gradually - the segregation , the discrimination will spread. Till it becomes all consuming 

A few days ago, this happened:

https://www.news18.com/news/india/hundreds-of-huts-of-illegal-bangladeshi-immigrants-razed-in-bengaluru-turns-out-all-are-indians-2465113.html

Based on a vague complaint by an MLA. But an action which resulted in the actual demolition of housing (admittedly, slums - but housing nevertheless)

So the problem wasn't slums (which would've been a noble cause) - but slums occupied by perceived ""foreigners"" 

As of today, another politician has raised suspicion that a bunch of construction workers were foreigners - because he saw them eating ""poha"":

https://www.news18.com/news/buzz/bjp-leader-who-thinks-eating-poha-makes-one-bangladeshi-has-united-all-foodies-against-him-2471355.html

Poha. Please understand.... ""P.O.H.A"".....

So - clearly - there is no actual basis for these actions & statements. But houses *have been* damaged and lives have been disrupted.

Now - a lot of the affected folks *did* have proof in the form of Aadhar cards, PAN Cards. 

So imagine the state of the folks - who don't have the (right\any at all) paperwork. Those folks shall be thrown into detention centres:

https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/assam-detention-centre-inside-indias-1st-detention-centre-for-illegal-immigrants-after-nrc-school-ho-2099626

But in a turn of events that not many are surprised by - the PM is straight up denying the very existence of such a detention centre:

https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/pm-modi-on-citizens-list-nrc-rumor-of-detention-center-raised-by-congress-and-urban-naxals-is-a-lie-2152700

The idea is - if such blatant lies & borderline fascism isn't stopped right away - it will keep growing and expanding and directly affecting more and more sections of the population.

One religious minority today, another tomorrow, backwards castes and tribes, sexual minorities and more.

Mind you - the ruling party threatened an entire state with blocked ration concessions - because Kerala objected to the implementation of NPR.

https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/bjp-leader-claims-kerala-won-t-get-ration-after-stopping-npr-yechury-says-we-ll-see-114872


For all the love & online appreciation we shower on those who have served in our armed forces, the same isn't extended to them in real life. Here is the case one such decorated Army veteran:

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-48523963

In what is quite possibly ***one of the highest profile situations*** to have arisen out of this entire fiasco, relatives of our former President have been excluded from the list of ""citizens"" in Assam - where the NRC was first implemented to near disastrous results:

https://www.news18.com/news/india/nrc-list-2019-former-president-fakhruddin-ali-ahmeds-family-among-2-million-in-assam-staring-at-uncertain-future-2291967.html


Now - either you are somehow still completely unaware of such events - or know about it but choose to turn a blind eye, willingly.

If it's the former - i hope my response ( and proof) makes you realize the events & brutalities that exist outside our admittedly privileged lives.

If it's the latter - well, i can't do much.

Edit: Thank you for gilding me, kind stranger.

I would like for all to bring up the cost of implementing NRC across the country - when discussing the same with folks who insist that the exercise has no religious or communal angle - and strictly a logistical viewpoint:

https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/nrcs-cost-benefit-analysis-caa-protests-6197030/"

CAA-NRC-NPR,Thousands converge at Chennai’s Wallajah Road to protest CAA-NRC-NPR,
CAA-NRC-NPR,What is NPR? How does it affect you?,"NPR is first step of the National Register of Indian Citizens, which is the other name of nation-wide NRC. NPR is a collation of all ‘usual residents’ living in India. Under the Citizenship Rules, 2003, a National Register of Indian Citizens is to be produced after filtering citizens from non-citizens. 

How is this filtering done?

First a local officer “verifies” the list & issues notice to “doubtful citizens” from list of local residents. These “doubtfuls” must now prove their citizenship. Following this, a draft list is published.
If you think your inclusion in the draft list is enough, it’s not, because the rules permit objections to the inclusion of any name on the list. Presumably, anyone can file an objection. The decision of your Indianness is made by an officer.

NPR also collects sensitive personal information of every Indian, including passport details (~5.5% of Indians have passports).

Back-end for NRC already seems to be ready, see the login page, here http://lsi.gov.in/srs/nric/loginnric.aspx ([source](https://twitter.com/DilliDurAst/status/1209385926251540480))

Also, All-India NRC and CAA are both part of the same law, the Citizenship Act, added by Vajpayee-Advani in 2003 and Modi-Shah in 2019, respectively. [Vajpayee-Advani imagined an all-India NRC and Modi-Shah added a Muslim filter](https://theprint.in/opinion/vajpayee-advani-imagined-an-all-india-nrc-and-modi-shah-added-a-muslim-filter/339366/)

> As per the 2003 amendment, the Indian government shall count all its citizens and create a National Population Register or NPR. The government will then verify the citizenship of the people counted. Once it does, the verified citizens will become part of another document, the “National Register of Indian Citizens”.

[Union cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, approves over Rs 8500 crore for updating National Population Register](https://twitter.com/PTI_News/status/1209401270605209600)

Note that the NPR will be carried out alongside the Census -- so most people will be confused, thinking it is the census rather than first step of the NRC.

To know how it came into being, read the following thread by Srinivas Kodali, https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1209029898695659521.html"

CAA-NRC-NPR,My experience at Anti CAA-NRC protest in San Francisco outside Indian consulate,"<throwaway account>    


So a protest was organized in San Francisco outside the Indian Consulate on 26th January against CAA,NRC and NPR. More than 400 people showed up but to our surprise the consulate was ready for protestors. They had made a small area with barricades around their building and hosted 25-30 people with pro-CAA placards. The people who were called by the consulate were highly abusive and provocative. The placards they were holding had words like ch\*\*tiya, pigs, calling us terrorists etc. They were also given a sound system to undermine our voices. It just broke my heart to see that these consulate people stooped to such low level.

These people would occasionally come out and enter anti CAA protestors and shouted Jai Shree Ram and hurled slurs at muslim people, called everyone Pakistani and went back to consulate premises.

Here's the link to some of the pictures.

As you can see (especially in the last picture) the well built premises inside the consulate hosting abusive people.

This has been repeated by Amit Shah, Narendra Modi and extensively on social media by IT cell. They even released a [video from 2003 of Dr. Manmohan Singh](https://twitter.com/BJP4India/status/1207542398282162177/video/1) and have invoked [everyone from Mahatma Gandhi to Jawahar Lal Nehru to Rajiv Gandhi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Vu4-foePyc) for justifying the existence of  CAB and then CAA.


As is with all things BJP this cannot be further from the truth, even without considering the upcoming NRC and NPR, CAA is a pure BJP propaganda at its best. Except for Assam maybe who are against all refugees majority of India is protesting for very different reasons.

This bill now a law should be opposed by every Indian because it is establishes religion as a basis of citizenship and excluding one particular religion from it. By doing that it destroys the very thing that makes us different and frankly much better than countries like Pakistan, Saudi or any other country which give preferential treatment to one religion over another. The very thing strictly prohibited by [Article 14 of our constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_14_of_the_Constitution_of_India). It goes directly against it.

It is also worth mentioning that wording of the clauses in the bill as explained in the RS and LS is completely different from the bill which was actually passed. In all it's six clauses it makes no mention of 'prosecuted minority' or religion but simply refers to them as community. Henceforth excluding all but one community which seems to be the goal all along.

And lastly if government is so sure of their effort being noble and genuine why are they clamping down on every effort to protest it. If you're just and right let the public debate and truth will come out. As the official motto of our nation says सत्यमेव जयते|

This is all without adding it with NRC, once the act is coupled together it becomes clear what the real intention of this government has been all along. To demonize, de-franchise an entire community which has been prolific part of this land since the independence.

This is why each and everyone of us should fight against this fascist law which reeks of Nazi Germany and if you're one those who are happy that Muslims are being ""shown their place"" then don't forget Jews weren't the only one who suffered under Hitler. He took entire Germany with him effects of which can still be seen even 70 years later."
CAA-NRC-NPR,Expansion of Nationwide Protests + Ban EVM,"EVM is a computer - hence it is hackable.

Counter Argument - But BJP lost in Jharkhand!

Opposing View - BJP would have lost by an even bigger margin in Jharkhand had paper ballots been used.

&#x200B;

I think the CAA, NRC, NPR protest is at a stage now that it can be used to rope in related issues and expand the reach of protests to meet demands which should have been granted to us long ago.

The Expanded Five point demand by protesters should be :-

1. Roll back CAA. Population census is fine (under Census Act 1948), it does not come under the ambit of Citizenship Act of 1955. However, NPR and NRIC do come under the ambit of Citizenship Act - the government should say that they do not intend to go through with the exercise of NPR and NRIC in their current term - until 2024.
2. Jobs, water and affordable food - where are ""achche din""? This was all promised by the government.
3. Ban EVM from all forms of elections in India - only paper ballots.
4. Police involved in manhandling of CAA protesters and breaking protester's property should be indicted in fast trial courts.
5. State government should compensate families of victims abused by the police.

&#x200B;

The protesters should not stop protesting unless all these demands are met summarily - we need to tell the government this time  who really holds the power. 

&#x200B;

If we do not demand justice, we will never receive it - current India is by no means a ""Ram Rajya""!"
CAA-NRC-NPR,Watched 'Kaala' (2018) starring Rajnikanth and I think it is one of the most revolutionary movies from Indian cinema.,"Just watched yesterday after recommendation from a friend and got blown by the hidden symbolism and references which pans all issues and the roots behind  which our country is facing .
It is one of the few movies where you need to watch it frame by frame to understand the metaphor which the director wants to convey albeit in a mass movie style.


Rajinikanth and his aura might be at the centre, but the focus is Ranjith’s ideology that operates in the nooks and corners of the screen where our eyes might not usually wander

The film opens to crowded bylanes of Dharavi, with a voiceover detailing the struggles of its inhabitants, the “urban poor”, who were jotted on the margins of the success story of Mumbai and just like that, with the flip of a page, forgotten. Numerous buildings will come up in Dharavi, its denizens are told, bringing modernity and prosperity to their lives. But its people don’t want a 225-square foot cell masquerading as advancement; they want their own freedoms.


It is an anti caste and Ambedkarite movie but unlike other movies  the protagonist kaala here is a fighter who wears all black which he calls the colour of struggle,of hard work. 

The antagonist Hari Dev (Nana patekar )is a Modi like figure who consider himself as the saviour Rama ,dresses all white  and  fantasize  a clean,digital  and pure India at the expense of decimating the lower class. 

Kaala represents the dark, poor precarious world whereas Hari Dada’s neat, clean, white milieu is used as a mask to hide his malicious criminal psyche.

Kaala delves into lives and cultures, and shows us that contrary to the perception of ‘unclean’ – if at all there is anything ‘clean’ about the Indian city, it is thanks to them. The film, in the spirit of Baldwin, repeats that the way people treat you is testament to their own fear and inhumanity, and not your own inferiority.

The colour of black ( Periyar) ,Blue ( Ambedkar) ,Red( Karl marx) is beautifully portrayed in the climax .

Kaala is not only a display of alternative social symbols but it also builds a radical political alternative against the bourgeois rightwing politics of the current times. It showcases the growing democratic consciousness of the Lower Castes, religious minorities, women and other working class people in the depraved land of Dharavi. The films at its core represent the idea of democratic socialism. It retold the epical battle between the haves and have not’s in an actual sociological space"

CAA-NRC-NPR,Something to reflect on during ongoing protests.,"With the ongoing protests over the CAA and the NRC/NPR going on across the country which has united and electrified the country there will be outsiders as well Indians within the country that would be wondering why there hasn't been a similar level of outrage about the massive amount of child deaths or the deaths of innocent labourers in factory fires or the continuing spate of rapes in the country. The very thought of child dying in the hospital should spark a strong reaction from us but there has not been the kind of outrage that this issue deserves.

This is something  that needs to be reflected on. Recently Hasan Minhaj called this compassion fatigue, ( Caring about every issue all the time). There are way too many issues in the country that need to need a voice and need to be fought and changed.But it's difficult to protest about everything all the time. This populist sentiment is reflected in the print and visual media as well, the news of the children dying should be blockbuster front page news but it has only got a small snippet on the major newspapers and the CAA Protests have taken precedence. 

The shelf life of the issues have a short life in the media and a short attention span among the people. I’m trying to say that we should strike a balance, at all the CAA Protests the people should say that they want a better nation with better hospitals, better working conditions , basic safety and security for women and they will keep protesting until they get it. By doing this we can ensure that these issues are still voiced and are in the public and media eye."

* The police will thereafter arrest all suspected rapists and due process will be followed in the court of law. It is upto the rapist to prove otherwise.

* The Government understands that women may have problems due to them being victims of rapes more often. Hence special fast track courts would be set up to provide them justice. Here we will assume their innocence unless proven otherwise.

* Some anti-women groups would call the above as specifically calling all men rapists. It is not. It is just providing quick access to justice to women.

* No non rapist would be affected by the process."

	1.	Are NRC and CAA separate?

Yes. 

NRC is not a law, It is a process mandated by  the Indian Citizenship ( Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Cards) Rules 2003.
Source

But are they connected? 

YES.

Since any rules issued from time to time by the government are taken into consideration while interpreting any law. In fact there is a clause in every Act specifying the same, in our case, Section 18 of the Indian Citizenship Act 1955.

Source

	2.	What is the CAA, how can it be misused?

(a) CAA and why it’s unconstitutional

The core idea is to make it easier for  undocumented immigrants from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan to get Indian citizenship. The catch is that these immigrants can’t be Muslims.

Are there really ‘persecuted minorities’ that would benefit from this legislation?

Yes, 31,313 individuals to be precise.
This was revealed by the government itself during a hearing by a parliamentary committee on the 2016 version of the Bill. The committee had asked how many people would benefit from the legislation. The Intelligence Bureau replied:


But by specifically excluding Muslims (and Jews), the Bill has raised justified concerns that the Modi government is trying to enshrine religious discrimination into law. 

This when Article 14 of India’s constitution prohibits discrimination on religious basis.

Why does this Act violate Article 14?

Article 14 is Equality of Law.

‘the state shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of laws within the territory of India prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth’

The opposition MPs had pointed this out but Amit Shah insisted the exception to Article 14, “reasonable classification” when making laws. 

In simple words the State can discriminate between citizens on above grounds if special benefits are offered to them for eg; reservations for marginalised communities.

This matter of whether “reasonable classification” is justified is why the Act is being contended in the Courts and will be decided later.

(b) How can CAA be misused?

CAA can be amended only by parliamentary procedures. 

The government has said that the amendment was made to provide remedy to the six communities namely Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi or Christian community from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan seeking shelter from religious persecution or fear of religious persecution.

However, religious persecution is not cited anywhere in the CAA, 2019. The bare act reads:

""Provided that any person belonging to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi or Christian community from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan, who entered into India on or before the 31st day of December, 2014 and who has been exempted by the Central Government by or under clause (c) of sub-section (2) of section 3 of the Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920 or from the application of the provisions of the Foreigners Act, 1946 or any rule or order made thereunder, shall not be treated as illegal migrant for the purposes of this Act;"" 



Religious persecution is actually mentioned under the Rules to the amended Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920.



This is very important to understand because the Government can make changes to these rules anytime they want. Rules are basically subordinate laws that the central government can issue through a gazette notification at any time. These laws do not require the approval of the parliament.


*The above point will be important while explaining NRC.

3. What is the NRC?

The National Register of Citizens (NRC) is a registry maintained by the Government of India containing names & certain relevant information for identification of Indian citizens. 

The Nationwide NRC is as a process already underway through the NPR, which is proposed to be implemented in the 2021 census.

(a) What is the NPR?

The NPR is a list of “usual residents of the country”. According to the Ministry of Home Affairs, a “usual resident of the country” is one who has been residing in a local area for at least the last six months, or intends to stay in a particular location for the next six months. 

Unlike the NRC, the NPR is not a citizenship enumeration drive, as it would record even a foreigner staying in a locality for more than six months.
 It is mandatory for every “usual resident of India” to register in the NPR.

The NPR will collect both demographic data and biometric data. There are 15 different categories of demographic data, ranging from name and place of birth to education and occupation, that the RGI is supposed to collect in the NPR. 

For biometric data it will depend on Aadhaar, for which it will seek Aadhaar details of the residents. This will allow the Union government, for the first time, to connect their biometric details with information like the birthplace of their parents.

Apart from this, in a test run going on across the country, the RGI is seeking details of mobile number, Aadhaar, PAN card, Driving Licence, Voter ID card and passport (in case the resident is Indian). It is also working to update the Civil Registration System of birth and death certificates.

Even as issues of privacy associated with Aadhaar continue to be debated in the country, the NPR is on a drive to collect detailed data on residents of India. With the recent introduction of Personal Data Protection Bill, in which the Centre exempts its agencies from some or all provisions of the proposed bill there are a lot of red flags being raised about misuse of such data.

(b) How is NPR linked to the NRC?

The legal framework for the National Population Register is grounded in the Citizenship Act, 1955. In 2003, the Act was amended by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led BJP government to introduce the category of an “illegal migrant”. To implement this amendment, a set of rules were issued. 

(The link to the rules is the same as 1. Are CAA and NRC different)

The rules read: “The Central Government shall, for the purpose of National Register of Indian Citizens, cause to carry throughout the country a house-to-house enumeration for collection of specified particulars relating to each family and individual, residing in a local area including the Citizenship status”.

How would these registers of citizens be created? The rules explicitly spell it out: 

“The Local Register of Indian citizens shall contain details of persons after due verification made from the Population Register.”

When the Local Register is generated from the Population Register, a “verification process” would be carried out which would create the category of “doubtful citizenship”. 

The final National Register of Citizens would be prepared by asking doubtful citizens to prove they are Indians as part of a “claims and objections” process.

This Population Register mentioned in the rules is nothing other than the National Population Register.

 In a gazette notification issued on July 31, 2019, the Modi government passed an order to “prepare and update the Population Register” in every state other than Assam.

(c) Arguments against NRC.

	(i).	A botched exercise in Assam

The National Register of Citizens in Assam was updated over the past few years to identify undocumented migrants who had come mostly from Bangladesh after 1971. 

The updated NRC was supposed to document all those people whose names were listed in the NRC of 1951 and were still alive as well as their living descendants who could prove they were permanent residents of the state.

It was a botched exercise. There were many errors during the process.
Source

 In all, around 19 lakh people in Assam were excluded from the final register. 
Source

Soon, the BJP started complaining that many undocumented immigrants had been included in the register, while around five lakh Bengali Hindus were excluded. In fact, even some people who had campaigned for the BJP found themselves excluded.

Source: BJP complaining about a botched NRC
Source: 5 lakh Bengali Hindus excluded in NRC
Source: BJP campaigners find themselves excluded

Anyone who is not able to prove citizenship under NRC is put in detention centres.
Reports of the violation of Human rights in these detention centres is alarming.

Source: A newborn died in a detention centre in Assam. Their mother was later found not to be a foreigner.


	(ii).	Loopholes and inconsistencies in the existing citizenship laws

There is a lot of speculation around cut off dates and proving of ancestry based on the pilot NRC launched in Assam but nothing concrete so far can be determined since the nation wide Bill hasn’t been drafted.

But one thing we know for sure - every person resident in India will be required to prove their citizenship.

How does one prove their citizenship?

This is where matters get complex.

If we don’t consider the speculated ancestry provision which may or may not be included in the nation wide NRC, The current law for citizenship is as follows -


The Citizenship Act defines a citizen as:

Section 3:

Citizenship by birth —

(1) Except as provided in sub-section (2), every person born in India,—
(a) on or after the 26th day of January, 1950, but before the 1st day of July, 1987;

(b) on or after the 1st day of July, 1987, but before the commencement of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2003 and either of whose parents is a citizen of India at the time of his birth;

(c) on or after the commencement of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2003, where—
(i) both of his parents are citizens of India; or
(ii) one of whose parents is a citizen of India and the other is not an illegal migrant at the time of his birth, 

shall be a citizen of India by birth.

Short of this is,

If you were born in India before 1987 but after 1950, you are a citizen.

If you were born after 1987 but before 2003 and either of your parents are Indian citizens, you are a citizen.

If you were born after 2003 and both your parents are Indian citizens or one of your parents is an Indian citizen and the other is not an illegal immigrant, you are a citizen.

So if you were born before 1987, you’re an Indian citizen by birth.

If you’re born after 1987 you have to prove that your parents are Indian citizens. (What about the orphans?)

How do you do it?

If you’re born before 1987, you can prove citizenship by provision of birth certificate or other documents as may be prescribed by the NRC.

Assuming your parents were educated and organised enough they would be able to preserve your birth certificate and other such documents but people from lower middle class or slightly under privileged backgrounds may not have done the same because they weren’t educated and informed enough about the importance of these documents. This leaves a person in a state of handicap.


If you’re born after 1987, considering that  almost 44% of India’s population is under  24 years of age and a total 85% of the population is under 54 years of age, we can safely conclude the above group constitutes a large chunk of India’s population.

You have to prove that at least one of your parents is an Indian citizen. So if you’re born after 1987 naturally your parents are born before 1987. You’ll have to provide the necessary documents of YOUR PARENTS
to prove THEY’RE Indian citizens. Basically they expect you to preserve and possess documents dating back to as much as the 1960’s.

Many news agencies are reporting that mere submitting of passports and Aadhar cards shall suffice and THIS IS ABSOLUTELY FALSE.

Mere submitting of passports, birth certificate shall not suffice to prove citizenship, this was ruled by Bombay high court in 2013.
Source

In conclusion,
67% of our population is still rural as per the 2015 census. This coupled with inadequate infrastructure and lacking admin capacities to implement a nationwide program like this would be a disaster.

	(iii).	Why NRC promotes inequality against the Muslims?

Imagine a scenario where a nationwide NPR is rolled out. The babus administering the exercise mess up and end up sending a whole bunch of people  of all faiths a “specified proforma” from the register. 


Now, a legal recourse is available only to people of the six religions mentioned in the CAA. Do note that the law specifically says that people belonging to these faiths “shall not be treated as illegal migrants"". Muslims, however, will not have any such recourse. For that matter, even Jews won’t be able to do anything about their exclusion from the register. 

As a result, lakhs and crores of excluded people might have to declare that they are illegal immigrants to become Indian citizens again.

The tricky part is proving religious  persecution in another country.

To benefit from the CAA, the person issued a specified proforma by the NPR must prove that, one, they are a non-Muslim migrant from Afghanistan, Pakistan or Bangladesh, 

and, two, that they came to India to escape religious persecution. 

*(read with the point mentioned in CAA) But because the Government can make the rules under the Passport Act essentially at whim, the government can simply strike out the second condition and keep only the first.

	(iv).	Economic cost

The Global economy is on a slowdown and India is no exception to it, I generally never attribute GDP numbers with a Government since the only active participation of a Government in a GDP is via public expenditure which is still crucial. However, when a Government actively makes policies which are detrimental to the state of the economy, then fingers will be pointed.

This is the case with NRC.

 In Assam alone it cost 1220 crores - 1500 crores and ended up in a massive failure.
Source:
 
The national cost of implementing the NRC would run into lakhs of crores. With the Indian economy in its current situation, implementing NRC would surely leave a visible dent on the Indian economy. Especially when there is absence of any ROI (Return on Investment) from such a policy.

The estimated cost of this might be close to 2-3 lakh crores (unverified).

Source: This is an opinion piece and the figures may have the effect of being inflated or underestimated.

Say, it costs 3 lakh crores, it’s still just 1.57% of our last year’s GDP i.e. $2.72 Trillion.

However, just like Demonetisation this act will bring the country to a halt. People will have to line up yet again at verification centres, for document verification, follow ups & enquiries. 

In Assam, the NRC updating started on July 30, 2018 and ended on August 31, 2019 and despite taking over an year to complete this process, the entire process ended up in material inconsistencies and glaring errors.
Source:

A nation-wide implementation would cost years in loss of productivity and the economic cost of this practice would be dangerous.

Demonetisation caused the GDP growth to drop to 6.1%, though it recovered in the later quarters and consumption patterns stabilised too.
Source:.

Over 1.5 million jobs were lost in Q3 of FY 2016-17 post implementation of demonetisation.
Source CMIE report.

The nation wide implementation of NRC will have a similar or larger impact on the economy but this time it will come with a substantial human cost.

	(v).	Cost of Error

The NRC exercise would be highly prone to error—both Type I and Type II. 

Explanation:

Type I errors:  False positives 

Mistakenly identifying a person as an immigrant from protected minority communities such as Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan, and erroneously giving them the benefit of Indian citizenship. 

Immigrants are usually a net economic benefit; so the costs of Type I errors are only confined to national security. 

These costs are not nationwide and typically limited to a handful of border districts in India.


Type II errors: False negatives

These occur when those who qualify as Indian citizens are mistakenly categorized as illegal immigrants. A nationwide NRC, if similar to the one in Assam, would imply that false negatives get sent to detention centres or deported.

Type II errors are extremely costly. To minimize false negatives, the bar to qualify as a citizen has to be very simple and easily identifiable. 

Also, infrastructure to scrutinize the paperwork for the NRC has to be exceptionally efficient. 

The Indian state usually fails on both counts. Given the CAB’s current religious exclusionary basis, Muslims are at higher risk of exclusion through false negatives, though all groups, including Hindus, are likely to be affected by errors.


There are three main issues to consider here. 


The first is the trade-off between Type I and Type II errors. 

If, to avoid false positives, the government has a high level of scrutiny for NRC inclusion, all individuals will have the burden of meeting this higher bar. In the process, some might be mistakenly excluded. 

On the other hand, if the bar is set very low to prevent false negatives and erroneous exclusions, then some illegal immigrants may slip through the cracks. 
The current CAB framework, combined with the NRC, is set up to minimize false positives, which will automatically increase false negatives.


The third issue is of the magnitude of error.

1) If Govt executes well with 5% error, 67.5 million people will be displaced (equalling displacement by WW II)

2) If it has Aadhaar error rate (8.8%) 120 million will be left out.

3) If it has 1% error, still 13.5 million Indians will be displaced (same as partition of India)

Both the source materials for the data above are opinion pieces since the numbers can only be estimated as of now and should be read accordingly.

Footnote:
Opinion -
There are a lot of narratives around the CAA and NRC but one thing that we need to stress on too is that illegal immigrants coming to India are disenfranchised and very poor. To blanket categorise them as some evil “infiltrators” stealing our lands and jobs is unfair and inhumane."
CAA-NRC-NPR,Not so frequently asked questions about NPR (yet),"**What is this NPR I am suddenly hearing about?**

NPR stands for National Population Register. It was defined and explained in the Citizenship Rules, 2003 (see link below), which were formed to execute the Citizenship Amendment Act of 2003. The first data collection for the NPR happened along with the last census in 2010. The data was then updated in 2015.

**Who is affected by this?**

Every ""usual resident"" of India. If you generally live in an area in India (for past 6 months or more, or plan to live for next 6 months or more), you are required to provide the data. It covers you whether you are a citizen or not. On the other hand, citizens who are not normally resident (NRIs) are not covered.

**Oh, so it's like census in regards of who it covers and the way it is collected. What kind of data do they want?**

Some of the data is similar to the census form.

**Huh? But we already have the census for that. Why do we need this?**

Well, the census data collection comes under the Census act of 1948 and that data cannot be used for any other activity. The purpose of that data is to use it for planning and other welfare programs. It's confidential and anonymized.

The NPR data is collected under the Citizenship Act of 1955 and Citizenship Amendment Act of 2003. It won't be anonymized, nor will it be confidential. The purpose for this data is to help ascertain citizenship of an individual.

**What is different this time vs the 2010 collection?**

The differences are really the key. From a questionnaire taken from a pilot project that began in August, apparently you will now also need to tell the place of birth of your parents (do you have an idea of why they would need that? Wink, wink). This is a new data point and was not there in the original NPR (2010) data collection.

Also for the first time - you will be asked for numbers of your Aadhaar, driver's license, voter identity card, and mobile phone, if you have them. 

And did I tell you it's not planned to be anonymized or secured?

**Goodness! When is this happening?**

There was a gazette notification (see link below) issued in July 2019 by the government to prepare and update the Population Register in every state other than Assam. The field work will happen between April 1 and Sep. 30 of 2020. Expect a knock on your door then.

**But why are some people tying it to the NRC? It has nothing to do with that, right?**

Actually, the whole purpose of the National Population Register (NPR) is to collect the primary data for the National Register of Citizenship (NRC). This is really the first step. The NPR is supposed to create a list of all the residents of the country and then the NRC would take that list and identify people of “doubtful citizenship” – thus, by corollary creating a list of citizens."" (See the Rules document linked below)

**Hmm.. ""Doubtful citizenship"" sounds like a vague term. Who is going to determine that?**

Once you submit the data for the NPR, it will be verified for the purposes of preparation and inclusion in the NRC. The Local Registrar and their helper staff will scrutinize every single data point for each individual to come up with that decision. If they find that you citizenship is ""doubtful"" they will add a remark in the Population Register and inform you after the process is over.

**Don't tell me that “doubtful citizen” remark will really be used for the NRC.**

Come on. Of course it will be. We are not paying our Baabus for nothing. The final National Register of Citizens would be prepared by asking doubtful citizens to prove they are Indians as part of a “claims and objections” process.

**So, then it's my responsibility to remove the doubts of Sarkaari Baabus to be considered a citizen?**

Yes, but hey, you also have a right to cast doubt on others. A draft of the local register of the NRC will be publicly available. You can actually check your nosy neighbor's details and if your relationship is not cordial, can cast doubt on their information. You can object to the citizenship or a particular information of anyone before it goes into the final NRC. Of course, others can do that to you as well. But can't you pay a small price for .. erm.. eh.. the country?

They constantly espouse and spout beliefs such as ""10 years till the Muslims kills us all"" and ""Muslims go against the fabric of India"" and ""All these Muslims want to establish a  Ghazwa-e-Hind"". 
I am at my wits' end battling their predisposed notions of Muslims, despite them all being highly educated members of society.

Hell, I even forcibly took them to watch Chapaak because they parroted this idiotic newspiece that claimed that the acid attacker's name was changed from Muslim to Hindu because they didn't want to offend the Muslim community as they will riot. (Naturally they were soon disabused of that notion).

Nothing I have done has worked, and it really drives me up a wall when they continue to spread these virulent items of fake news. 

Have any of you gotten to your family, and if so how? I am on the verge of giving up.

CAA-NRC-NPR,Hindus are not in danger. Economy and democracy are in danger.,"Hindu khatre mein nahi hai. Economy aur democracy khatre mein hai.

It's is often said by sanghis who claim that 'Hindu khatre mein hain' and that india will become Muslim majority by 2050, however the reality is that even if Hindus do not have any children and if the Muslim population grows at a rate of 2% per year, the Muslim population will only be about 360 million(36 crore) and for the Muslim population to even reach the current level of hindu population it will take about 80 years growing at a constant rate of 2%.

This 2% isn't even their actual growth rate, it's even lesser.

In 1951 census, the population of India was 360.9 million(36.09 crore) out of which 303.6 million(30.36) was Hindu and Muslim was 35.4 million(3.54 crore), in 2011 census, the population of India was 1.21 billion(121 crore)  of which hindu population was about 965.6 million(96.56 crore) and Muslim population was about 171.8 million(17.18 crore).

So this means, from 1951 to 2011 census, the contribution of population growth of Hindus is about 78% and Muslims is about 16%. So no, india is not going to be Muslim majority and taken over in 2050 or something along those lines, it is just fear mongering by sanghis.

Also since india became more developed compared to 1951, the fertility rate has come down across ALL religions. More developed areas have lower fertility rates in general.

Right now, democracy and economy are in danger.

Our GDP has been the lowest at 4.5% since the past 6 years. You can't have $5 trillion economy in 2024, if the economy is slowing down like this, we need a double digit growth to accomplish, yet since every quarter, the economic growth is sliding down.

Several sectors of the economy are experiencing negative growth. This [article](https://thewire.in/economy/facing-the-reality-how-can-modi-reverse-the-current-economic-slowdown) explains the problems pretty well and also talks about solutions.

As we also know democracy is also under threat, look what's happening in UP, Delhi and many other places, dissent is being shutdown. Many protesters are getting beaten, getting shot, some of them are getting killed. Dissent is also stopped by bringing internet shutdowns. India accounts for 67% of all internet shut downs, that happen across the world, the internet shutdowns in kashmir has been longer than 145 days, longest ever in a democracy. India has the most number of internet shutdowns in the world by far. India's rank in freedom of press index is dropping.

The opposition to CAA is being called 'anti-nationals' as usual. The CAA-NPR-NRC is deadly combo, it will have their way for a Hindu rastra and therefore it would be the end of a secular democracy. it will strip millions of Muslim of their citizenship. The financial cost of this will be insane.

The NRC in Assam costed about Rs. 1,220 crores which has a population of 30.6 million(3.06 crore) which is about 2.2% of india's population. Out of that, 1.9 million(19 lakh) were could'nt prove their citizenship. The cost of this would be Rs. 399 per person.

If we apply this to whole nation, whose population is 1.37 Billion(137 crore), it would be about Rs. 55,000 crore. Building one detension centre in Assam, which could detain about 3,000 people costed about Rs. 45 crore.

Detaining even 50 million(5 crore) people, this would cost about Rs. 7.5 lakh crore. For comparison total budgetary expenditure for health and education was Rs. 8.4 lakh crore in 2018-19. This whole CAA-NPR-NRC is not only extremely discriminatory but also financially terrible."

CAA-NRC-NPR,Some thoughts on those not protesting or discussing the CAA and NRC/NPR issue,"The people who have been protesting and who have been seen protesting are just a fraction or
the minority of the total population of the country. There is still the majority of the people who
continue their lives as normal and have not commented on this issue. 
These protests are said to be driven by the youth but the youth we are seeing protesting are only a small fraction of the total youth. Even among the social workers and NGO workers there are only a small fraction of them who are commenting or sharing their support on social media. 
This is a major issue asthese people are uncaring and unconcerned not just about this issue but other major issues unless it directly affects and impacts them. They are also fearful and a bit lazy for not reading up on these issues and thus not understanding their importance and consequences.
There have been attempts during these protests to shame these people into showing their
support however by and large the majority of society still remains quiet and continuing their lives
as usual.
There needs to be more engagement by this section of the society as they cannot be neutral or
unconcerned with the ruling party doing door to door campaigns about the CAA and NRC/NPR
and also encouraging the people to call a number to show their support for it. 
They should thennot complain when the time comes when they are forced to stand in long queues with theirdocuments and told that they can't be put on the NRC/NPR or have to hunt for their documents and pay a huge amount for them to agents and those in the government offices.
 The teachers, concerned workers and others with knowledge on this issue need to engage with the people on this issue and try to get these people more involved or at least more enlightened."

CAA-NRC-NPR,The problem with the anti-CAA protests is the messaging adopted by the liberals and the leftists,"The CAA is a mistake. That much is certain. But unfortunately some of the messaging I've seen seems to harp on the fact that the CAA and the NRC will somehow benefit Hindus while affecting Muslims, while this is not obvious and I don't know if it is true.   
  
The CAA is for Hindus/Jains/Buddhists/Parsis/Christians from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh, right? So if the CAA is introduced, it would prevent Indian born Muslims from being able to establish their citizenship during the NRC, if the NRC is done stupidly like it was done in Assam. That much is clear. Then these Muslims would have to wait for 11 years to be able to apply for citizenship in India, in the meantime losing their assets and their right to work or free movement within India. That's fucked up. Almost everyone knows this. 
  
But if the NRC is introduced, that would also exclude *India* born Hindus who can't prove their citizenship from being able to apply for citizenship, right? So *India* born Hindus and other minorities like Sikhs or Parsis or Siddis can *also* get fucked, right? The CAA explicitly says it only accommodates for refugees from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh. If a hypothetical non-Muslim family cannot prove they are from India *or* the other 3 countries, they get fucked, right? What are they supposed to do? Forget the obvious examples of tribals or migrants. What is a family living in a MHADA compound in Mumbai supposed to do? What about Koli fishermen? 
  
So why are the anti-CAA protests revolving solely around how it will affect only Muslims? It will affect every single person in India. Even assuming a best case scenario and an error rate of just 5%, it will still affect 50 million people. It will affect everyone - not just Congress voters or ""libtards"" or ""sickulars"". It will affect bhakts also.   
  
Why are bhakts even supporting and defending this nonsense? They should be opposing this too, since (like DeMo) this will affect them a lot too. In fact, I now notice bhakts now criticizing DeMo when they blindly supported it in 2016.   
  
I predict they will begin criticizing CAA/NPR/NRC about CAA/NPR/NRC in a few years when some of their own citizenships come into question - because remember, depending on when the government sets the cutoff for NRC, we have to establish our citizenship to before that date by proving ""ancestry"" and not being perceived as a ""doubtful citizen"" : both these terms have no provision for legal documentation. How do I prove ancestry? What are ancestral documents?   
  
The BJP is arrogantly setting itself up for yet another clusterfuck purely motivated by 2 things: a hatred for Muslims, and the quest to plunder as much of India as possible. Remember, if we are declared ""doubtful"" citizens then while we are ""under trials"" to get on the NRC, the government can seize our assets as far as I know.  
  
Seriously it boggles my mind that bhakts who can also be affected by this issue are supporting it. This is not a Muslim vs Hindu or a liberal vs secular issue. This is a common sense vs brain dead arrogance issue. This is not a ""their side"" vs ""our side"" thing at all, even though the messaging has been about that. This potentially fucks every single Indian irrespective of political preferences, gender, ethnicity, caste or religion. Its complete madness.  
  
There are better ways to do this. I mena even the elections are done in a phased manner. If the BJP is desperate to root out illegal immigrants, then they should think 5000 times before putting a country through something that will fuck it raw again. 2016 was enough."
CAA-NRC-NPR,Latur | Dec 21 | Anti CAA-NPR-NRC Protests | Panorama Nokia 6,
CAA-NRC-NPR,The problem with current CAA protests - from a right wingers perspective,"Note: The post is based on the fundamental premise that India needs to meet these objectives,

a. Secure borders and eliminate any illegal immigration 

b. Deport any illegal immigrants 

If you do not agree to these points, viz. you strongly believe in open borders, we cant have any meaningful discussion - and just agree to disagree. 

Post: The current problems with the CAA protests as I perceive them,

1. Blanket refusal stating 'kagaz nahi dikhayenge' - this is not a great stratgey. Rather, there should be solid proposals from them on how to meet the objectives stated above. If NPR and CAA are unacceptable, what should be alternate methods to achieve these objectives? 

2. Citizenship extension to all illegal immigrants except muslims - this obviously is the crux of the matter, because this aspect clearly discriminates between ilegal immigrants based on their religion. The question then becomes, are anti CAA protestors, protesting on the behalf of Hazaras, Ahmadis and Rohingyas? If so, India already has a system in place to naturalize persecuted minorities so I dont understand why this is such a contentious issue. 

As I see it, albeit with all my biases, the protests  are a boiling over of the suppressed anger against 370, Babri, triple talaq and the soon to be uniform civil code. Also center/left leadership are inciting fear of minority deportation, for political gains. 

Tl;dr - rather than seemingly directionless and rigid protests, anti CAA movement should come up with alternate(s) on a better way to achieve anti--illegal immigration objectives.

*** 

Seeing that the thread has crossed a 100 comments, now is as good a time as any to summarize things and give a final perspective from my pov,

1. While there was a great deal of participation and discussion, it mostly centered around why the CAA+NRC must be repealed as a whole, without any real, better alternative that could meet the objectives 

2. It was clear that there is a great deal of fear and anger over the suspicion that legal muslim citizens will be deported enmasse, but as to what evidence this sentiment is based on was quite unclear 

3. There were also multiple occasions when participants wanted to challenge the premise of stricter immigration laws and whether they are even a truly pressing issue - to this all I want to say on this point is that while there are economic arguments on both sides, this is also an emotive issue for RW folks like me, it is not necessary that it make a strong economic case (which I strongly feel it does). Whether you choose to agree or disagree, it is important that we understand each other on this, personal attacks online or now as we are seeing in the real world, will only dilute and belittle the anti CAA stance. 

If nothing else, this thread helped me better empathize with those of the opposing view, at least their fears and motivations. 

Thanks for your participation."
CAA-NRC-NPR,What's next for the CAA+NPR+NRC protests,"In the aftermath of the Delhi pogrom, the spotlight the protests were occupying seems to be diminishing with every passing day. 

Moreover most of the talk about the pogroms is emotionally charged gossip. The AAP's complicity by not taking any action at all, and failing miserably with connecting with public, is conveniently being neglected. AAP needs to make amends. We can still look up to AAP in the hope that they are unlike BJP.

The onus should not be on the victims to be left to fight for themselves.  When all the institutions of the establishment fail, the civil society must to step in. Some altruistic people are already taking good steps by volunteering relief material but the scale is abysmal. The victims are left at the benevolence of a few, the state is turning away, the judiciary is abdicating from its responsibilities. Like what kinda mess is this. I hope more people can offer help other than just pity and the state addresses the situation with the urgency that it begs. 


Aside from that, we must remind ourselves that the CAA, NPR and NRC monster is still lurking. It hasn't gone away. India isn't in good hands. The establishment is trying too hard to suppress dissent and they seem to get away with every illegal thing they do. They have a great sense of entitlement. But the protests must go on to protect the idea of India our forefathers had envisioned, to protect the values enshrined in our constitution.  

You guys, don't get demotivated with all the bad stuff thats happening. The real good days, we will snatch them back."

CAA-NRC-NPR,Contrasting logic behind CAA/NPR/NRC protest and Support.,"So this one time I was waiting for metro to arrive at the platform. This guard was talking to a college kid. He said ""Saale bahar se aake yaha do manjila ghar bana liye hain .. ab sabit karo .. show karna padega isiliye inki fati padi hai (for protestors)."" .. so I could not resist and intervene, asked him how would you prove your citizenship? he said I have adhaar PAN card etc. .. When I told him, this wouldn't work you would have to furnish the birth certificate of not only your’s, but your father’s, and every member of family .. he said I know some Vidhayak ji and went to this Bhokal attitude. I also asked him if he actually believes that landless labours in village and many people in rural areas would have any kind of paper to support their citizenship ?? and how much of corruption, scam would take place … He still kept on denying by presenting his Bhokal of knowing this Vidhayak and “sab nikalwa lunga”.

So the second logic I am presenting is, If PRO NPR/CAA/NRC guys argue that this law is for giving citizenship and not taking away, why do they so vehemently oppose **reservations**?!?!? Because it provides job to the needy and does not takes anyone’s job .. ask any BJP supporter out there and he’ll tell you how much he hates this reservation thing .. and yet he takes this contrasting stand when it comes to NRC/NPR/CAA."

CAA-NRC-NPR,The 5 step-game of NPR+NRC+CAA,"NRP - NRC -CAA is the same thing, Don't be confused by all these names, This is just to confuse the common man.

# First Step - CENSUS [aka NPR]

Some govt. officials will visit your place and will ask you the following questions

1. Your name
2. Your Date of Birth
3. Your parent's name and place of birth
4. Some sort of paper just to confirm your identity, ""NOTHING RELATED TO YOUR CITIZENSHIP"" such as maybe your Aadhar number, Voter ID card.

# Second Step - The D factor [Doubtful Citizen]

After a few months, all the data from NPR will be collected and some Government officials will check the whole list and if you weren't able to answer a few questions such as - Your Parent's exact age, their DoB, your own Aadhar number just because it's been month you applied and haven't received it or any other reason not mentioned here then that official will simply put a ""D"" in front of your name i.e. Doubtful Citizen.

# Third Step - NRC

If your name is in the new filtered list of Doubtful Citizens then you will have to ""Prove your Citizenship""

How?

The government has not published any such guidelines as per now but we can understand from the example of Assam: Aadhar Card, Name in the Voter list, name in Ration card list can nothing prove your Citizenship, It was also said by Amit Shah repeatedly in his speeches and interviews recently.

Source: [https://www.siasat.com/aadhaar-voter-id-passport-not-proof-citizenship-govt-1769667/](https://www.siasat.com/aadhaar-voter-id-passport-not-proof-citizenship-govt-1769667/) \[The link also has a video interview, Just in case if you like watching his face and listening to his voice, otherwise believe me and read further\]

You will have to present documents which should prove where you were born 30 years ago if you were not born then you will have to show the documents of your parents or grandparents, any property documents maybe. If you are able to provide the proofs then you are safe, If not then you will be filtered out once again, Hence the 4th step.

# Fourth Step - Foreigners Tribunal

This will be your last chance to prove that you are Citizen of  Bangladesh, Pakistan or Afghanistan, If you are Muslim then you stand no chance because CAA will be activated here even if you prove that you were a citizen of any of the above countries. If others are not able to prove their Citizenship then they will also be labeled as Foreigners.

# Fifth Step - Detention Centers [JAIL FOR FOREIGNERS]

6 detention centers are already functioning in Assam, Constructions of detention Centers has already begun in other states.

**~~\[NSFW\]~~**  I typed a long paragraph about the life in the Detention Center but then  I realized that you guys like Truth but do not the BRUTAL HONESTY. So let's skip that part.

# How to stop this 5-step plan?

It's VERY SIMPLE, As soon the government begins with the first step we need to boycott it immediately because once people are filtered out then it will be too easy for the government to handle us because then they have to handle only a few of use and they exactly know which one of us.

You are not alone, ""We the people of India"" is a group formed by more than 120 organizations throughout the country has given a call to boycott the NPR \[Press release attached at the end\]

How to boycott this process:

If officials visit your place then don't be angry on them, They are not Sanghi (some of them might be), They are the government officials who will be doing this government survey, Offer them water, tea, ask them to even have a seat if you would like that but just politely tell them that you won't be sharing any details with them as it is unconstitutional, Don't give any papers, Don't share any information with them verbally. They will try to tell you that it's a Government survey and it's unconstitutional but take a stand and deny the information politely.

Now I know very well that a lot of my fellow Hindu brothers and ~~sisters~~ females might be thinking that I will give them the papers because mom-dad will yell at me but yeah I will stand against this CAA and NPR during protests, I will go to Shaheen Bagh, No way. It won't work that way, The government will start picking up people one by one after that because just for an example If 1000 people are living in a locality then 770 might show papers then they have to handle only 30 people now, They very well know how to handle 30 people.

I am leaving a video in the comments sections, The same concept explained in Hindi by Yogendra Yadav, share that video with your Driver, Servant, Vegetable Vendor or anyone you know might not have the papers despite caring about their religion. It might change someone's perspective.

CAA-NRC-NPR,What are the realistic options/pathways to defeat Modi in 2024? I have worked with the BJP they have a working plan till 2029 and going quite as planned!,"With the way things are going, I have little doubt that the country is being irreparably polarised and Modi is going to come back riding another wave in 2024 elections! But to stop that we need a realistic plan.  I know multiple top RSS functionaries because of my previous job and in my exchanges, with them it's clear they are not going to back down on any of these CAA-NPR-NRC. They will just change the timeline for NRC which I had known before the CAA was even announced as their preferred timeline for the same is 2023-2029. Amit Shah was just trying to test the waters and making an attempt to bulldoze the NRC. I worked alongside Prashant Kishor in 2013-2014 for the BJP and then as an independent consultant directly with the BJP for Assam elections in 2016. Hence have seen them very closely and even now talk to a lot of them. They are on a plan. what are we doing? Any implementable idea as to how that can be done without risking a Civil war or endangering the integrity of the country?

#PAST
*****
The Kargil War happened on 1999. Post the war(and India's victory),

>The Kargil Review Committee (KRC) was set up by the Government of India on 29 July 1999 three days after the Kargil War came to an end. The committee was set up ""to examine the sequence of events and make recommendations for the future,"" as mentioned in the epilogue of the final report and the ""Terms of Reference"" laid down in the executive summary.
> 
> Over a hundred senior military, civil service and intelligence officials, politicians, including former prime ministers, diplomats and journalists were interviewed by the high-powered committee over a period of five months. The report was completed on 15 December 1999 and tabled in the Parliament of India on 23 February 2000.Certain parts of the final KRC report, such as the findings, have remained confidential till date.

>Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kargil_Review_Committee

Another source suggests :
> A comprehensive systemic overhaul of the country's security and intelligence apparatus in keeping with the technological revolution and the need for integrated management structures was unfolded by the Group of Ministers (GOM) in a report submitted by them to PM on February 26, 2001. The GOM had been set up in April 2000 to review the national security system in its entirety and in particular to consider the recommendations of the Kargil Review Committee and formulate specific proposals for implementation. The GOM under the Chairmanship of Shri L.K. Advani also included the Defence Minister, External Affairs Minister and Finance Minister.

>Source:  http://pibarchive.nic.in/archive/releases98/lyr2001/rmay2001/23052001/r2305200110.html

One among a huge list of things discussed in **GOM report of 2001** is ""Border Management"" (there are some redacted bits shown as dotted line further below). The initial sections give the rationale behind the importance of ""Border Management"":

> **Chapter V:BORDER MANAGEMENT**
> 
> India has 14,880 kms of land border running through 92 districts in 17 States and a coastline of 5,422 kms touching 12 States and Union Territories (UTs). India also has a total of 1197 islands accounting for 2094 kms of additional coastline. There are 51 Bangladeshi enclaves (area involved 7,110.02 acres) in India and 111 Indian enclaves (area involved 17,158.13 acres) in Bangladesh. In fact, barring Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Delhi and Haryana, all other States in the country have one or more international borders or a coastline and can be regarded as frontline States from the point of view of border management.

the report goes on to say...
> Illegal migration from across our borders has continued unabated for over five decades. We have yet to fully wake up to the implications of the unchecked immigration for the national security. Today, we have about 15 million Bangladeshis, 2.2 million Nepalese, 70,000 Sri Lankan Tamils and about one lakh Tibetan migrants living in India. Demographic changes have been brought about in the border belts of West Bengal, several districts in Bihar, Assam, Tripura and Meghalaya as a result of large-scale illegal migration. Even States like Delhi, Maharashtra and Rajasthan have been affected. Such large-scale migration has obvious social, economic, political and security implications. There is an all-round failure in India to come to grips with the problem of illegal immigration. 

>**Unfortunately, action on this subject invariably assumes communal over-tones with political parties taking positions to suit the interest of their vote banks.** The massive illegal immigration poses a grave danger to our security, social harmony and economic well being.
 
In the recommendations under this ""Border Management"", the report says:

> **ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION**
> 
> **Illegal migration has assumed serious proportions. There should be compulsory registration of citizens and non-citizens living in India. This will facilitate preparation of a national register of citizens. All citizens should be given a Multi-Purpose National Identity Card (MPNIC)** and non-citizens should be issued identity cards of a different colour and design. This should be introduced initially in the border districts or may be in a 20 Kms border belt and extended to the hinterland progressively. The Central Government should meet the full cost of the identity card scheme. Many people from the neighbouring countries [……………………..]* are tempted to cross over to India in search of better job opportunities. In order to prevent illegal migration in future, a 'Work Permit for Foreigners' scheme may be introduced, [……………………………………………….].* 

>A proposal for introduction of multi-purpose identity cards to all citizens and compulsory registration of nationals and non-nationals in the country is already under the consideration of the Central Government.

There is a mention of this ""Multi-purpose National Identity Card"" in the PIB archive from 2001 - apparently the Govt was supposed to start implementation of this waay back in 2001: http://pibarchive.nic.in/archive/ArchiveSecondPhase/HOME%20AFFAIR/2001-JAN-JUNE-HOME-AFFAIRS/PDF/HOM-2001-03-20_047.pdf

The recommendations on ""border management"" goes on as follows:

> For effective action against the illegal migrants, Residence Records of villages in the border districts should be prepared and regularly updated. This will allow easy identification and detection of illegal immigrants, until such time as the scheme of registration of all nationals and non-nationals is introduced.
> 
> **Indian Census primary data can easily help in the detection of illegal immigrants**. This information can be a useful tool in establishing the status of illegal migrants. However, since census primary data is confidential in nature, this matter needs to be further discussed with the Registrar General of India and the Ministry of Law.

A further section titled ""Citizenship, Passport, Immigration and Refugee Law"" under recommendations states:

> Children born to illegal immigrants living in India are entitled to claim Indian citizenship by virtue of their birth on Indian soil. **Therefore, in principle, Indian Citizenship Act should be amended prohibiting acquisition of citizenship rights by the children of illegal migrants born in India before 1 August 1987**. This would also meet the stipulations of the Assam Accord. However, as per the advice of the Ministry of Law, the provision can only be introduced with prospective effect. 
> 
> The MHA should take necessary action.
> 
> **As soon as the situation becomes more *propitious* for enacting a law in this regard, a law, for compulsory registration of all Indian national and non-nationals staying in India, should be enacted. This would help in preparing the National Register of Indian Citizens.**

And there you have the first mention of the NRIC - almost 20 years in the making. Looking at the Govt's actions recently with amendment act, the ""propitious"" time seems to be now in 2019. The actual digitized copy of the GOM report of 2001 is nowhere to be found in our Indian Gov websites but there is a version of it in one website: https://www.vifindia.org/sites/default/files/GoM%20Report%20on%20National%20Security.pdf

As a result of this report being submitted and being accepted by the Govt at that time(2001), a flurry of changes happened thereafter. One of which is enactment of ""The Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003"". This actually details the process and framework by which to build the NRIC (National Register of Indian Citizens as http://www.censusindia.gov.in/ states it) and eventually enforce the reality of a ""Multi-purpose National Identity Card"". We should have had the initial ground work for something akin Aadhar way back in 2003 but it never happened. (Read it in full here: http://censusindia.gov.in/2011-Act&Rules/notifications/citizenship_rules2003.pdf)

This framework for gathering information, verifying, issuing citizenship remained as is without much progress till the November 2008 Mumbai attacks. After that, the government was quick to plan and deploy the exercise to create the National Population Register (NPR) for all residents, a precursor to the NRIC. The NPR has been created and digitised (check out http://censusindia.gov.in/2011-Common/IntroductionToNpr.html and https://npr-rgi.nic.in). The Govt then amended the Citizenship Rules,2003 with a Citizenship (amendment) Bill of 2009 (and few amendments happened in later years as well) to initiate the pilot NRC program in Assam.

#PRESENT
*****
We can infer that, together, the Citizenship Rules,2003 and The Citizenship Act, 1955 have been amended multiple times over the years to support the eventual creation of a nationalized NRC(aka NRIC) with Assam being the pilot. The most recent one being tabled in 2016 - the infamous CAB - **Citizenship \(Amendment\) Bill** 2016. As mentioned earlier, we will not go into the details of what the CAB means to the overall 'citizenship' debate and what issues people in north eastern region(specifically Assam) are facing due to NRC and CAB.

The bill is an ""Act"" now. Hence the media outlets have started referring to this as CAA,2019 - Citizenship \(Amendment\) Act of 2019.

> The Bill was introduced in Lok Sabha on 19 July 2016 as the Citizenship \(Amendment\) Bill, 2016. It was referred to the Joint Parliamentary Committee on 12 August 2016. The Committee submitted its report on 7 January 2019.
> 
> Subsequently, the Union Cabinet cleared the Citizenship \(Amendment\) Bill, 2019, on 4 December 2019 for introduction in the parliament. The Bill was introduced in 17th Lok Sabha by the Minister of Home Affairs Amit Shah on 9 December 2019 and was passed on 10 December 2019, with 311 MPs voting in favour and 80 against the Bill.
> 
> The bill was subsequently passed by the Rajya Sabha on 11 December 2019 with 125 votes in favour and 105 votes against it. Those voted in favour included BJP allies such as Janata Dal \(United\), AIADMK, Biju Janata Dal, TDP and YSR-Congress, apart from BJP.
> 
> After receiving assent from the President of India on 12 December 2019, the bill assumed the status of an act. The act will come into force on a date chosen by the Government of India, and will be notified as such.

#FUTURE
*****
Salt: It is obvious that this section will be based on pure hunch/informed opinion...

There *seems* to have been very extensive work done in early 2000s after Kargil war, to increase India's resistance and resilience to such events in the future. To a large part, that(Kargil committee report and the GOM report 2001 on the back of Kargil report) *seems* to be one of the most influential(you can see it mentioned in many annual reports the Home ministry/Defense ministry publishes: https://mha.gov.in/documents/annual-reports) and thorough review of national security - at least the one publicly available. So it is *expected* that (unless a review happens in that scale again) the Govt will follow the process/methods/framework suggested in The Citizenship Rules,2003 and would eventually try to create a baseline NRIC from Census data(as suggested in the GOM recommendations 2001) - *possibly* from up coming Census in 2021.

After so many amendments over the years, The Citizenship Act, 1955 and The Citizenship Rules, 2003 as they stand currently have specific rules to infer citizenship in the ""Assam"" context, but has a very generic rules if it were to be extended to entire India. So there *could* be further amendments tabled so that it is tailored for the various regions across India that share international borders and are bound to have issues in 'identification of a citizen' due to that particular territories regional history(take Tamil Nadu, the Eelam issue and SriLanka for example...)

Steps *may* be taken to ensure the NPR(National Population Register) data is made more reliable and robust. The data from which *may* be used to baseline NRIC(National Register of Indian Citizens) - ground work for this *seems* to have already started based on Govt's actions. Aadhar *may* be re-purposed to become the actual Multi-purpose National Identity Card that the 2001 GOM report initially suggested. Given most countries around the world are moving towards a ""surveillance state"", this move of formalizing 'citizenship' and digitizing that data will give the Govt strong base for full fledged surveillance power. 

India doesn't have robust personal information protections in this digital age(compared to GDPR rules governing PII data in EU for example). So there is no telling how census data(personal in nature) may be used in the future. Is this a good or a bad future we are heading towards? How do they intend to use it? will they abuse it? will this NRIC plan even get fulfilled and a true national ID issued to citizens? - Time will tell

**Q:** Doesn't the CAB 2016 (CAA 2019) violate basic rights/some laws of equality at the least?

**A:** Do you think Bills and Acts get tabled and passed with a few politicians hurling words at each other in Parliament?? NO! thank God we (still) have civil servants in our Govt, upholding due legislative processes.
