"2/3rds of what my family shares with me over social media is fake. Fake news, health tips, advice, stories, quotes. They are all aware of the fake news issues but still exercise no caution. With my parents I used to explain it to them, but they would never take heed. I finally got them to stop and exercise caution by openly embarrassing them in group chats by disproving their stories. But I can't do this with my relatives (my parents are laid back).

It honestly seems like most of the information that gets passed around in India is either fake or selective, only reading the stories that match your outlook. 

One instance that angered me a lot was when my uncle shared a video of Muslims in Karnataka rioting against dalits. I noticed all the signboard in this video were in Bengali, I looked it up and found it was a video of a riot in Bangladesh from 10 years back. I told this to him, and told him there was no Muslim rioting in Karnataka. He responded even if it's fake the ""meaning"" is real. wtf is that supposed to mean?

In speaking to a Muslim co worker she informed she gets similar fake news only in reverse. Photos of Palestine and Iraq getting passed over as Kashmir or Uttar Pradesh.

Fake news is making communities live in their own separate fictional realities. And these days people spent more time online then they do speaking to those in their neighborhood. Our reality is warped.

And that's just for politics. Forget the ridiculous claims that cancer can be treated by drinking fruit juice and that Buddha gives advice on how to make lots of money.

Honestly after some thinking I think the root of fake news is confirmation bias. People want to share and believe news that confirms how they already feel. Since most Indians have this false belief that ""natural"" = good they automatically believe claims that fruit juice cures cancer and vaccines cause autism. Only way to fight it is to challenge the belief that natural is not good by default. Same with my dumbass uncle, who thinks Muslims are troublemakers and thus will share any such news even if he knows it's fake.",Non-Political

"Anyone worried that a Riot might break out ? While the Lockdown is happening with varying degrees of effectiveness across the country, there are many who criticize its implementation and effectiveness. But what's done is done and there's no use debating it further, atleast until all of this blows over.

What I am worried about is people feeling like they are being repressed against their best interests and retaliating en masse.

Currently, the people are ignoring the Lockdown due to two reasons.

1. They don't understand the seriousness of the situation. 

2. They don't have enough supplies and/or are worried about their survival

The Police cracking down on them using violence might instill the idea that the Lockdown is implemented not for their benefit. A lack of certainty about essential commodities adds more fuel to the fire. Reading about the situation in Goa, I couldn't help but feel that the people are on the verge of their breaking point. And if the situation in the Hospitals reaches a point where, like in Italy, the Doctors have to choose whose life to save, I can't imagine how the people would react.

I don't mean to cause unnecessary panic or worry to the people reading this post. I just want to know whether the Government has considered this ( I am trying to be optimistic here ) and have a proper plan in place to avoid it. I would also like to know if people like me can help spread awareness and help alleviate the situation.",Food

"Watching movies in India is a truly unique experience. Seriously, there is no dearth of weird shit that can happen. I went to watch Joker in an afternoon show and here is a list of things that happened.

1. Some guys came with Heath Ledger type facepaint and saste ka clown masks. They were denied entry because they didn't have ID to prove they were above 18. This bunch of Joker ""anarchists"" was then seen begging the security to let them in.

2. I overheard a guy was telling his girlfriend that Heath Ledger would make a cameo in this movie. I thought he was pranking her but he seemed to be convinced.

3. Another group of people (who I had the unfortunate experience of sitting next to later) were chanting anarchy slogans as they entered the theater. They were asked to shut up by the ushers. These same bunch proceeded to take videos and photos of ""iconic"" clips from the movie, sometimes with their flash on. Thankfully they were thrown out.

4. Someone's family member apparently died/hospitalized in the climax of the movie and he began crying loudly while on the call. He ran out after a few seconds but some people who were next to him were genuinely confused about whether to ask him to shut up or not.

5. I spotted a celebrity photographer in the theater watching the movie with his wife. I used to love his early work and it sort of inspired me into getting into amateur photography. I was contemplating throughout the movie what I will say to him or will he be cool to take a picture with me etc. I had them locked on while they were exiting and ended up standing right next to them in the dark exit hallway walking out. As I was about to talk to him, he and his wife started having an argument. I just continued walking past them and left thanks to the awkwardness.

Thoughts about the movie? It's great. Just try going for a show where you can avoid the college crowd. Dunno why these people worship The Joker.",Photography

"[Tech Question] Which 4k TV as a Monitor (Non-Gaming). Hello,

I have a HP Omen 15 (2019 Model) with a RTX 2060. I want to use a 43"" 4k tv as an everyday monitor now. I read a lot about the Chroma 4:4:4:4 ratings and how they are very important for the texts to be clear. Now, does anybody use a 4k tv with the Chroma 4:4:4:4 ratings? Can you please tell me about the model and brand of the tv and hopefully a picture of how clear the texts are on the websites?

Also, Can my graphic card support the 43"" 4K TV? 

P.S: I am looking at this as a replacement for the bulky 4 FHD monitor setup i currently have. I would primarily be using this monitor for a web dashboard related work and not for gaming. All i need is a lot of screen real estate. At least enough to have 4 chrome pages adjacent to each other.

"I've never been so angry and frustrated with the Government. While the privileged are sitting at homes, doing pointless shit like posting challenges on Instagram, There are literally millions of daily wage workers, homeless and deprived people. More than 1 lakh people are stranded at the UP Delhi border. Who the fuck will look after them if they contract the disease? Who the fuck will care about them? 

These people are at many times the only breadwinners of the family. Can we be so ignorant, that we readily allow entire families of poor to get destroyed? Some  owners of factories, contractors have simply haven't paid these workers and simply turned a blind eye towards these people. 

People like you and me have plenty of surplus money and resources. There are people who literally completely depend on their next month's salary to run their houses. How do you think would they manage?

Government just abruptly closed down the entire nation. What arrangement did it make so that the poor reach their homes along with their familes safely? It is not as simple as booking a cab or renting a car for them. People are literally walking miles and miles to reach home. Why aren't these people being given masks, being scanned or being disinfected? People are being brutally tortured by the police. Don't they deserve spending this dark and difficult time with their familes, in their homes?
Try to imagine the immense fear and desperation and the helplessness of these people.

Everybody is praising the Indian government on how efficiently they brought an early lockdown. They don't realize what the poor are going through, simply because the society doesn't care about them.

"[Serious] Seeking advice from r/India since most other places have foreigners who can not give proper answer Hello,

I am someone who wanted to do research for a living, physics specifically, but because of various circumstances was forced to do a bachelors degree in electronics and communications engineering in India. I had previously been in a markedly Western system and could not cope but was forced to finish the degree anyway. It took me 7 years to finish with reappear papers piling up over and over again and I am now 25 years old with a low undergraduate gpa (6.122/10). I am still interested in research but I don't know where to go now. I was hoping to do research in physics (and I still am) but after some discussions I may have to change things up a bit.

I've discussed a bit about what I've heard from reddit with my parents. As far as things go financially, I am pretty dependent on them. Now from the way the discussion went down last time, I get the feeling that they might be getting impatient what with me taking so long on my bachelor's already and from what they are letting on, I should either get into a program already or get a job soon. No preparation for exams or anything unless it is going to take 2-3 months or less. I don't know if that is enough time even if I were to study night and day. Besides, shouldn't I gain conceptual/research knowledge?

From the options I have gotten from Reddit, it basically boils down to mostly getting an MSc. I'd rather avoid doing it in India mostly because I am fed up with the educational system. People just learn how to parrot the textbook instead of actually becoming skilled in their chosen field but that may not be an option because of what I did. I pretty much just followed the curriculum. No extra curriculars/research experiences. Any practical laboratory work listed in my transcripts is pretty much on paper too. I mean it's not like I haven't handled a soldering rod, some circuitry, CROs and other small stuff but, then again, who hasn't? One redditor mentioned that because of this it may be easier to do MSc in India first, get research experience and attempting post baccalaureate courses to beef up my resume, then going abroad but as mentioned before, there is the issue of what my parents will and will not allow.

The problem comes due to the intervening periods. It doesn't help that my parents despite trying to act progressive are still limited by traditional thinking. I can't exactly blame them what with money being a relatively limited resource in our family and time passing by but that is not exactly helping with my long term plans. Due to this, theoretically, I cannot take the time off to prepare for exams for the universities such as JNU's physics MSc entrance exam or something nor will I be able to work on the post baccalaureate courses since they will take time AND money. Practically, I would probably have to work to find a job and as long as I don't find a job, I would keep preparing for the exams and what not but then I have to juggle that with trying to keep up with the knowledge required for the job that they will obviously test, if not outright rejecting me based on my grades, in some prelim exam and/or the interview. That or get a clerical job but I don't know if even that is possible because of the burgeoning population.

Now my first question to you guys is if some of the following fields might be easier to pursue research in. They may be somewhat related to both my bachelor's field as well as physics and I do have interest in them. I am not asking you guys to advise me about any of them but I am putting this out in case any of you know if it would be easier for me to go into research currently in any of those fields. Anyway, the fields are:

1. Quantum information science (computing, information theory, etc.) - Our field did involve conventional computing and information theory

2. Quantum devices/electronics, though I don't really much like the sound of this. I didn't realize there was a particular distinction between conventional electronics and quantum electronics. To my knowledge, standard electronics are based on our understanding of QM phenomena.

3. Photonics - Study of optical phenomena and derivative technologies such as optical waveguides, splitters, couplers, etc., was also focused on somewhat in my field

4. Photovoltaics/Renewable Energy Research in general - Photovoltaics is probably more the focus here. I put the second part there to emphasize my intention with research in it as well as tangential research interests.

5. Condensed Matter physics. This is more general than electronics so I don't expect it to be easier but just in case...

6. Physics of computers/information - not sure about this since it seems like it could fall into information theory

7. Dynamic systems theory (control theory, chaos theory, quantum chaos, etc.)/Study of Complex Systems - Our branch did have a lot to do with (mathematically) modelling various systems in many different ways, observing the effect of various inputs and feedbacks on the outputs.

My second question to everybody is, how would I accomodate my constraints, financial constraints being of particular note? Basically, I have to get into a program but seeing as that may be very unlikely, I may have to get a job instead. But I don't know if I can get anything other than a sub par clerical job with my degree and grades and I am not sure that would help me further my long term plans. To sum up, I am really confused about the next step to take. Please advise.",Science/Technology

"[Advice] I cannot decide which college I should go to. Please help! I'm from West Bengal and I recently qualified WBJEE. With my rank, I'm getting both Jalpaiguri Government engineering college and Heritage institute of technology, Kolkata. 

But I cannot decide which college I should choose. HITK is situated in Kolkata a metropolitan city, it's a more rushed life with more opportunities in proffesional and social life and my girlfriend lives there. We have been in a committed relationship for 4 years and it's going strong, I do not want to risk that, which will definitely happen if I go to JGEC which is 600km away from Kolkata.

Both the colleges have similar faculties but JGEC is a government college which makes it's placements better, also the govt tag is a big thing.

Truthfully I do not care about the placements as I'm determined to go for GATE and a masters degree. The primary concern about studying in the private college is the fee which is considerably higher than a govt college and putting that pressure on my parents seems morally evil. 

But my relationship is a high priority in my life and I do not want to loose a girl so mature and understanding in a world almost deviod of true feelings. I want to lead a hard-working productive life but also want my relationship to survive. I just can't understand what decision I should take. 

If I choose JGEC and my relationship breaks and I don't have my peace of my mind, it'll be a huge regret but then again giving my parents the financial trouble, it's a freaking chaos in my mind. Can someone please help, please. Advices, personal incidents, every insight is welcome.",AskIndia

"[General] What is your opinion about the IITs? Do you think they're worth it? What should be done to fix the obviously flawed institutions and their admission process? Some of you may have come across one of my previous posts in this subreddit which can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e5sqaz/im_jee_aspirant_is_there_any_chance_i_can_crack/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) if you're looking for the full story. Basic information is that I've been preparing for JEE Mains exam but some problems have hindered my preparation and plan.

While preparing I couldn't ignore how flawed these institutions are, there's barely any research done, barely any breakthroughs in science, lack of innovation and a lot of it can be attributed to how these institutions take in students, the admission process is biased towards upper middle class and the rich, those who can afford the ridiculously expensive coaching institutions, the coaching culture is a demon in its own way and deserves a thread on its own but I'll keep it as straight and simple as I can. The admission process involves how fast you can apply the memorized formula to a specific type of question, it doesn't require you to approach the question in an innovative way which would force you to think about it.

I could go on and on about how the system is flawed, how they should introduce western ways to take in students which both supports extra-curricular activities, overall creativity, communication and sports.

In conclusion, I don't think they're worth 3-4 years of life the students have to sacrifice in order to get these institutions, the pressure and lack of social interaction.",Sports

"[AskIndia] Why do we have so much distrust of Businesses and Markets? Was listening to a talk from Kunal Shah (founder of Freecharge and Cred) and found quite a few insights about the attitude of Indians towards generating wealth through businesses.

A few things really stood out. For example -

1. India has a unique MRP system for products found nowhere else in the world. It gives us the illusion that we are charged fairly for our goods but it works very counter-intuitively against the poor.
Because the rich pay almost the same price as the poor. A richer neighbourhood should have richer prices than in a poorer neighbourhood.
The manufacturer has to price the MRP at a rate higher than he would in a competitive market because he needs to make sure he covers his cost or overruns due to dead or destroyed stock.

2. How we, as Indians, value money over time. We would not pay for quality which saves us time but we will gladly buy sub-quality goods if it saves us money.

3. We question and probe profit percentages of each private company but have no clue about the efficiency of government spending and yet we keep clamouring for more taxes.

4. Pre-1991, we were poor and ridden with Socialist policies which championed the poor and the farmers and we went bankrupt. But after 1991, when we allowed foreign money to come in, we saw a substantial rise in the standard of living and goods.
Yet, we are still calling restrictions on foreign capital in e-commerce and retail which is just perplexing.

5. We think the private companies are out to loot the people of India and we think Adani and Ambani are rich because of Modi but it is, in fact, the lack of competition and implementation of endless rules and licenses that allow Adani and Reliance to operate in any field with almost no competition.


I don't get it. Is this an education thing? Have we been taught capitalism incorrectly? The numbers are so clear yet we are still stuck in denial about having government involvement in the economy. So many people flock to capitalist economies from India yet why do we trust the government so much?

And before anyone says, yes I do think Healthcare, defense, law and order should be under government along with economic incentives for education and research but beyond that, you don't really need government.",Policy/Economy
"So is it PTSD ? So here's a thing , every time I experience agression like someone shouts at me / near me , someone gets aggressive and physical etc I feel really sick inside stomach , my heart beat rises real fast , I get super nervous and anxious , my ears feel warm and blank , forehead and hair feels hot and sweaty , breathing feels difficult , in extreme cases I feel blacked-out . I kinda feel this is PTSD developed due to my altercation with my dad couple of years ago and all my episodes mostly with him leading upto the said altercation , I'm not sure that the said event itself is  a trigger point , but it is one of the things that tend to come to my mind post my episodes of  heightened state of fear / anger  . 
I tried talking to a therapist couple of times before but our interactions were never able to reach any fruitful state . Simply speaking , I believe I have too much to unpack , but when I finally get to talk to them it kinda feels like a lot of the troubling stuff seems irrelevant ,
 Sometimes somewhat borderline inappropriate  to our conversation . 

When someone asks me what's essentially wrong with me , I don't have a definate answer so it makes it incredibly difficult to ask family members for help , they just try their age old method of talking sense into me by asking me stop overthinking as if I have control , it makes it really difficult for me to socialize , fear of a breakdown . 

What do you think I should / can do ? Should i give my parents an ultimatum that they take me to a psychiatrist directly as  I was once referred to one by a psychologist but we just decided to not peruse it . I think they think I'm playing this therapy card every time I want to escape responsibility but they never expressed it outrightly  

I'm kinda free right now , waiting for my degree results , I'm 2 years behind my herd .Also no one in my life seems to be brave enough to confront me about my future , I'm scared of making a decision due to my present degree state , I wander too much so it kinda feels like I can do everything but when I attempt to figure out what to do , reallity hits me hard , so I'm super scared thus in constant denial",AskIndia

"Would your next car be an electric car? If so how much money are you willing to spend and what are your overall thoughts about the EV industry ? Hyundai is all set to release their electric car in India on July 9th which is estimated to be around 25 lacs. Now we all know this is too costly for a middle-class person but there's some good news! 
With major companies such as Suzuki announcing that they would stop production of diesel-powered cars starting next year. Moreover, the percentage of people buying both petrol and diesel cars have reduced dramatically. So basically companies such as Hyundai, fiat, Mahindra, Renault, Suzuki have a huge stockpile of cars unsold. Now with rising fuel prices and adding the maintenance costs, people are choosing not to buy a car and are instead using services such us Uber, ola. The government are also offering incentives and are reducing the tax on electric vehicles. (People can refer to the recent budget and see the tax benefit, interest rates on loan for EV vehicles )

Here are a couple of things I would like to see the government implement for the growth of EV cars.

1-charging stations across the country equipped with fast charging so that people traveling to far away places face no worry. 
2-battery production to be done in India on a major scale so the price of the car comes down.

Lastly, I hope all the major car manufacturers understand that electric cars are the future and start manufacturing some decent electric cars with good range, looks and keep a competitive price. 

So do you think you would buy an electric car in the next few years and what are your basic requirements

"The plight of daily wagers shows how wrong Indian society is. Instead of giving people fair wages, we are now donating to ""feed the wager"" campaigns as if they are some animals needing help. No where in the civilized world can you get a human to do stuff for you, 12 hours a day, for less than Rs. 300.   
The people working as masons, painters, fabrication welders etc. are all paid less than the minimum wage in most cities, despite being quite skilled at their work. Same goes for maids and cooks in most parts of the country. Someone I know hires a full time maid for 20k in Mumbai, with food and lodging included. But many don't get that much, especially in smaller cities and villages. Security guards even in places like Gurgaon and Delhi earn less than 10k a month.   
Growing up, it was common to see and expect a slum in the vicinity of a new apartment complex because that is where the ""bais"" and their ""car-washing"" husbands stay. That has not changed at all, it has worsened now and slums are home to many more professions (including TEACHERS of all people). 

We often hear people say ""life in India is really good because you have a maid, a cook and a driver for daily life"". This is because these folks never got what they deserved. They are exploited and without contracts. 

I find it incredibly insensitive to see campaigns like ""feed a daily wager"" as if they are zoo animals. No one gives a shit about their well being and fair pay when they should. The ""good life"" in India is because the middle class and the rich just want the wagers to survive like animals. Nowhere in the world would this same middle class with their level of income, even if they earn in USD, get so many human services for such cheap rates. 

I believe this is happening to white collar jobs as well. For all the ""no-skills-in-graduates"" bullshit, many graduates even from good colleges almost work for free and have to depend on their parents. 

TLDR: Indians brag about having maids and cooks and cleaners as a quality of life enhancer. Truth is that they can afford them ONLY because they are being exploited. The current campaigns to ""feed the wager"" could have been more sensitive to their plight and focused on creating a formal, contracted workforce of helpers, and unorganized sector employees.",Food

"Moody’s lowers India’s GDP growth forecast to 5.3 per cent in 2020 on coronavirus implications on the economy.  Moody’s Investors Service on Tuesday lowered India’s GDP growth forecast for 2020 calendar year to 5.3 per cent, on coronavirus implications on the economy.  

 February projected a 5.4 per cent real GDP growth for India in 2020. This too was a downgrade from 6.6 per cent earlier forecast. 

 “A number of governments and central banks have announced countervailing measures, including fiscal stimulus packages, policy rate cuts and regulatory forbearance; however, the effectiveness of policy easing will be blunted by measures to contain the outbreak, and policy space is constrained for some sovereigns,” 

 Moody’s said oil price shock adds to growth and fiscal pressures for exposed sovereigns. “A period of lower oil prices will further weigh on the economic and fiscal fundamentals of oil exporters, while mitigating the trade shock for importers.”

It may sound cringe but if you tell me to act happy or something, It would be damn difficult for me to even sport a smile ..being introvert is also a factor.

"[Rant] Rotten Indian System - Marriage Certificate cost me 6 times the official price, with zilch convenience Apologies, but this is a RANT post and I need to vent out my experience of dealing with the govt somewhere. 

&amp;#x200B;

I went to my family tout (yes, guilty here!) thinking it would be

1. done seamlessly
2. cost me 3x at best

&amp;#x200B;

But what I was not aware of is that despite paying 6x of what it would have cost me had I gone through the legit route, I got zero convenience. I was made to visit the office THRICE! The guy behind the counter was meaning to make more trouble for me by saying the only passport would be admissible as address proof, but then I relented and forced him to either accept my Voter ID for address proof OR state to me in writing with his name that the ID is not acceptable. He then realized it is not his day to mess with me further and let it go.

The tout as well was incompetent - didn't know of most intricacies or was unwilling to make it any easier for us. And his service charge itself was 1.5k. I had to take 2 half days from work and visit the place THRICE, because sometimes either some new affidavit has to be made or even better, Digital India's server connectivity got lost! #FML!

So, what should have cost me 500 rupees at best, cost me over 3k. And took me a span of 2 days and several hours waiting in the line in this heat JUST to get my marriage certificate. As an honest tax paying citizen, I am not just disgruntled, I am sad what this country has become.

&amp;#x200B;

For me, India lost today - Sometimes, I wonder if we would have been in a better place under British rule.

\[End of RANT\] 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR - Went to do a govt job done, took me 6x the legit price and 2 days without even buying me any convenience.

EDIT - I am aware I was at fault for not having explored the online option myself. I accept that. But regardless, the experience left much to be desired and it could certainly have been less painful.",Non-Political

"Can we appreciate the fact that Aamir khan has covered movies on all aspects of life. Education, Friendship, Patriotism, Mental Issues, Terrorism, Sports, Religion. in Bollywood where 90% of the movies are BS (yes we have some sensible filmmakers like kashyap etc) aamir khan has more or less been a fresh air.

Yes the intolerance stuff and some of his other initiatives, people are polarized but you have to accept he has setup a quality benchmark in bollywood in main stream movies.

"[non-political]Married redditors of r/india, how do you share your financial responsibilities with your spouse? So my friend and her husband were planning a holiday to a 'foreign' land. But, unfortunately a couple of emergencies later the husband was pressed for time and couldn't complete the booking and now they both are sitting at home (they had applied for leave a month back). Now my friend is pretty smart, independent and had a bit of time on her hands. But she didn't do the bookings simply because the trip was to be financed by him and she couldn't afford it on her own salary. Now, the thing is they desperately wanted to make this trip, but couldn't and I fail to understand why she couldn't make the bookings herself and got me thinking - do all couples keep their finances apart? I ask because there are a couple of other red flags in their relationship like he doesn't let her travel anywhere alone or mingle with people freely; especially his friends.   ",Non-Political

"Either India's property developers are insane or I am. I'm at the age where buying a house is the next thing on my agenda. I've been looking at listings on property websites a lot lately. So consequently, most of the ads I see online on Instagram, Facebook and even Reddit are for properties.

Nothing about these properties or their pricing makes any sense to me whatsoever.

Take a new development by Godrej in Delhi - Godrej South Estates. They've been spamming the shit out of me with their ads. The prices start at ""only"" 2.6cr for. 2 bedroom. For a 4 bedroom apartment, rates start at 6.5-7cr.

They're pushing it as some sort of ultra luxury destination...except its in Okhla, which is an industrial area. I used to have my office in the area and its literally one of the shittiest areas in the entire city. There is a literal trash mountain right next to the development

Not that development has even started yet. They're advertising $1M apartments built near trash heaps witg delivery scheduled around Modi's next term.

The situation in Gurgaon seems to be even more insane. There are apartment complexes built in the middle of nowhere with not a single street light for miles being advertised for crores.

Meanwhile if you wanted an apartment in the already established, well settled areas in DLF Phase 3, you can get them for half the price

Back in my hometown of Jaipur, apartments rates are equally out of whack. You can pay 1cr for an apartment in Vaishali Nagar...or you can buy a piece of land 100 meters away from the apartment and built a little mansion of your own for less than 1cr

My brain is not really able to compute any of this. 5cr apartments that are not even 50% ready built in the middle of nowhere? Who is buying them? More importantly, why are they buying them?

At this point, I feel that I will keep renting all my life. Not because I can't afford a house, but because nothing about the Indian property market seems rational to me. I make very substantial money but I refuse to participate in this utter irrationality

"We really need to talk about Flairs. Hello /r/india  
  
Here are some clarifications on submission flairs, since we see a lot of mis-flaired posts from time to time.  
  
**[P] - Political**  
  
These are for political posts only. If a post involved any politician, political party or anything primarily related to politics, then it must be flaired as political  
  
**[NP] - Non-political**  
  
These are for discussions where you are confident there is no politics involved. You cannot flair a post that is primarily or tangentially related to politics with an NP tag.  
 
This is important because quite a few people use the filters we have on the sidebar to filter out political (or non-political) posts, and misflairing one as the other may irritate these users.  
  
**[R] - Reddiquette**  
  
When this flair is selected, Reddit's Reddiquette guidelines are enforced in the thread, along with certain other restrictions so as to have a slightly higher quality discussion.    
  
Jokes, puns and low effort comments will be removed in such threads.
  
This can be used for both political and non-political topics.  
  
**[ASK] - AskIndia**  
  
These are flairs for self-posts where the OP wants to ask the community a question. You cannot use this flair for link posts (because that makes no sense unless ToI or HT wants to ask /r/india a question).  
  
If the question is political in nature, then the thread must be flaired with P or R, not with AskIndia. This is to prevent filters from being breached.  
  
**Science & Technology** 

This flair is for topics with an explicit, mostly non-political science & technology bent to it. If it tangentially involves politics, it is fine to use this flair in place of [P].   
 
If Modi makes a comment about the ISRO, then it is a P thread.  
If the ISRO conducts some research that points to where state governments can improve with irrigation, and a politician comments on that, then it can be flaired with Science & Technology assuming the primary focus of the story isn't the politician's comment.  

**Policy & Economy**
  
These flairs work similarly. The main topic of the subject matter should be about policy or economy. The instant the focus shifts to politics, political parties, politicians, etc. the flair must be [P].  

**Business & Finance**  

These flairs are for articles, or self-post submissions with a non-political, business bent to them. If you want to know where to invest or if Ola Cabs decides to go public, then this is the flair for you.  
  
**Entertainment** 

Entertainment flair is exclusively for pop-culture links, submissions, and discussions. Examples under this flair include movie trailers, movie clips, comics, YouTube joke sketches and things along those lines.  
  
This flair cannot be used for some politician saying something absurd, funny or ridiculous. That constitutes an editorialization of the title on the part of the OP - since the OP insinuates that the subject matter is funny with the title (instead of letting the reader make up their mind).   
 
**Sports and Food** 

Sports & Food flairs are very self-explanatory  

**AMA**
  
AMA flairs are given to OPs who verify their identity with the mod team. In case they choose not to verify, they will get an **Unverified** flair.  
  
**In-Depth**

This flair must be used carefully.This flair *only* used when you need an In-depth discussion about the topic. Top comments must have a proper explanation/discussion about the top. Top comments must fulfil the word limit else the comment **will** get deleted by all mighty automod.

---  
PS - In the event of confusion, just go for Reddiquette.
  
Recommendations for new flairs may be made below.  ",AskIndia

"Spicy food causing upper back pain? Myth or reality? I'm a traveller who arrived in India just over a week ago. Since then, I only had Indian food, mostly street food and cheap restaurants. I'm already getting used to the spiciness unlike at the beginning.

Two days ago I started having acute upper back pain between my shoulder blades. Pain when turning neck, especially downwards. Feeling of being ""stuck"". I'm personally thinking I got a bad knot from sleeping in a weird position + poor posture.

Now, everybody has different unprofessional diagnosis and advice for that kinda thing; muscle sprain, pulled, knot. The most original I've heard is that all the spices somehow build up gas that can get stuck in the back; should go away over a few days or with a muscle relaxant. Apparently that would be a pretty common phenomenon in India, including amongst Indians themselves. To me that sounds pretty pseudoscience, can't any source about it anyway. But I'm curious what Indians have to say about it. Is this really a common saying?",Food

"Question for Indians: would you say that the Indian work ethic is similar to the Japanese, where ""appearing to work"" is more important than productivity level? In Japanese salaryman culture, it's common for workers to spend work hours being unproductive, or even having nothing to do until their boss gives them work. The culture surrounding work emphasizes *being at work* and *appearing to work*, but actual level of productivity is less important. It's more important that your butt is in the chair for 10 hours a day than that you're productive. This is why despite the long hours, [Japan has a very low level of productivity](https://www.tokyoreview.net/2018/07/japan-productivity-overwork/):

&gt;The problem is that for Japan, productivity isn’t the point. The professional culture is input-based (full schedules of meetings, onerous paperwork and menial tasks, and similar) rather than output-based, where long hours and late nights are a less a means to accomplish tasks and more of a means of value-signaling, demonstrating devotion to the organization and commitment to the team members. That isn’t unique to Japan – any visitor to Washington, DC will notice people boasting of their lifespan-shortening work regimens – but what’s unique to Japan is prioritizing the effort made over concrete results. There are two reasons why the problem is so pernicious.

I was wondering if this work culture would also apply to India. I know very little about Indian work culture. Does it similarly emphasize appearance and the ""ritual"" of work, over raw productivity?",AskIndia

"I have never in my life been less proud to be Indian... I live in the U.S because I was born and raised there, and both my parents are from Telanagana / Andhra Pradesh. I have however, lived in India for 6 years in Hyderabad. The whole time, I was and always will be proud of my Indian heritage and our amazing cultures all across the country. 

However, with the absolute BULLSHIT that the government is doing in Kashmir, I am terribly disappointed and I truly believe this is the worst thing India has ever done. But do you know what's even worse? Our fellow Indians are being BLINDLY nationalistic as always, ready to support the government from phantom threats. There should be protests happening in all the big cities, for what the Indian government is doing right now is an atrocity. People are getting shot on the street with anti-protesting shotguns. I guarantee that if this was happening in some other country, all of us would be quick to jump on the criticism bandwagon and compare them to North Korea. But I will tell you without any doubt that the actions India is taking against Kashmir is unwarranted and is comparable to the likes of North Korea of China, who you all so dearly detest. Say whatever you want, that I'm a snobby NRI who lives comfortable life in the U.S, or that I don't know any struggles in life. Who TF cares??? This isn't about me. This is about the greater good of our beautiful country. Why is everyone silent? This is absolutely unacceptable!

How can we get this to some news outlet?Non-Political I'm posting this the third time because /r/india doesn't allow quora links. You can find the source by copy pasting some text from below and googling.

> I am going to write the truth about this unfair evaluation..there are few things u must know...
> 
> 1. GGSIPU pays Rs. 25 per answer book ....in one bundle there are 30 answer books so it makes Rs750/-  for evaluating one bundle....GGSIPU norms say that a evaluator must take 3 hours to evaluate one bundle....so in a day a evaluator can evaluate a maximum of two bundles.....which makes a total earning of Rs.1500/- per day + a conveance of Rs.600/- per day making the total amount = Rs. 2100/-.
> Now what actually happens is in the university there are two evaluation centres one for first and third year and the other for second and final year.....now actually what happens is....an evaluator reaches centre A at 9:30 am and get a bundle issued which he/she checks in one hour but do not deposit it as the university employees will not take it back before three hours...so they leave that bundle there and rush too the B centre and get another bundle issued there at 11:00  they check it by 12:00 now they rush back to centre A to return their previous bundle and get a new bundle issued there....the same process is repeated and an evaluator ends up in checking two bundles each at both evaluation centres thus earning Rs. 4200/- a day instead of Rs. 2100/-  a day..
> now just imagine the answer book u wrote in 3 hours is evaluated in less then 2 minutes.....coz the evaluator has to right the marks on front sheet and do the total and also fill an additional evaluation sheet with marks....and all this he does in a maximum of 1 and a half hour for 30 answer books. This is done by around 20 % evaluators who comes for evaluation.
> 
> 2. To be an evaluator the university ask every evaluator to fill a form which contains a maximum of four subject that the evaluator has taught in the current semester.....this form need to be signed by the hod and the head of the institution also......now the beauty is very few teachers teaches more then two subject in college but in these forms most of the evaluators fill four subjects....now imagine four subject for centre A and four subject for centre B which mean they know 8 subjects and thus makes them elligible to check copies of 8 different subjects...coz if one subject answer books are over then they can get the next subject issued....
> 
> 3. Approx. 80 % of the evaluators do not prepare a solution nor do they know the solution.....they are just giving average marks.....that is the reason why the students writing anything get marks and often pass the exams.
> 
> 4. Most of the senior and sincere teachers do not go for evaluation....the people doing evaluation are primarily those who are on consolidated salary getting anything between Rs.20,000/ to Rs. 30,000/- as salary from there parent college....so they find it as an opportunity to earn some extra money.....just imagine that there are evaluators who earn around Rs. 50,000/ or even more during evaluation......this should explain most of the reasons....
> 
> 5. The fact is very few evaluators actually evaluate the answer books....90% of evaluation is done with just the monitary benefits associated with it....so until the university takes some serious counter measures .....this will continue to happen.....
> 
> I am sorry for those who feel offended by my answer....but am ready to face any debate who could challenge my answer.....

I ask her about her day, make her laugh, help her out but all this seems to have put in the friend zone.

"Hindus are not in danger. Economy and democracy are in danger. Hindu khatre mein nahi hai. Economy aur democracy khatre mein hai.

It's is often said by sanghis who claim that 'Hindu khatre mein hain' and that india will become Muslim majority by 2050, however the reality is that even if Hindus do not have any children and if the Muslim population grows at a rate of 2% per year, the Muslim population will only be about 360 million(36 crore) and for the Muslim population to even reach the current level of hindu population it will take about 80 years growing at a constant rate of 2%.

This 2% isn't even their actual growth rate, it's even lesser.

In 1951 census, the population of India was 360.9 million(36.09 crore) out of which 303.6 million(30.36) was Hindu and Muslim was 35.4 million(3.54 crore), in 2011 census, the population of India was 1.21 billion(121 crore)  of which hindu population was about 965.6 million(96.56 crore) and Muslim population was about 171.8 million(17.18 crore).

So this means, from 1951 to 2011 census, the contribution of population growth of Hindus is about 78% and Muslims is about 16%. So no, india is not going to be Muslim majority and taken over in 2050 or something along those lines, it is just fear mongering by sanghis.

Also since india became more developed compared to 1951, the fertility rate has come down across ALL religions. More developed areas have lower fertility rates in general.

Right now, democracy and economy are in danger.

Our GDP has been the lowest at 4.5% since the past 6 years. You can't have $5 trillion economy in 2024, if the economy is slowing down like this, we need a double digit growth to accomplish, yet since every quarter, the economic growth is sliding down.

Several sectors of the economy are experiencing negative growth. This [article](https://thewire.in/economy/facing-the-reality-how-can-modi-reverse-the-current-economic-slowdown) explains the problems pretty well and also talks about solutions.

As we also know democracy is also under threat, look what's happening in UP, Delhi and many other places, dissent is being shutdown. Many protesters are getting beaten, getting shot, some of them are getting killed. Dissent is also stopped by bringing internet shutdowns. India accounts for 67% of all internet shut downs, that happen across the world, the internet shutdowns in kashmir has been longer than 145 days, longest ever in a democracy. India has the most number of internet shutdowns in the world by far. India's rank in freedom of press index is dropping.

The opposition to CAA is being called 'anti-nationals' as usual. The CAA-NPR-NRC is deadly combo, it will have their way for a Hindu rastra and therefore it would be the end of a secular democracy. it will strip millions of Muslim of their citizenship. The financial cost of this will be insane.

The NRC in Assam costed about Rs. 1,220 crores which has a population of 30.6 million(3.06 crore) which is about 2.2% of india's population. Out of that, 1.9 million(19 lakh) were could'nt prove their citizenship. The cost of this would be Rs. 399 per person.

If we apply this to whole nation, whose population is 1.37 Billion(137 crore), it would be about Rs. 55,000 crore. Building one detension centre in Assam, which could detain about 3,000 people costed about Rs. 45 crore.

Detaining even 50 million(5 crore) people, this would cost about Rs. 7.5 lakh crore. For comparison total budgetary expenditure for health and education was Rs. 8.4 lakh crore in 2018-19. This whole CAA-NPR-NRC is not only extremely discriminatory but also financially terrible.",CAA-NRC-NPR

"A modest proposal to end all rapes in the country In light of the genius of the Government in handling illegal immigration through NPR, NRC and CAA, I propose the following to end the rape crisis in India once and for all.

* In the upcoming census, ask people the names of all of their sexual relations and whether it was consensual or not. It is a self declaration only.

* We will analyze and use the data to publish the list of suspected rapists. If anyone feels that a rapist is missing in the list, you can anonymously get them added.

* The police will thereafter arrest all suspected rapists and due process will be followed in the court of law. It is upto the rapist to prove otherwise.

* The Government understands that women may have problems due to them being victims of rapes more often. Hence special fast track courts would be set up to provide them justice. Here we will assume their innocence unless proven otherwise.

* Some anti-women groups would call the above as specifically calling all men rapists. It is not. It is just providing quick access to justice to women.

* No non rapist would be affected by the process.",CAA-NRC-NPR

"How should I feel? How should I feel that I'm privileged? I'm 25, earning 60k, and it's not that I'm dumb or something but sometimes I feel how to feel. My dad's a government officer, mid-fifties, earns more than a lac. He's the most hard working and disciplined person I have ever seen. He's in the government since his early twenties. He's just 3 years away from retirement. He loves reading and love making contacts. My mom's a housewife(mid-forties or late forties, lol I don't know her date of birth), she's sweet, lovely, caring and love making people happy. My sibling is the best. He's earning okay. My parents have raised me well. I'm glad I grew up in the nineties, so I developed a lot of interest in sports and played a lot of them at competitive levels. I had a profound interest in video games and computers. My dad bought a one in the early 2000s I guess, with Windows 95 on it. He used it for typing, there was something FoxPro thing I don't exactly remember he used to do. Then most of my 2000s went playing with friends, games, school, etc. It was real fun, to be honest. I cherish those memories, a lot. College was not so good, but okay kinda. I realized a hell lot in college, not the studies haha but a lot about me. I'm not on Facebook and Instagram, quit them already. In the past year, I've developed a rigorous thinking about work and how not to throw away your life. It's really turning good for me. I follow Angel co-founder Naval and like him a lot. He's a good man. All in all, I have my interests or niche that I follow. It's good to not be mainstream sometimes. I don't have a goal. The only thing I know is to work hard, improve my skills and learn continuously. I joke at people who settle down and say learning stops when you get old. I call bullshit. 

But I don't know how should I feel? Being in a country with people who are deprived of such things. Should I feel guilty or thankful? I would think, if I was born in a poor family, I would've been living a mediocre life, with struggling to survive. I think when I reach 30, I will be financially independent. Only dependencies I want are my parents and sibling. No external sources like marriage or some other shit.  They raised me right, now it will be my turn to be with them at old age.

"Citizenship Amendment Act(CAB/CAA), National Registry of Indian Citizens(NRC/NRIC) - the past, present and a possible future The internet rabbit hole took me to various places when I was curious to know *how* India currently ascertains 'citizenship' and whether this nationalised version of NRC,Assam is going to be one of those confusing, complex (a possibly futile?) plan by the Government to undertake a massive exercise like GST, curbing fake notes etc., across India. **Based on the sequence of events from 2000 till now, I have summarised the events that seems to have lead to where we are today and what we may have to face in the near future due to the Pandora box labeled ""citizenship"" that India has opened currently.**

#PAST
*****
The Kargil War happened on 1999. Post the war(and India's victory),

>The Kargil Review Committee (KRC) was set up by the Government of India on 29 July 1999 three days after the Kargil War came to an end. The committee was set up ""to examine the sequence of events and make recommendations for the future,"" as mentioned in the epilogue of the final report and the ""Terms of Reference"" laid down in the executive summary.
> 
> Over a hundred senior military, civil service and intelligence officials, politicians, including former prime ministers, diplomats and journalists were interviewed by the high-powered committee over a period of five months. The report was completed on 15 December 1999 and tabled in the Parliament of India on 23 February 2000.Certain parts of the final KRC report, such as the findings, have remained confidential till date.

>Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kargil_Review_Committee

Another source suggests :
> A comprehensive systemic overhaul of the country's security and intelligence apparatus in keeping with the technological revolution and the need for integrated management structures was unfolded by the Group of Ministers (GOM) in a report submitted by them to PM on February 26, 2001. The GOM had been set up in April 2000 to review the national security system in its entirety and in particular to consider the recommendations of the Kargil Review Committee and formulate specific proposals for implementation. The GOM under the Chairmanship of Shri L.K. Advani also included the Defence Minister, External Affairs Minister and Finance Minister.

>Source:  http://pibarchive.nic.in/archive/releases98/lyr2001/rmay2001/23052001/r2305200110.html

One among a huge list of things discussed in **GOM report of 2001** is ""Border Management"" (there are some redacted bits shown as dotted line further below). The initial sections give the rationale behind the importance of ""Border Management"":

> **Chapter V:BORDER MANAGEMENT**
> 
> India has 14,880 kms of land border running through 92 districts in 17 States and a coastline of 5,422 kms touching 12 States and Union Territories (UTs). India also has a total of 1197 islands accounting for 2094 kms of additional coastline. There are 51 Bangladeshi enclaves (area involved 7,110.02 acres) in India and 111 Indian enclaves (area involved 17,158.13 acres) in Bangladesh. In fact, barring Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Delhi and Haryana, all other States in the country have one or more international borders or a coastline and can be regarded as frontline States from the point of view of border management.

the report goes on to say...
> Illegal migration from across our borders has continued unabated for over five decades. We have yet to fully wake up to the implications of the unchecked immigration for the national security. Today, we have about 15 million Bangladeshis, 2.2 million Nepalese, 70,000 Sri Lankan Tamils and about one lakh Tibetan migrants living in India. Demographic changes have been brought about in the border belts of West Bengal, several districts in Bihar, Assam, Tripura and Meghalaya as a result of large-scale illegal migration. Even States like Delhi, Maharashtra and Rajasthan have been affected. Such large-scale migration has obvious social, economic, political and security implications. There is an all-round failure in India to come to grips with the problem of illegal immigration. 

>**Unfortunately, action on this subject invariably assumes communal over-tones with political parties taking positions to suit the interest of their vote banks.** The massive illegal immigration poses a grave danger to our security, social harmony and economic well being.
 
In the recommendations under this ""Border Management"", the report says:

> **ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION**
> 
> **Illegal migration has assumed serious proportions. There should be compulsory registration of citizens and non-citizens living in India. This will facilitate preparation of a national register of citizens. All citizens should be given a Multi-Purpose National Identity Card (MPNIC)** and non-citizens should be issued identity cards of a different colour and design. This should be introduced initially in the border districts or may be in a 20 Kms border belt and extended to the hinterland progressively. The Central Government should meet the full cost of the identity card scheme. Many people from the neighbouring countries [……………………..]* are tempted to cross over to India in search of better job opportunities. In order to prevent illegal migration in future, a 'Work Permit for Foreigners' scheme may be introduced, [……………………………………………….].* 

>A proposal for introduction of multi-purpose identity cards to all citizens and compulsory registration of nationals and non-nationals in the country is already under the consideration of the Central Government.

There is a mention of this ""Multi-purpose National Identity Card"" in the PIB archive from 2001 - apparently the Govt was supposed to start implementation of this waay back in 2001: http://pibarchive.nic.in/archive/ArchiveSecondPhase/HOME%20AFFAIR/2001-JAN-JUNE-HOME-AFFAIRS/PDF/HOM-2001-03-20_047.pdf

The recommendations on ""border management"" goes on as follows:

> For effective action against the illegal migrants, Residence Records of villages in the border districts should be prepared and regularly updated. This will allow easy identification and detection of illegal immigrants, until such time as the scheme of registration of all nationals and non-nationals is introduced.
> 
> **Indian Census primary data can easily help in the detection of illegal immigrants**. This information can be a useful tool in establishing the status of illegal migrants. However, since census primary data is confidential in nature, this matter needs to be further discussed with the Registrar General of India and the Ministry of Law.

A further section titled ""Citizenship, Passport, Immigration and Refugee Law"" under recommendations states:

> Children born to illegal immigrants living in India are entitled to claim Indian citizenship by virtue of their birth on Indian soil. **Therefore, in principle, Indian Citizenship Act should be amended prohibiting acquisition of citizenship rights by the children of illegal migrants born in India before 1 August 1987**. This would also meet the stipulations of the Assam Accord. However, as per the advice of the Ministry of Law, the provision can only be introduced with prospective effect. 
> 
> The MHA should take necessary action.
> 
> **As soon as the situation becomes more *propitious* for enacting a law in this regard, a law, for compulsory registration of all Indian national and non-nationals staying in India, should be enacted. This would help in preparing the National Register of Indian Citizens.**

And there you have the first mention of the NRIC - almost 20 years in the making. Looking at the Govt's actions recently with amendment act, the ""propitious"" time seems to be now in 2019. The actual digitized copy of the GOM report of 2001 is nowhere to be found in our Indian Gov websites but there is a version of it in one website: https://www.vifindia.org/sites/default/files/GoM%20Report%20on%20National%20Security.pdf

As a result of this report being submitted and being accepted by the Govt at that time(2001), a flurry of changes happened thereafter. One of which is enactment of ""The Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003"". This actually details the process and framework by which to build the NRIC (National Register of Indian Citizens as http://www.censusindia.gov.in/ states it) and eventually enforce the reality of a ""Multi-purpose National Identity Card"". We should have had the initial ground work for something akin Aadhar way back in 2003 but it never happened. (Read it in full here: http://censusindia.gov.in/2011-Act&Rules/notifications/citizenship_rules2003.pdf)

This framework for gathering information, verifying, issuing citizenship remained as is without much progress till the November 2008 Mumbai attacks. After that, the government was quick to plan and deploy the exercise to create the National Population Register (NPR) for all residents, a precursor to the NRIC. The NPR has been created and digitised (check out http://censusindia.gov.in/2011-Common/IntroductionToNpr.html and https://npr-rgi.nic.in). The Govt then amended the Citizenship Rules,2003 with a Citizenship (amendment) Bill of 2009 (and few amendments happened in later years as well) to initiate the pilot NRC program in Assam.

*****
#PRESENT
*****
We can infer that, together, the Citizenship Rules,2003 and The Citizenship Act, 1955 have been amended multiple times over the years to support the eventual creation of a nationalized NRC(aka NRIC) with Assam being the pilot. The most recent one being tabled in 2016 - the infamous CAB - **Citizenship \(Amendment\) Bill** 2016. As mentioned earlier, we will not go into the details of what the CAB means to the overall 'citizenship' debate and what issues people in north eastern region(specifically Assam) are facing due to NRC and CAB.

The bill is an ""Act"" now. Hence the media outlets have started referring to this as CAA,2019 - Citizenship \(Amendment\) Act of 2019.

> The Bill was introduced in Lok Sabha on 19 July 2016 as the Citizenship \(Amendment\) Bill, 2016. It was referred to the Joint Parliamentary Committee on 12 August 2016. The Committee submitted its report on 7 January 2019.
> 
> Subsequently, the Union Cabinet cleared the Citizenship \(Amendment\) Bill, 2019, on 4 December 2019 for introduction in the parliament. The Bill was introduced in 17th Lok Sabha by the Minister of Home Affairs Amit Shah on 9 December 2019 and was passed on 10 December 2019, with 311 MPs voting in favour and 80 against the Bill.
> 
> The bill was subsequently passed by the Rajya Sabha on 11 December 2019 with 125 votes in favour and 105 votes against it. Those voted in favour included BJP allies such as Janata Dal \(United\), AIADMK, Biju Janata Dal, TDP and YSR-Congress, apart from BJP.
> 
> After receiving assent from the President of India on 12 December 2019, the bill assumed the status of an act. The act will come into force on a date chosen by the Government of India, and will be notified as such.

#FUTURE
*****
Salt: It is obvious that this section will be based on pure hunch/informed opinion...

There *seems* to have been very extensive work done in early 2000s after Kargil war, to increase India's resistance and resilience to such events in the future. To a large part, that(Kargil committee report and the GOM report 2001 on the back of Kargil report) *seems* to be one of the most influential(you can see it mentioned in many annual reports the Home ministry/Defense ministry publishes: https://mha.gov.in/documents/annual-reports) and thorough review of national security - at least the one publicly available. So it is *expected* that (unless a review happens in that scale again) the Govt will follow the process/methods/framework suggested in The Citizenship Rules,2003 and would eventually try to create a baseline NRIC from Census data(as suggested in the GOM recommendations 2001) - *possibly* from up coming Census in 2021.

After so many amendments over the years, The Citizenship Act, 1955 and The Citizenship Rules, 2003 as they stand currently have specific rules to infer citizenship in the ""Assam"" context, but has a very generic rules if it were to be extended to entire India. So there *could* be further amendments tabled so that it is tailored for the various regions across India that share international borders and are bound to have issues in 'identification of a citizen' due to that particular territories regional history(take Tamil Nadu, the Eelam issue and SriLanka for example...)

Steps *may* be taken to ensure the NPR(National Population Register) data is made more reliable and robust. The data from which *may* be used to baseline NRIC(National Register of Indian Citizens) - ground work for this *seems* to have already started based on Govt's actions. Aadhar *may* be re-purposed to become the actual Multi-purpose National Identity Card that the 2001 GOM report initially suggested. Given most countries around the world are moving towards a ""surveillance state"", this move of formalizing 'citizenship' and digitizing that data will give the Govt strong base for full fledged surveillance power. 

India doesn't have robust personal information protections in this digital age(compared to GDPR rules governing PII data in EU for example). So there is no telling how census data(personal in nature) may be used in the future. Is this a good or a bad future we are heading towards? How do they intend to use it? will they abuse it? will this NRIC plan even get fulfilled and a true national ID issued to citizens? - Time will tell

"What is the Future of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in INDIA?  

A news report published in October in The Economic Times said, “Start-ups witness 108% growth in funding in India in 2018.” The news report further mentioned that Artificial Intelligence was among those domains which witnessed the fastest adoption among industry sectors. **Currently, there are about 400 start-ups working on AI and machine learning domains. About $150 million dollars is invested in India’s AI sector by private players alone and the number has been growing since 2016**. Though there has been growth, India lags far behind countries like the US and China in terms of investment. With a copious pool of STEM talent and with a growing population of youngsters, India will be banking on AI for its economic growth and improvement in the quality of life of its citizens.

There are several start-ups that are based in cities such as Bengaluru, New Delhi, Mumbai and Hyderabad which work on artificial intelligence principles to serve consumers better. Their product range varies from multi-lingual chatbots to online shopping assistance and automated consumer data analysis

* **THE ROAD AHEAD**

The National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence which was put together by the government of India through NITI Aayog sets the roadmap on how to develop AI in the country. The report points out how AI will help the country grow, what are the strengths and what are the challenges on the way. The government has identified a few areas where it thinks AI will play a crucial role as far as India is concerned

 

Capital and qualified manpower are the two main pillars that are required for the establishment and growth of any sector. India is home to a large talent pool of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math graduates. Companies such as Google, Intel and Microsoft have been offering short term training programs to computer program developers which help them upskill in the area of AI programming. On the other hand AICTE, the government body which governs and regulates professional education in India, recently added AI, IoT, Machine Learning and few other subjects as mandatory subjects in its curriculum of B.Tech programs. Changes in curriculum and content are further expected in the days to come.

Investment towards AI from private players has been increasing in India ($44 million in 2016 to $77 million in 2017). The start-ups have been working towards developing various AI-based products and services. With conglomerates having a lion’s share in India’s market, there is huge scope for AI-based enterprise solutions in the country. The increasing demand for products and services can attract more investment towards R&amp;D in AI sector

"Sardar and Legacy [Spiritual Translation of Two Marathi Articles] The credit for integrating almost all princely states, barring three, before 15 August 1947 undoubtedly goes to Sardar Patel. But he was of tired body and mind post-independence and post-Gandhi assassination.

It's one thing to like historic fables and another to consider them history. There are often efforts to sell these fables as history. But it's time to look for true history. Currently certain fables are sold as history. Some of them are: Sardar Patel was Hindutvavadi and subsequently anti-Muslim, if he was leading the country instead of Nehru then all of our problems (i.e. Pakistan and Jammu-Kashmir) would've been solved already. Due to wishes of masses, these misunderstandings are considered history. There's effort to sell these fables as history.

First let's tackle most lethel delusion. That is had Mahatma Gandhi not put his weight behind Pandit Nehru, then Sardar Patel would've been our first Prime Minister. A most liked fable in halls of Whatsapp university. Reality however, begs to differ. Pandit Nehru wasn't chosen as Prime Minister at the last minute. It had been going under consideration since 1929. At that time Purna Swaraj (Declaration of Independence of India) under consideration which was officially announced on 26 January 1930. It's leadership came easily under Nehru because he was 2nd most popular leader of Indian National Congress after Gandhi. Then there was a challenge of elections as per Government of India Act 1935. For that, there was no other option than to handover the party presidentship to Nehru. The popularity necessary to win the elections was with Gandhi and Nehru. Sardar Patel was main fundraiser and chairman of Congress' Central Parliamentary Board at that time. However it meant Nehru had bigger responsibility since as a President, he was the face of the party. That is the reason why in 1942 Gandhi declared him as successor. The whole party stood with him and so strong was the resolve that in 1946 - a year before independence - Maulana Abul Kalam Azad resigned presidentship for Nehru.


It's interesting to check the delusions of people who claim Sardar should've been the Prime Minister. After his release from prison in 1945, he was not in good health. He was struggling with diabetes and blood-pressure and his mind was gloomy because of family issues. He had severe heart attack on 4 March 1948, barely a month after Gandhi assassination. Even doctors had given up hopes. Sardar survived but it took a toll on his health. He had said that next news won't be of my sickness but of my death. He died in December 1950. He didn't live to see first general election in India. Nehru was 15 years younger to him. Sardar belonged to generation of Gandhi and Jinnah and three of them died shortly after independence. Sardar Patel's own words are enough to remove any doubt about his desire for Prime Ministership. ""Desire demands youth and health. We have none."" He even conceded that the crowd at Bombay rally had 'come for Jawahar, not for me'.

This should tell us how unrealistic it is to claim Sardar for PM.


Now let us talk about partition. Sardar Patel was one of the first people to agree to partition proposal by Mountbatten. Nehru accepted it later. Maulana Abul Kalam Azad on the other hand, staunchly opposed partition till the end. He was of the opinion that India shouldn't be divided. He himself had written it in his 'India Wins Freedom'. It might be politically incorrect to speak highly of Azad in current political climate. But it is documented history. Patel was first one to accept the truth that it isn't right to make Hindus suffer for dream of Undivided India. Nehru and Gandhi followed him to accept the bitter reality. So all three of them are equally 'responsible' for partition. It is  politically convenient to blame partition on Gandhi and Nehru. But it isn't reality. 

Finally, let's talk about his love for Hindutva. He had none as documented by many historians and journalists such as Narhar Kurundkar, Govindrao Talvalkar, Ramchandra Guha, Rafiq Zakaria, even American Vincent Sheean. He had major role in giving religious roles to Indian Muslims. Minority Institues also have special rights thanks to Patel. He never opposed leadership of Khan Abdul Gafar Khan in Northwest region, nor did he oppose Shaikh Abdulla in Kashmir. Not just that, but he never felt to limit rights of Indian Muslims after creation of Pakistan. It is also history that he had admonished Uttar Pradesh's then Chief Minister  Govind Vallabh Pant after idols of Rama were placed in Babri Masjid in 1949. He was of the opinion of resolving the matter through talks. There's also no example of Patel giving different treatment to Hindu and Muslim rulers of Princely states. Hindu Maharaja of Travancore intended to stay independent. So there's no reason to claim that Patel's politics was motivated by religion.  Infact, his outlook towards RSS changed after Gandhi Assassination. Even though the ties between RSS and Gandhi Assassinations were never proved, he was of the opinion to ban it along with Hindu Mahasabha. 

----

A reader called me to accuse that ""your favourite JRD had said, if Sardar Patel had become the Prime Minister, India would have followed a different path and we could have been in a better economy than we have today"". I spoke with him and by the end of the call he had change of heart. Why? Let's see.

History tells us that Gandhi's economic policies were opposed by Nehru and Patel and two of them also had difference of opinion about it. Nehru's economic policies had layer of naive socialism. Which gave birth to state-owned enterprises. It spread so much that goverment was making wristwatches. Nationalization was core of his economic policies. It's as if he hated the idea of profit. 

JRD and Nehru had disagreement about this point. JRD was of the opinion that it's not government's job to run airline company. It should be noted that JRD's favourite child, Air India was nationalized by Nehru. Patel agreed with JRD on opinion that businesses should be left to businessmen. JRD's opinion was in this context, ""if Sardar Patel was a younger mand and had become the Prime Minister, India would have followed a different path and we could have been in a better economy than we have today""

Now the caller didn't take into account Patel's health. Nor did JRD speak about Nehru's popularity and politics. His only focus for comparison was economy.

Now let's come to present. Nehru's economic policies were criticised by many political parties, including the one currently in power. The criticism includes inefficieny, irresponsibilty, unnecessary hirings and expenses etc. 

Narasimha Rao took stand against this love for state-owned enterprises. Him and Manmohan Singh opned the doors for economic liberalization. Rao was throughly Congressman. But he didn't hesitate to throw policies of his predecessor in the can. Atal Bihari's government came close to Rao's. He pushed privatization and sold state enterprises operating at loss. As a member of BJP he had right to can Nehru. 

Now Vaypayee's party came to power in 2014. This part is business-friendly and progressive. So it was a given that PSU's will get evem more freedom. Sins of Congress had resulted in loss in banks, air india, and other state enterprises. The BJP's admiration for Patel meant that even more economic improvements would be done. As a sign of their admiration, this goverment decided to build a monument for Patel. So far Congressis had ignored Patel so these people decied to build a statue so tall, you could not ignore it. That's how you pay tribute to your heros!

Around 3000 crores Rupees were spent for this glorious monument. Who paid for it? The caller didn't know. 

So this is the list of generous people who contributed to this monument, in Rupees:

- Indian Oil - 900 Crores

- Oil and Natural Gas Commission - 500 Crores

- Bharat Petroleum - 450 Crores

- Hindustan Petroleum - 250 Crores

- Oil India - 250 Crores

- Gas Authority of India - 250 Crores

- Power Grid - 125 Crores

- Gujrat Mineral Development Corporation - 100 Crores

- Engineers India - 50 Crores

- Petronet India - 50 Crores

- Balmer Lawrie - 6 Crores

Does the list ring any bell? All of these are Government owned companies. Who were born because of Nehruvian economics and policies,  which was opposed by Sardar Patel. And his monument is now funded by the same companies.

And the money comes from Corporate Social Responsibility funds of these companies, even written down for preservation ofr arts and culture by some of them.

Who is preserving whose which legacy? Food for thought.",Policy/Economy

Few weeks ago (about one month I think) they came and did something again which fixed the disconnection problem to some extent but there was still disconnection. What was worrying is my connection speed dropped to 2Mbps and below. Guy said it's a server problem and will be fixed, if not fixed then they will come again. 

I know it wasn't a server problem and told the guy multiple times to check. He did nothing and left. 

After that I called exchange multiple times, lodged complaints but all were closed saying fault is fixed. The linemans didn't come either. The exchange used to call and ask if broadband working or not, then after listening my problem he used to cut the call and after few hours I used to ger sms that fault is fixed .

After repeated calls to exchange, lodging complaints from last week the exchange told that the linemans aren't coming to work because they aren't getting salary from six months, they will send someone whenever they come. I waited for few days and called again and again, same story.

Now today they came and was working at the junction box, to my surprise they left without visiting my home. I called exchange to know what's going on and he said they can't fix it, and it won't go up from 2Mbps I'm getting. He told me to talk with officer. 

I said there was something that guys done and probably an easy fix if they reverse what was done earlier. The exchange giy didn't listen to me and hung up on my face! 

That's it BSNL, I don't have enough time and the mental power to take it up with grievance officer. I have suffered enough in last few months and wasted my time. I absolutely loved my time with BSNL, it's the only stable broadband that was available in my area. I don't have Hathway, Act or anything. I even requested them to give fiber line and 1 month earlier seeing my problem they told me that they'll give fiber but even after 1 month nothing progressed. 

Even customer care is clueless lately.

Goodbye my BSNL connection, you will be missed but not that much considering what I had to face at the end. I won't be taking your Fiber connection either.

This entire post is coming  from a guy who was really proud of taking BSNL connection in this era, alas BSNL, you failed me.",Non-Political

"Need help. Friend into drug abuse and possibly feeling suicidal. A college friend of mine (let's call him X) has been working in Pune for a while now. A happy go lucky kind of guy. Loves smoking up, and always jolly.

He calls me off and on when he's high on weed and we talk about random shit.


Recently the way he's been talking has me concerned, the choice of words he's been using isn't really assuring at all. It has started worrying me. 


A mutual friend called me today and asked me about X. He asked if X sounded a bit off and then I told him what he's been talking about these days. This has the both of us very worried now. 


We had a senior who committed suicide and the things that he used talk about is kinda similar to what X talks about too.


So, later in the evening I called X just to talk about random things and I slowly eased into the current scene he's into. He's usually pretty open about the things he does. But today was different, he was just not opening up. It was very very difficult to talk to him.

He kept on talking about frequency, colors, music and a particular ""game"". He kept on telling that we're players and we need to beat this game. He was trying to relate everything to everything. He was just trying to link everything. 


I asked him if he did any hard drugs and then he told me that he did lines of cocaine earlier this month. He was busted and he spent a night in the jail too. He started telling me that it's still in his system and it ""just isn't going out"". I asked him if he did it recently again and he refused.


Even when the mutual friend called me, he told about what X spoke and the ""game"" thing was pretty common. My friend asked X to speak clearly and he was talking nonsense again. X even said ""If I go somewhere tomorrow, or if something happens to me, you'll be able to complete my story"".

Another disturbing thing that X told the mutual friend was he saw our senior (the one that committed suicide) in his dreams and he knows why he did it.


As of now X is on a 2 month notice period, and he told me that the people at his company know about his ""addiction"". Hearing this word, I asked him what he was addicted to and he started telling me that he can't tell it over the phone, he said he was afraid that someone would hear him. He said he'd want to meet us personally and talk about this substance addiction. 

I asked X about the other things he's been doing and he told me that everything has increased, from smoking cigs(every 30 mins) to his daily joints.


We talked a bit more and X knows that things are going downhill for him and he claims he's ready to receive help, he even mentioned rehab clinics. He was even paranoid about people at home plotting things against him. He said he was feeling lonely and he wanted a change of location and a fresh start. 


For now, I told X to call me whenever he feels like it, the mutual friend told him the same thing too. We know he's not himself and he's gone down a very dark path. We don't want it spiralling out of control. What can i do? What is the best possible way to approach this?",Non-Political

"Pros and cons of living in Hyderabad. Feel free to add your perspectives or discuss how your city is better than Hyderabad in the cons department I mentioned here Pros - 

- It's affordable for anybody. 

- Enough uptown cafes and clubs for anyone to explore.

- The distances aren't nearly as far as other metro cities. Travelling the entire stretch of the city shouldn't take longer than 2 hours. 

- The metro makes connectivity to all major areas areas and landmarks easier. The only place it isn't covered is probably Attapur and towards the Airport. 
 
- The airport is almost equidistant from all major residential areas. 

- IT/Corporate hub! Don't have to say more. There are enough opportunities for everybody.  Gachibowli and Hi-Tech city are so well developed that being a resident of this very city, I'm still in awe at how cool the corporate buildings are everytime I go to that part of the town. 

- It's relatively safe, for women especially. Keyword - relatively. You have creeps and psychopaths everywhere, but there are lesser crimes reported from Hyderabad.

- Most locals are welcoming and helpful.

- The GHMC and Hyderabad traffic police are responsible enough to act on infrastructural shortcomings, the regular water logging and the flow of traffic. They make communication easier with their WhatsApp numbers and apps. It's upto you to be outspoken and giving them information via their social media and helpline numbers.

- You see Hindus and Muslims especially living together in harmony. Temples and Masjids literally right next to each other. 
They're really indifferent to whatever the political mood is at the center. It's a good kind of indifference. You almost never see protests or violence in the name of religion, and this city should really be the hallmark of communal harmony for anyone to follow.

- Less traffic during the weekends so you can schedule your recreational plans then.

Cons -

- It's polluted, overpopulated, has a lot of traffic, but this can be said about any major Indian city.

- You have to haggle a lot with autos. They never follow the meter. 

- A lack of last mile connectivity from metro stations to short radiuses. Makes me change plans or compromise with visiting places which are just walkable from metro stations.

- Uber and Ola autos cancel on you if you pay online and not physical cash. 
Uber and Ola do surge a lot and you have to be ready to pay over a 100 to just travel 2-3km.  But again, this holds true for any Indian city and not particularly Hyderabad. 

- RTC buses are a nightmare. Unusable.

- It takes trial and error to know what routes have the worst traffic and around what times during the day/during what festivals. Traffic from Tank Bund is diverted during some festivals because of religious procession. Google maps can't be relied upon completely. 

- Secunderabad has the worst traffic. I was stuck in traffic for over an hour to reach a place which was just 3km away. 

- The weather is harsh - extremely hot summers and very cold winters. You have to be privileged enough to have air conditioning to survive the 45° +  summers. 
Off late, it's not even been raining as much during the monsoon months, and that is concerning in the long run.

- Lack of good colleges and universities for commerce and the arts. There are no good private universities or colleges for the non engineering fields. The Central University called Osmania University has the worst and most redundant curriculums. 
It's however, slightly better for post graduate management education.  
 
- I personally want Hyderabad to have more hobbyist events and activities in terms of art, literature, public speaking, etc. It is at a good place, but still not ""woke enough"" if I may. It can get better. 

Summed up everything I could think of.

I've been living in Hyderabad for almost 8 years now, and I want to move to another city to grow as a person and gain more perspective. But I'm glad to have a place of my own in Hyderabad and be able to ""fall back"" here whenever I want. It's one of the best livable cities for Indian standards.",Scheduled

"Coronavirus lockdown: Tipplers in Kerala with withdrawal symptoms to get special passes to buy liquor Special passes will be issued for tipplers in Kerala to buy liquor but on doctor's prescription that they are showing withdrawal symptoms due to non-availability of alcohol in view of lockdown over novel coronavirus spread.

A decision allowing the purchase of liquor from the Excise department in a ""controlled manner"" was taken by the state government to ""resolve"" what it called many social issues including suicidal tendencies and frustration among people who consumed alcohol regularly.

However, the medical fraternity was up in arms on Tuesday against the government order.

The Kerala Government Medical Officer's Association (KGMOA) has decided to observe April 1 as 'black day' in protest against the order issued late on Monday night.

Dr Vijayakrishnan G S, General Secretary of the KGMOA, called the decision a medical blunder.

The Indian Medical Association(IMA) also flayed the Left government's plan to supply liquor to addicts based on prescription, saying it was not ""scientific"".

Three men in Kerala have committed suicide after allegedly showing alcohol withdrawal symptoms within days after liquor stores shut the doors following the 21-day national lockdown that came into force last Wednesday to try halt the spread of COVID-19. Similar incidents have been reported in other parts of the country including in neighbouring Telangana and Karnataka.

Kerala has the highest per capita consumption of alcohol in the country. The sale of liquor in the state has continued on an upward spiral despite the prohibitive tax on legal alcohol and the many dry days.

The state had a record Rs 14,508 crore liquor sales in 2018-19 sold through the Kerala State Beverages Corporation (Bevco), the state-owned liquor retail monopoly, compared to around Rs 11,000 crore in the previous year, according to official data.

"Fiinovation Assisting Corporations and NGOs in Natural Resource Conservation Projects. **Fiinovation** is committed towards conservation of the natural resources from the  last eight years. This year, understanding the need of promoting water  conservation, rainwater harvesting and plantation, Fiinovation through  its CSR-CSO Partnership practice assisted Uflex and Aroh Foundation in  implementation of CSR initiatives in the national capital region. The  project will be carried out for the next three years where the capacity  of the local communities will be build to conserve and optimize the  natural resource base.

The project is being funded by Uflex which is one of the largest  flexible packaging company in India. Aroh Foundation is engaged in  implementation of the project and have been chosen for the same after  thorough scrutiny of credibility and previous experience of similar  projects.

The Uflex project is being implemented in two villages of Gautam  Budhha Nagar and is estimated to benefit more than 400 farmers. The  project will involve construction of in-situ and ex-situ rainwater  harvesting structures to address the water scarcity concerns of the  people. Aroh Foundation is known for their work in the social  development and environment restoration and will help the farmers build  field bunds and farm ponds to arrest rain water. The project will also  include organic and inorganic mulching to protect the degrading top soil  and plantation drive.

Other aspect of the project is the horticulture production which  shall be grown in the community and individually owned land. The  specific activities will be beneficial for the livestock also due to  availability of fodder all year round in the implementation area. The  farmers will also benefit from the plants bearing fruits.

[Fiinovation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxro9bso574)  expects that the project will increase the ground water levels due to  increased percolation and therefore, there will be better availability  of water for domestic and agricultural use. There are plans for  implementation of similar water conservation projects across India,  especially the drought hit regions. Today, such initiatives are not only  beneficial for the farmers but has become a necessity. It is inspiring  to see corporations such as Uflex investing their CSR funds towards  environment conservation and sustainable development.

Let us hope that through the water conservation projects, India will  be able to resolve the water crisis in  future. Fiinovation urge  corporations to focus on partnerships for implementation of similar CSR  initiatives.",Business/Finance

"(CONFESSION) Kinda Stuck Here Alright people, my post might be a bit self-centered with all the chaos and bloodshed that is happening right now in our capital city. But, I really want to share this out here so as to get some good advice, feedback and discussions.

A few months back, I got a job in very nascent startup and been working there as a Graphic Designer. Tbh, I like everything about the role and the job that I get to do here, people appreciate, validate and respect the work that I am doing here - I have no complaints in that regard.

Sure, being a very new startup, there aren't much co-workers around and the very handful there are, are older to me by a generation or so and thus, we have almost little to none in common with each other. I am also the only designer in my department and thus, things tend to get very lonely for me, at times (though, I've been plagued with loneliness for years now). 

But these aren't a dealbreaker for me and aren't the reasons for why I have made this post in the first place.

The dealbreaker for me however, lies in the fact that I am expected to show up to work for all 7 days. 7\*365. Let alone this, I used to be the kind of person who loathed the idea of there being a 6-day working schedule (as one barely gets to do anything in that single day they get on a Sunday).

I mean, this was made clear to me during interview, when I enquired them about the weekends. And I understand, being a part of the food and beverage industry, the company is expected to operate 24\*7\*365, due to the kind of industry that it is part of.

I thought, after not being in a job for the previous year, my self-discipline and schedule went out of control and thought maybe working all 7 days will get back my old discipline as I thought that it will make me ""more active"" and ""less lazy"". 

And, I guess, I've been proved wrong all the while, simultaneously, my doubts have been proved true too, in regards to working all 7 days.

I struggle to get up early now, even despite getting sound sleep and going to bed early (I made a thread about this, a few days back here). I really feel burned out and am struggling to get my tasks done, due to not being able to focus and concentrate properly. I mean, I felt the burn-out in a mere months after I started working.

Again, I understand the kind of industry I am in, what I don't understand however, is why must I, a designer (well, I am a Marketing Analyst to be more precise, if that helps), needs to show up for all 7 days? I understand the production team needing to show up like that as well, F&B industry but even me too? Besides, the production team, most of them, reside nearby in a lodging whereas, it takes me 40-50 minutes to reach my office and home.

I took a day-off today and whatsapped my boss even, telling him that I need this break as I have been struggling to do my tasks for the past few days for which, he understood and granted.

And thus, I am feeling that this job is too much for me, the schedule at least. Which is sad, as I like almost every aspect of this job, being the only designer in my company, I also don't have any managers supervising or micromanaging ( I report to the CEO directly) and thus, I am bestowed with full control in what I get to do.

The timing is also not fixed. Boss seems like the kind of person who knows what he is actually doing and isn't egoistic, petty or tyrannical in any way.

I honestly don't think that I can get such freedom and privilege anywhere else . And that is why it pains me to share this post as despite all this perks, no matter how good and ""ideal"" a work is for someone, ultimately, there needs to be a break where I could have all the personal time that I crave for and where once, just for once, I don't need to wake up everyday with the thought that I need to go to work for that day. 

Sure, during Sunday I could leave for work earlier than usual but, it defeats the point of keeping it in the first place, doesn't it? To only show up for a handful of hours, there is ample time to get whatever work there is left, in the remaining 6 full days.

My fear is also that, if i resign from this job, I don't think that I would get one anywhere else. Seeking for one for three full months prior to landing in this and eclipsing this from my parents (mother especially, as I feel that they tend to give a typical, Boomer-esque advice that doesn't help me at all and only infuriates me further) was already a cruel and painful experience, man. 

I would quit this in a heartbeat if my mother is an understanding and supportive type. Expect, she is very emotionally abusive and neglectful and will never (and has never in the past too) ever, provide me the support that I want (and even deserve maybe). She will at best, be neutral and at worst, be antagonistic towards me (and she's like that too to both my Dad and sibling).

Based on the feedback I get (and deep down personally), I know that I am not a bad designer, if I try and put effort. And yet, I was sucking in all the interviews that I attended prior. Was it because I am a fresher? I don't want to go to the whole ordeal again.

And thus, I feel like I am stuck here. I am sorry for the long post, but wanted to let this out in the hopes that others can hear and understand the predicament I am in, right now.

TL:DR - Graphic Designer (Marketing Analyst, actually) working for almost 3 months now. Satisfied with everything else, though need to show all 7 days in a week due to the industry and thus, is gradually taking a toll on me. Afraid of quitting and finding a new one in the fears that I won't get any, because of being a Fresher no matter how competent I might be. And also in the fears that I won't get the perks and privileges (that I've described in this post) that I am enjoying here.",Scheduled

Living in India, you'll be given options to pursue a degree in Architecture, Engineering, Medical and other IT/CS or management courses after completion of your Jr. College.
People are so unaware of other amazing courses you can take up.

Now while I'm looking for a Master's degree in Product/Information Design, I see so many Bachelor's degrees in Design that I could've taken up after Jr. College.

I don't regret these three years but I feel foolish for being unaware about such important things in life. I wish I could've known earlier.

Also very disappointed at how people in India emphasize Engineering, Architecture or other technical courses.

"[Rant] I'm seriously tired of this is so called education This is mostly your weekly education rant, nothing new. Throwaway account since I'd like to stay anonymous and wanted to let my thoughts out in the open.

A bit about me first. I loved computers from a pretty young age but at the time I simply loved it as a hobby. I also remember the young me reading tons of books on topics like space and nature. The only thing I was good at my middle school was Physics and Computer Science but kinda ignored all the other subjects. I also loved helping other students with these subjects to the extent teachers would point out to me with ""stop being so noisy"" and ""get back to your seat"" kind of synonyms. I was pretty open to the future wondering what it held for me. Anyway, I decided to pick up Engineering.

Everything has been going in a downward spiral since then. As any typical kid in India trying to get into a good Engineering college, I went to these so called JEE coaching classes. These places were so horrible. Over time, I realised that these coaching classes are simply forcing down material onto their students. If there was some actual learning happening in there, given the vast syllabus, it wouldn't be so surprising whenever a high school kid from India marked an innovation in science. Rather we see students killing themselves for not being able to score good marks in the examination. There is such an intense pressure on kids since you're constantly being told that not making into a good college equates to no woman marrying you and you're going to be working an awful job, if not jobless. In short, your life is going to become so fucked up that we see kids already making peace with death instead. And then out there are some fucking assholes who feel that this is helping in reducing the population of our country by weeding out the unworthy. Just stop making kids at the rate you shit, fuckheads. Instead of making a positive effect in the country, these coaching centres asking for a shitload of money are simply saturating the already saturated field of Engineering in India. Some parents also force their kids to these coaching centres just because of their faculty flaunting their achievements as if they are a God's gift to this world. Anyway, these coaching centres are just a symptom of the core problem of how most reputed colleges in India accept students solely on the basis of one or two examinations and how colleges like to be seduced into being an AICTE approved college. This whole education thing has turned into fucking business.

I failed my JEE since I couldn't keep up. The failure doesn't hurt me, partially because it is my way of rejecting this system. I've come to a realisation that I cannot learn things solely by books and paper, I need to experience it in reality, or I cannot digest anything. Which is why I was probably good in and loved Physics and Computer Science. It costs virtually nothing to see things in motion and see that the equations really do match up, and write computer programs to do stuff for you and everything makes sense. The thing is that doing everything in such a way consumes a lot of time, but I feel it is worth it. It's extremely hard to work on all the high school concepts here and look out for their real world significance at the same time, all when the examinations are pretty much all formulae and rote based.

Anyway, I joined a tier-3 college hoping to at least make it nice in Computer Science since all you need is a Computer to experience anything. But oh lord fuck this place. Just so you know, I spent my high school years learning to program by writing small scripts to manipulate my environment and eventually, I started working with other people to make open-source software. So all this helped me get into GSoC in my very first year of college and worked with some genuine people working hard to make a positive impact to this world. If not for GSoC, I'd also have been forced to attend the ""summer training"" to ""learn HTML &amp; CSS"" along with other students in the college itself, where the students are kept idle for like half the session and you know what all restrictions they put on even when you are idle - no phones, no YouTube, no heads down for taking a break, no talking to other students (seriously?!). I had another friend of mine who did GSoC in the 2nd year but you know what, students were supposed to ""attend a training institute"" by paying the institute money during this summer break but apparently his GSoC wasn't considered since it was seen as an online course (as opposed to going and attending a training institute) by our Head of Department. So, rejected. Poor guy still had to pay a private institute for his forged training certificate despite of working so hard and lie that he worked on both his training and his GSoC project.

I'll talk about some more wonders here. Our college has so called Soft Skills sessions where instead of learning how to communicate properly with other people, you are simply taught how to flaunt and bluff every little thing to everyone and speak hollow words to ""impress"" other people (since in the end, this college only cares about to headline the highest number of placements offered in the Limca Book of Records). Rather than receiving proper technical knowledge, we spend time practising aptitude questions. Many students here have difficulty communicating, structuring grammar and forming sentences in simple English due to their unfortunate backgrounds and yet no work is ever done to help those students become proficient. It's been 3 semesters since we've been studying about Software Engineering and Software Testing to learn the craft of creating and maintain a software, and literally not a single fucking line of code yet! Most students still believe all that there is to testing a software is looking for bugs by hand. There hasn't even been a mention of automated tests and sort till date and I am 3 years in. And, if the authorities find any students good in solving aptitude questions, they are going to differentiate them by making them solve CodeChef problems in extra classes as if remaining students are merely a possession to the college for the time.

We are assigned to work on a team project every semester and are evaluated by professors who have no experience in the said technology the project is based on. These professors then end up judging students by asking standardised definitions from the desired technology in the final viva instead of actually evaluating by asking project specific questions. No wonder the majority of students steal from GitHub or copy-paste projects from their peers, no one cares. Also, the assignment questions are so blunt with hardly any thinking involved, you can look them up and boom you get full marks if you submitted it on time. Now, I could keep listing whatever the hell is wrong here: Minimum attendance: 75% or no exams for you. Students are forced to stay seated and their heads up even if the concerned subject teacher is on leave and the substitute teacher has nothing to teach about. Internet/WiFi is censored by some company called FortiGuard, anyway the Internet hardly works here. Can't eat, roam or leave the campus before 12 noon. Worst of all, there are students who have been so brainwashed that they blindly trust the authorities just because they believe the faculty is truly full of professionals and are the ones who can help them get a job if they keep repeating their words. We aren't really learning anything here of actual use.

I don't even know whether this is the situation for most colleges in India or I just happen to be in one.

Now here is me who helps with some really nice open-source projects, writes technical posts trying my best not to repeat what the Internet already knows, fighting censorship, trying to help my peers and random internet people with anything technical whenever possible, just because I like to care about people.  All this when college eats up my 9+ hours (including commute) everyday, I really feel like a fucking idiot now. What am I even doing. I don't even want to bother with money or be a rich man, just enough to feed myself or if a family happens someday.

"Broke up 30! What next??? Hi Everyone,

I browse through reddit quite a bit and love the answers and support that comes especially under relationships/life.So here goes my story.

A little about myself. I'm 30 yr old Indian woman working in IT and earning well. I am the only kid and my mother raised me as a single parent after my dad left us.She has raised me to be independent and has given me freedom unlike other Indian families.

I had my share of relations when I was young and I was single for a considerable amount of time in mid 20's and I made good use of it. I started traveling and over years have come to love it. Travel opened doors for me in blogging and photography and my friends say I am decent at both. Being single also taught me value of friendships and I'm fortunate to have made some solid bonds over the years.

I met my bf (32 yrs) two years ago and with time we realized we do want to spend our lives together. As we started talking about future I realized that my bf is very keen to move to his hometown and take over his family business/ agriculture (he mentioned it casually once a yr ago. I had no idea he was serious about it).  I refused to agree for this as it is hard for me to relocate to a place which has zero opportunities for career. I hate the idea of staying at home or being dependent for finances. For the reasons above and also that I would be giving up all my friends,leaving my mom,work, travel everything for one person seemed like a bad deal.

We tried to come up with solutions but none of them made of us happy and hence agreed for mutual breakup. This breakup has left bitter feelings in me about everything. I want to stop feeling negative about my ex (somewhere I feel he could have stayed considering he has been staying in the city for 20+ yrs) and stop feeling sad for myself. I am scared that I might end up alone given the age taboo/caste etc in India and quite not sure how to deal with all the negativity in my head.Any suggestions are welcome!

Thanks,

Ablahnaari!

"Blind boomer analogy in India - We are the real boomers With the ""OK Boomer"" memes becoming popular, I've noticed a lot of Indians blindly picking up American boomer arguments and using it in Indian context. The arguments go something to the tune of - you had the best of times, the best jobs, social security, economic growth and are now becoming an impediment to education subsidies and liberal policies that will benefit the present youth.

In the Indian context, these arguments are only partially true. Firstly, the word boomer refers to baby boomers generation born post WW-II (1946-1964). This was the period where the great health-care became accessible to everyone in developed nations and the child mortality dropped fast. However, the birth-rates remained relatively high (though decreasing) and this led to high number of kids being born. This was the golden period of American growth - women and boomers then joined labor force and there was a great productivity rise in labor. Middle-class grew and moved to sub-urbs and could live that idylic existence with benefits of big cities as well as countryside. Boomers led a positive existence - not just that, because the birth-rates decreased subsequently, boomers also had disproportionate power as a voting block (which was bolstered by the fact that the voting % in boomers is much higher than in subsequent generations too). So, they could bring about and keep laws which were in line with their values but were old-fashioned according to their successors. Moreover, older people living on savings hate increase in inflation that comes with debt-fueled government spendings. So, it was natural for this generation to be debt hawks which also meant opposition to subsidies which led to rise in education debt amongst younger generation.Hence, it is a legitimate cause of angst for politically savvy young people who are forced to live in a society controlled by the oldies who support arcane laws (against abortion for instance) and go against their benefits (education subsidies).

However, India has a completely different demographic profile. Purely, in terms of being the largest generation, we are the boomers of India. We were born around or just before the high growth post-liberalization India, have opportunities (in terms of private sector jobs, access to information) that the older generation did not have (boomers had booming economy whereas their parents had depression and war). Even as a political block, the young people have the biggest electoral power amongst all generations (a power that was partially harnessed by BJP when they won two elections). Moreover, with the dropping birth-rates in India, we would also grow old in an era of depressed population growth where we continue to be the most influential generation - just like the boomers!

However, it is also true that the older generation is more bigoted, religiously/caste-wise minded than us and have a role in morally bankrupt polity in this country. There is some blame that we can certainly lay on the older generation. But, the whole boomer spiel of the west wherein the millennial generation claims that the boomers had a much better life and are now actively spoiling the present and future of current youth is certainly not applicable here. Our parents' generation had a life of scarcity in terms of resources and opportunities. Even if you are not interested in reading history or talking to your parents, just watch movies - heroes or characters who were struggling to find work, were getting rejected because they could not pay bribes were part of every story. Apart from government jobs, any city apart from tier-I had little to no opportunities in the license-raj era. Statistically, there was lower economic growth and more poverty.

To see the claims about the older generation led a great life is ridiculous. However, it is true that the young need to break free of the religious and caste fundamentalism that the older generation were a victim of due to their lack of exposure and programming.",Policy/Economy

"Can someone please help me with a few questions about CIBIL Hey guys, I didn't know where else to post this; so I'm sorry if it doesn't belong here. I recently applied, and got approved for a Credit Card, and I just have a few questions regarding the impact of the CC on my CIBIL score. I am planning on applying for a student loan in a year for studying abroad, which is why my CIBIL score is important to me.

I didn't really get a CC for the purpose of having a credit facility. I just got it for the payback points and other perks (like the complementary airport lounge visit). My bank couldn't give me a high credit limit as I am working in an entry level position earning 20k pm. They just gave me a credit limit of 20k. My expenses for a month usually reach around 10k to 15k, which I would like to make using my CC for the payback points. However, as I understand it, having a high credit utilization ratio can have a negative impact on my credit score. This brings me to my first question; if I keep paying off my CC after each transaction, will it reduce my credit utilization ratio. So for example, if I want to spend 15k in a month, I would spend 5k, then pay off the amount due on my CC, spend another 5k, pay it off, and then spend another 5k and pay it off. Does this mean that my credit utilization ratio would be 25%(5k/20k) or would it be 75%(15k/20k) for the said month? Another similar question is, if I spend 45k in a single month like I mentioned above (spend 15k, payoff 15k.....) what would be my credit utilization ratio? Like I said before, I don't really care about availing credit facility and I'm going to be using my CC just like a Debit Card (i.e. paying it off as soon as I spend anything on it).

I hope I explained my question properly, but if not, I would be happy to explain it more in the comments.",AskIndia

*Tips:*

1. Believe only the verified information from reliable source.
2. Be careful and alert in public, keep an eye out for sick, coughing peoples nearby.
3. Keep distance from people. Can be friends or colleagues.
4. Careful buying food, groceries etc. don't touch foods if you don't have to.
5. Wash hands [properly](https://www.who.int/gpsc/media/how_to_handwash_lge.gif).
6. Avoid Handshakes, Use verbal greetings instead.
7. Cough within [elbow angle](https://images.megapixl.com/1783/17830764.jpg).
8. Don't touch anything if you don't have to e.g. Bus, Train, vehicle poles and door handles.
9. Carry Hand sanitizer if you can.
10. Apply the sanitizer on area you touch like ATM, bus poles or other public used things you need to touch. ( little awkwardness in public is better than getting sick )
11. Non-essential gathering in large groups must be avoided. e.g. sport events, concerts, meetups etc.
12. Get more information from [WHO.int](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) or other verified research institute.
13. suggest..

*Thoughts:*

Personally called few numbers to correct the map address. Found out in gMap they had different names. So please check the map links and make sure you're going to right address. Before calling them do your research. ""Get  info"" calls can make a line busy and  real people in need suffers.

When calling few centers myself, a person received my call asking if they are the govt assigned center to test corona, he got scared at first just by hearing the name. Which made me wonder how less information he might have about the pandemic. I hope you get all the right information about this threat. Wash hands as much you should, definitely more. And please be kind to others, if you feel sick of corona symptoms please do not take it lightly. Get help, ask for help. Do use mask, self hygiene, self quarantine and don't spread. You might spread it to your family and friends first (the closest we get ) so most of all don't be a dick. We can fight this by fighting the urge to get close to people washing hands.

"Need help regarding JEE mains and if I should take drop for next year. (posted on Indian Academia also)  

I'm back!

So  a while back I posted here and wanted your opinions regarding some  (weak) circumstances but anyways I had a change in decision.

I've  decided to take drop and try for jee mains in January and April again next year even tho I haven't scored enough in boards(64% aggregate,  54.9% in pcm) for iits/nits/iiits but am still eligible for decent engineering colleges like:-

DTU, New Delhi (through jee mains+ JAC)

COEP, pune (through MHT-CET)

RVCE, Bangalore (through COMED-K)

VJTI, mumbai (through MHT-CET/JEE MAINS + DTE COUNSELING)

DAIICT, GUJRAT (through jee mains)

and everyone's  fav MIT,Manipal (through MU-OET).

Now  my parents want to (and I mean really in a very toxic manner) send me to a local shitty private engineering college(where ofcourse uniform and 75% attendance is mandatory), and prepare myself for coding independantly(lol) because a relative of mine (who is from iit-kharagpur ofc) told them to, and then do masters from some US college(which won't  happen if I join said shitty college for Btech). And I really want to  have a decent job after my bachelor's before I decide my further education,atleast for a while.

The thing is I want to enjoy my college life(I guess?) a bit and actually have a decent chance at good job prospects in the future, plus I'm still a bit unsure whether chasing engineering would be a good idea for a lazy student like me but hell I can do something my parents wish for me to do. Also will try my hand at IELTS and reach for foreign colleges in  europe (less expensive than US and Australia), tho that seems unlikely since my parents are unwilling in that matter.

So  fellow redditors, please give me some insights/opinions on whether I'm making a sound decision or not,and if yes, how shall I prepare for JEE MAINS since I haven't touched a book for months and really have not much guidance as of now. I would also like to know if preparation for JEE would be enough for other entrance examinations like MUOET, COMED-K, etc.  Also I would really like to self study and avoid coachings (never could use them to an advantage), and amount of books shouldn't be a problem. I'm also weak in chemistry and my math concepts (a majority of them) are  terribly fucked. I'm willing to put in the hours tho promise (even tho I'm prone to mood swings and demotivation, but my career is on the line, hell my life is).

Sorry for the formatting as I typed this on the mobile app, and also I meant no offence to anyone going to any engineering college, it's just my elder friends really warned me about their situation and they were Frank af  with me so I thought the wording shouldn't be very offensive, but if it is I'm really sorry, and thanks again:)

Edit: by eligible I meant my board Marks are enough for mentioned colleges and that I need to improve my jee rank (hence why I wanted to take a drop). I'm not actually eligible for iits/nits/bits etc. Due to low percentage in board exams. Hope it clears the confusion.",AskIndia

"Road trip in December 2019 Planning a 20 day vacation in India. My starting base will either be Bengaluru (in-laws home) or Mumbai (parents home). I've driven in India before so I know what I'm getting into. I'll be renting out either a small crossover (Creta) or a hatchback. What ever I can find with an automatic. Plan is to spend the first 3 days in the city (visiting family) and then the next 10-12 days on the road trip. I do prefer the mountains but I've already driven to Lonavalla and Ooty. Preferably would love to see the Himalayas so might fly to Delhi and then take a rental from there though that adds additional steps that might not be convenient (got a handicapped 5 year old). Plus worried about pollution **points at kid**. Both me and my wife are photographers and want to stay away from city life. Any recommendations are welcome. I initially wanted to ask this on the team-bhp forum but they keep refusing to accept my registration... ugh!!

Thanks

Edit: Have two preference. One is to drive to multiple locations or drive to one location and use that as a base to visit nearby places. I'm okay with long drives. Just would like to avoid night driving on unlit road (had a bad experience earlier)",AskIndia

"Is Indian government just memeing about electric cars? I'm pretty heavily into cars so I follow the industry news very regularly.

One news item that makes the round every few months is about Indian government's grand plans to make Indian roads fully-electric.

Read these news stories and you can't help but imagine that in a decade, Indian roads will be utopias where Teslas and Mahindra E2Os will glide silently pass you on their way to a solar powered recharging station.

Some samples:

* [India plans to have seven million EVs by 2020](https://mercomindia.com/india-plans-deploy-seven-million-electric-vehicles-2020/)

* [India to sell only EVs by 2030](https://www.timesnownews.com/business-economy/industry/article/only-electric-vehicles-to-be-sold-after-2030-in-india-niti-aayog/438731)

* [Only electric two-wheelers to be sold in India by 2025](https://www.news18.com/news/auto/bjp-led-nda-government-mulling-to-sell-only-electric-2w-3w-in-india-2023-onwards-2171395.html)


Is the government just memeing? As everyone knows, India has no viable EVs in the market. The only electric four-wheeler is the aforementioned E2O (which Mahindra discontinued). All the other EVs on the market are either e-rickshaws or shitty Chinese scootys.

To add to that, there is no charger network. None whatsoever.

Against the target of 70,00,000 EVs by 2020, India has met just 1/10th of that by 2019. Worse, the number of four-wheeled EVs sold in 2019 was a mind-boggling 3,600. [source](https://www.autocarindia.com/car-news/ev-sales-in-india-cross-75-lakh-mark-in-fy2019-412542)

China has shown that with concentrated action, you can do a lot to promote EVs. The country promoted EVs aggressively in 2009 and within a decade, has the world's largest EV market.

Moreover, within a decade, nearly 6% of passenger cars in China are electric.

Meanwhile, India is poised to reach the 5% EV penetration target...in 2030 [source](https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/indian-car-scene/210483-kotak-merely-5-indian-cars-will-electric-2030-a-3.html)

How on earth does India plan to achieve its lofty EV goals? Given the precarious nature of our environment and the horrible air quality in our metros, shouldn't promoting EVs be a priority? 

Yet all I keep reading are meme-tier news stories with nothing in the way of concrete subsidies for EV and charging network manufacturers.",Science/Technology

"Kerala Chief Minister duty-bound to approach me: Governor Arif M. Khan New Delhi: Kerala Governor Arif Mohammad Khan has said that the Constitution gives him many options and he will take a decision at an appropriate time on Kerala’s Pinarayi Vijayan-led Left Democratic Front government moving the Supreme Court against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

“As far as I am concerned, the rules of duties are clear. It is already established how the Chief Minister is supposed to approach me. The Chief Minister is duty-bound to approach me before he passes any such order. My role is to see that the state works according to the rules. I am not claiming supremacy,” he told The Sunday Guardian.

Khan said it was his duty to ensure that the rule, law and Constitution were followed in letter and spirit in the state. “Also, it is my responsibility to ensure that the Constitutional machinery does not collapse,” he said.

“Be you ever so high, the law is above you. You have to respect the law. Once the President has given assent to a law, as Governor, I have the right to protect it. I am moving in a Constitutional way. I am not a rubber stamp,” said the Kerala Governor.

The plea filed by the Kerala government under Article 131 of the Constitution on disputes between Centre and states, stated that the CAA violates the right to equality under Article 14 of the Constitution of India, right to life under Article 21 and freedom to practice religion under Article 25. The Kerala Assembly also passed a resolution earlier demanding scrapping of the CAA, claiming that the Act, which was passed after following due process by Parliament, was unconstitutional.

Saying that “dissent is the essence of democracy”, Khan cited the Constitution to accuse the Pinarayi Vijayan government of violating the law on key issues like passing a resolution or challenging the CAA in the Supreme Court, without keeping him in the loop.

“I have no problem with the government, Opposition, or anybody holding a different view on CAA, NRC (National Register of Citizens) or NPR (National Population Register). Everyone is free. But my only point is the rules should be followed as stipulated by the Constitution,” he said.",CAA-NRC-NPR

Say a family has got 3 acres of land and has got 2 boys and 1 girl. Each acre will be given to each child. Will this 1 acre be considered the dowry, or will dowry be something else plus the 1 acre of inheritance?

"I rant. This is just an expression of my personal opinions; if you disagree, I would like to listen to your opinion as well.

Firstly, I wish everyone good health and safety during this pandemic. Now that the entire country is virtually locked down, protests have stopped, and now is the time for introspection.

* I have a feeling that the protests are aiming at the wrong thing. Yes, the CAA-NPR-NRC is extremely diabolical and dictator-like; yes, it is going to choke an already suffocating Indian economy. But, there is something that the BJP-RSS have successfully diverted attention from. It is extremely unpleasant that this is not receiving the required attention.
* On February 14, 2019, a JeM terrorist rammed an explosive laden truck into a group of CRPF jawans, killing 40 of our dear soldiers. On 26 February, the Indian Government ordered an airstrike on Pakistan, an unprecedented move, in retaliation. The next day, the newspapers reported the Government's claims: the airstrikes purportedly killed 300 terrorists in a ""high-tech and luxurious"" camp, with swimming pools, etc.
* A Reuters report suggested that the airstrikes did nothing; the high-tech camp turned out to be a run down madrasa, the bombings barely damaged the madrasa, and there certainly weren't any ""300"" terrorists. BJP rode to power exploiting an anti-Pakistan emotion and romanticising the Indian Military, something that the Opposition could not oppose the BJP on, considering the election time and the sensitivity.
* Around two months ago, Dy.SP Davinder Singh was caught with terrorists. You just need to search his name up on Google to find out everything. When he was posted in Shopian in 2017, a terrorist attack took place. Worse, he was posted at *Pulwama* when the 14 February attack took place. The manner in which the NIA, headed by Y.C. Modi (who gave a clean chit to the cunt Modi for the 2002 riots), snatched the case from the J&K Police is extremely unsettling, as the J&K Police are capable of taking up such a case, considering the security status of J&K. Furthermore, even on the godi media channels, this issue was toned down heavily, signifying one thing - *the BJP-RSS combine knew about this and worse, they could have planned it.*
* They certainly planned it. They either let the Pulwama attack take place or planned it themselves. The fact that they used the Balakot strikes as an election strategy proves that they didn't chance upon the opportunity - it was months in the making. This is extremely dangerous, because we have two obese cunts with every desire to stay in power - even if it means treason or death. We also know that all the planning is done at Nagpur (RSS HQ) meaning there definitely was RSS's hand in it as well.
* We need to step up our vigil and bring this issue to light. Why haven't we heard an udpate since then? Why is it that even after a year, the govt. is unable to apprehend the Pulwama suspects?Now that our only means is social media, we **must** step up our pressure on the Government. A few ways to do that are: do no argue with RSS trolls on social media, flood the feed with questions, reports, anything you find. Do not waste time or energy retweeting or giving unnecessary attention to bigoted statements of attention-seeking whores.
* Secondly, Shaheen Bagh has to disperse. They cannot stay there, especially during a pandemic. It's a risk to their health and gives an opportunity to stoke hatred for them again. We must appeal to them to disperse; it will be in the interest of the true spirit of the country.
* Thirdly, it is 100% true that the only party that has the capability to oppose the BJP is the Congress. But not with fucking Rahul Gandhi. Let him get another time to prove his shot, not now. Scindia's defection should be an eye-opener. We *have* to pressurise the Congress to purge itself of the Family Power, and even all the politicians who stay only for power. Keep only those who are loyal and ideologically committed. Listen to Tharoor, hold elections for the President. It will take time to reorganise Congress, but there still are 4 years until the next elections.
* This rant is long and tedious to read, but I urge you to pay heed to my two cents. We must remember that we are fighting an ideological enemy, years in the making, disciplined, trained and dreaming for this very moment for years. Protests are good, but we fail to understand one thing: even our protests lack a bit in secularity. True secularism comes from celebrating diversity, not repressing it under the guise of equality and irreligious temper.

"Vegetarianism in India has more to do with caste hierarchy than love for animals 
Why do vegetarians in India prefer social distance from non-vegetarians? A look at caste-wise food preferences could provide some insights. As is common knowledge, the ranking of castes is mostly influenced by purity of occupation and diet. In caste-society, to achieve purity of body and spirit, it is necessary to be a vegetarian and religious simultaneously – something best embodied by a Brahmin.

The percentage of non-vegetarians among Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, both for men and women, is much higher than among those who are not from these communities. And in the latter group, the highest incidence of vegetarianism is found among Brahmins at almost over 50%. The higher the caste, the greater the possibility of them being pure vegetarians.

The burden of diet-purity and vegetarianism is, however, more on women than men.

Broadly, present-day vegetarianism in India constitutes a form of moral power of minority within Hindus, with such a power being forced on the non-vegetarian majority – with their consent. This new sociality is a sign of progress in modern caste belief where the seductive power of vegetarianism and its associated purity travels seamlessly across bodies and spaces without dissent.

How fragile must the morals of the vegetarian castes be if they feel threatened by the introduction of eggs for poor children in schools? The morals of Indian vegetarians continue to be based less on compassion for humans and animals, and more driven by ideas of hierarchy and purity. In this scheme of hierarchy, one who eats beef is placed at the lowest rung. Like humans of caste, not all animals carry equal sympathy: there exists some hierarchy where the cow (indigenous, not jersey) takes the highest sacral form compared to the rest. Gandhi improvised his vegetarianism through inflicting violence and control on the self. Present-day caste-subjects and their vegetarianism, however, thrive on violence, both on the self and others. The state across India through various governments has mostly been party to this process, promoting the hegemony of misguided vegetarianism.",Food

"Jaipur or Gwalior? Please help with India itinerary! My mom and little brother will come visit me on my extended solo trip through India. We will have about two weeks together, of which one we will spend in Delhi (long time I know, but this can´t be changed).
The remaining time we will go to Shimla for two or three nights, Vrindavan for one night, and either Jaipur or Gwalior for three nights - but which one of these two?

I recommended Jaipur (been there before), my mom said she doesn´t want it to be too touristy. She found some pics of Gwalior online and wants to go there instead. I fear that other than the fort, there won´t be much to do in Gwalior. Also I´m not sure whether it´s actually good to go to Gwalior just because there will be less tourists - maybe that is a disadvantage ( re. accomodation, transport, places to eat, and general acceptance of tourists).

"Why India's system sucks? Ok...This is a real story happened in my life.
We are a middle class family and my dad worked hard to raise our family. He became a dealer of a motorcycle business and he is my role model and superhero. In 2018 using his hard earned money and a loan he planned to get a own house. Bought a land and appointed a mestri(head workman) for the house. 

In July, that mestri appointed a old person for transferring cement bags from one floor to another floor. He didn't eat properly the before day and that day he also didn't eat before coming to work. After transferring few bags he took rest my mom thought of giving him butter milk so when she went to get that from my old home that worker fainted and died. 

Emergency ambulance people came and verified that the person is died and the policemen came and asked something and told that nothing to worry. His people took his body. So we all thought that everything is completed and continued our normal life.

The very next day so many people from his caste and his relatives came and occupied the nearby streets and road. My mom was worried so she with her brother went to the person who is reputed person of our caste but that person started talking wrongly about my mom and her brother. The watchman at the construction went away with his family. Relatives didn't come to help. My dad came from other town at that evening. He went to the police station along with the other person from other caste for support. Police constable started framing wrong stories. The so called reputed person from our caste started supporting the died person caste people. The police man started talking vulgarly and he beated my dad with his belt. They refused to do postmortem. They told that if dad gives 9 lakh rupees to the other caste members then only they will do the postmortem.

So my dad had to pay 9 lakhs the very next day and the police agreed for postmortem. In the postmortem report it was stated that the person who died has heart and digestion problems. 


From that day I started considering caste as a filthy term. Loosing money is not the issue but seeing my dad in that position is the major heart break for me. He refused to fight against that because he is afraid of the system. Ofterall we are middle class OC people.

"Trip Advise: Uttarakhand/Himachal - June or later - 2 people - 3/4 days Hi,

I'm planning a honeymoon trip to either Uttarakhand or Himachal for me and my fiance (Provided Corona settles down). These two are the places that we're interested in right now, but suggestions are welcome for any other hillstation/scenic places too. Budget is around 50k flexible for 3/4 days and 3/4 nights.

Even though Shimla/Manali were common choices, it looks airports are far from these places and I don't wanna sit in bus/car for 9hrs+ straight. I'm looking for places which have airports much closer and Dehradun came up. I was thinking of may be covering Dehradun, Nainital etc. in June.

1. Are Dehradun and Nainital good for a peaceful honeymoon trip? I'm not looking to cover a lot of places with a tight schedule. I'd rather visit a few calm and quiet scenic places and spend a bit of time there.
2. Is the weather nice there in June or will it be too hot? Also in case Corona situation continues how's the weather during July/August? I don't wanna extend it too much to really cold weather either.
3. I'm planning to book hotels on my own and hire a cab with driver for the duration. Any suggestion on this? Looking for reliability more than anything, since this will be our first trip I don't want any hassles as you can imagine. Or any reliable packages that I should look into?
4. Any other scenic places near to these locations that I must visit? Like I mentioned before I don't wanna spend a lot of time in car especially if the terrain is rough.

"Strategy to reduce open defecation in rural communities. How can local government help and incentivize? (And other questions!)  

Hi [r/india](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/),

I need to find out some information about the powers, structure and management of local government in rural india.

&amp;#x200B;

**Background:** I work at a UK water company and am working on an extra-curricular charity project with WaterAid. Part of this project is to 'develop a strategy to reduce open-defecation in rural communities.' Specifically we are focusing on the district of *Bhadrak*. We are able to make use of volunteers in the area, small amounts of cash provided to each village where twin-pit toilets have been installed (about $100 per village), medical/health care centres/professionals, community groups and schools.

&amp;#x200B;

I won't go into detail of root causes of open defecation, as I'm sure anyone in India would be fully aware, but briefly the root cause is that in rural communities it is the cultural and behavioural norm to defecate in the open. Reasons such as believing toilets to be unhygienic, not wishing to share with in-laws, men not wanting to 'hide their shame', not wanting to do the work of emptying toilet pits are a few. The problems this leads to are multiple health and economic issues as well as huge risk of violence against women.

&amp;#x200B;

So far we have strategies to educate, inform etc etc using the volunteers via all the channels we have available to us (classroom activities, women's group education and discussion, medical practitioners discussing defecation when they meet patients and so on). However our overall goal to tie it all together is to get locals who support hygienic toilet use to petition for a Gram Sabha on the issue. It's my understanding that 10% of  18+ villagers (or 50 villagers, whichever is higher) are needed in order for this to happen . The overall strategy is based on influencing people through each of these opportunities, find champions to support the idea and petition for Gram Sabha. Then, *I don't know what we should be aiming for from there?*

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is what powers does the Gram Sabha/Gram Panchayat have. I understand the basic structure of local government, but *we need to figure out what we actually want to come out of Gram Sabha. What could they do to help fight this issue?*

&amp;#x200B;

**Local Government:**

\- How much funding do they get and how much can they spend on non-centralised (local) projects

\- What powers does the local government have that can help incetivize changing behaviours

\- Are there community votes at Gram Sabha or are decisions made by entirely by government

\- Can decisions be made without Gram Sabha

\- Is a Gram Sabha releated to the issue of open defecation realistic?

\- What does the process of villagers petition for a Gram Sabha look like?

&amp;#x200B;

**Other questions you may like to help me with:**

\- How can you incentivize rural, religious communities to change their behaviour.

\- Are there any major issues I've missed leading to open-defecation in rural communities and how could we counteract them?

\- Do you live or know anyone in a rural community (or do you practice open defecation)? - ***I would love to speak to you***

\- Does anyone know of, or have ideas of, cheap retro-fit ideas for the twin pits (to improve accessibility for elderly/disabled people)

I would be very grateful for any help, insight or advice anyone can offer. I really feel like in order to develop a successful plan I need the perspective of people from India, so please help me! Thank you guys!

"Abrogation of Article 370 and 35A. Why now ? What was the urgency ? Players involved:

&gt;RAW, ISI , Pakistan Government(PG), Govt of India(GoI) , US Govt, Taliban

Some facts first :

* Trump is in deep waters if he loses 2020 elections, may even go to jail. He wants a win badly, to sell to his vote base . His focus :
   * Trade deal with China.They are not budging
   * Nuclear Deal with North Korea, thats why his chummy messages for Kim-jong-un. They are not budging either. Just recently they conducted missile tests.
   * Iran. Not happening fast enough. All other against pulling out of the deal.
   * Mexico : Wall not happening.
   * Afghanistan. He wants to pull out all his troops from there.
* Out of all these, Afghanistan one seems most doable, since it only requires a deal with Taliban. A non-govt entity, which cant wait it out to end Trump's tenure.

So how come India and Kashmir gets into this particular picture ?

Trump wants to pull out  from Afghanistan since they have realized that they are fighting a losing war in Afghanistan, against Taliban, like Vietnam war(many parallels here : Nixon--&gt;Trump ; Kissinger--&gt; Zalmay Khalizad ; VietCong --&gt; Taliban). Now to get Taliban to talks, they need someone with sway over them, so enters Pakistan. If Pakistan /ISI is able to break a deal between Taliban and US, they would get into good books of Trump, hence renewal of Aid, removal of sanctions (FATF).

5 July, RAW Chief briefs PMO that US and Taliban could reach an agreement by 1st September. So if we want to get full control of Kashmir, the time is now. Because Trump may choose to reward Pakistan by meddling in this front. He already knows the situation (Courtsy Balakot, and Abhinandan's release negotiations. US govt was involved, Trump announced the 'good news' before Pakistan).

Direct quote from HT times article :

*.... following which Washington could choose to reward Islamabad for its role with the resumption of military and economic aid. That could lead to an intensification of Islamabad’s direct and indirect sponsorship of terror groups operating in Kashmir. If India had to make the move on J&amp;K’s special status that was on the government’s agenda, there wasn’t a lot of time to lose.*

22-23 July : Biggest blunder by Trump . Imran Khan was visiting US. And Trump said Modi has personally asked him to mediate on Kashmir, a claim refuted first by US state officials themselves. then by Indian officials. This was the final nail in the coffinn by thr US, clearly indicating a deal between US govt and Pak Govt could actually happen on Kashmir. Time to take action was now, or this could get really ugly in coming years (internationally)

So, what happened next ?

India sent Satellite phones and Heron drones in Kashmir.

Increased number of troops.

Closed Amarnath Yatra.

GOT FULL CONTROL OF KASHMIR, IN FORM OF UNION TERRITORY.

We can discuss all the legal, moral aspects of the manoeuvres done to achieve that (Curfew,house arrests, comm blackout etc.), but for GOI, it was now or never. And they choose now.

When there are some stuck without homes and nowhere to go. I love the way some elites are positing their fitness videos on the social media. When there are 1000s of migrants walking 100s of miles and this is not for exercise. I love the way people are posting their favorite recipe pictures on Instagram. When there are people sitting in the middle of the roads eating whatever is handed out to them out of kindness. I love the way people screamed and shouted at the airports when they were quarantined for a few hours.Wonder how many of them were herded together and sprayed with chemicals. There are two different Indias that we live in. One for the rich and one for the poor. Sometimes, we are unable to see beyond our life, our world, our zones of comfort. I know we don't do it deliberately, it's just that we don't realize what we are doing because we haven't seen the India of the poor. We have been shielded away from it. Forget about understanding, we can't even empathize with that India. The India of the poor. Hopefully, some day we will be able to look beyond these boundaries and recognize the other side of India, which is starving and fighting for their lives, even as we show discomfort of being locked down for a few days.

"As an NRI, my personal view on the Serious emigration thread. Here is the original thread: https://old.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dcquo0/serious_emigration_threat_is_it_helpless_yet/

As a person emigrated to Germany, I want to chip in my personal view as to what it takes to make me come back to India. 

tl:dr; I won't be back as of now! May be in future!

Long version:

u/ozonised has compiled very good list of what issues exists and what can be improved.

Infrastructure: I come from Hyderabad and being a capital city the infrastructure is shit! It took more than 10 years and massive amount to build a metro, and that too it's over the top metro not an underground. The roads are already congested and these fools installed metro pillars in between the roads, congesting it even more. The city sewage is still from the Nizams era and nothing substantial has been done to improve it. Every year in rainy season, roads and buildings are submerged in water.

Ride bike for one hour, take a clean cloth and swipe on your face, a black layer come off. That's the pollution in the city. Auto and public busses emit black gases from exhaust! You are literally breathing that shit day in, day out. Just creating better transportation does not make a place livable. You need to plan for the future and build something sustainable! There is no greenery in the city and becoming concrete jungle! Every year when I visit Hyd, I regret roaming on the streets because of that black smoke.

Please make the city more livable. Yesterday there was news about cutting down trees in Aarey park, mumbai to make way for Metro! We need to progress and build infrastructure considering nature not the other way round. It takes just a strong will to inspect/make every person riding a vehicle to follows correct emission standards.

Healthcare:  
Healthcare is completely different topic. Last year, as a challenge to get an MRI for my Cervical Spondylosis problem, my father asked me to get it done in Osmania Hospital. I visited for 20 days and tried to get an appointment with a Neuro doctor and MRI without paying a bribe, sadly I gave up and got it done in a private hospital.

Have you ever visited the pregnant ward in any govt hospital? If you don't puke, I would congratulate you. Imagine women carrying a child for 9 months and then delivering among other 20 women in a congested room and pathetic conditions. Healthcare is literally on their knees.

- Did you know 2 years back Indian mangoes were banned in germany because they were using chemicals to ripe them! 

You know what can be done? Just a good officer and good inspection to keep premises clean and healthy. Checkout the amsterdam cycling documentaries, the govt responded to the public demand and created more cycling infrastructure, so that people can bikle freely and resulting in massive decline in health problems.

Academics: 
The plight of private schools looting parents came to mainstream due to Delhi govt. Kudos to them for bringing awareness. Private schools are robbing and public schools are getting closed due to lack of funds!! Govt has no money to run schools but they make a 3k crore statue. I saw some days back in UP, a school was serving rice with salt as mid-day meal. Are we in such a fucking pathetic situation that we can not give a curry/dal with rice for our future generations? Don't get me started on quality of education. Why can't govt schools have English subject? Why do they have to teach only in regional language? I saw many govt school students under confident when they start college.

In Germany I can study for free until my PG. I can work under professors and also get paid handsomely if I do research. You know what, as a student I pay just 52€(4000 INR) for one semester/6 months and can take part or play as many times. Open the following link with chrome and translate it. https://hsp-hh.sport.uni-hamburg.de/sportangprogramm.htm. It would be mind boggling to know every student in the city can take part in so many sports. You would be overwhelmed when you see the sport infrastructure this country has! I have never played any sport except cricket and thankfully to Germany I played so many sports you can't even imagine and that too almost free! 

You can also take as many courses you want by paying 110€(8k INR) for 6 months. When you earn more then 2.5k€ every month 110€ for 6 months is nothing! Why would I leave this and come back to nothing, where I can get sick just by breathing that shitty air?

Policies: Check out the startup culture here in Berlin and Munich area. In India, we have so many IIT's and lakhs of students graduating every year. What is stopping the Govt from creating a Startup fund and make policies that encourage the fresh minds to create fresh Ideas? They have a startup fund and I guess it has gone to the wind! 

Me, My elder brother and younger sister all are CS students. We are actually working on our startup that would be headquartered in Germany and branch out in India. Do you know why? because we get better funding here and exposure is fucking awesome! Every city has Startup hacks/meetups/pitches! I don't want to start our startup in the red tape of Indian bureaucracy. To be honest, It's a shame that in a country like India, we are lagging behind in Startup world!

Employment: Better startup policies, better infrastructure, better education directly leads to creating more opportunities! No magic wand. I am in my 20s and working on my company, there are lakhs of people like me, but sadly working that shitty 9-5 job in some big company. Just look around and see the jobs created by Zomato and Swiggy, the cash they brought into market from consumers. Imagine startups like these on a massive scale! It would change the face of our country. Our economy needs to be more open and welcoming!

My brother used to work in East Asia and came back to India and he regrets every day. The daily commute, traffic jams, pollution is literally killing him. As the first comment from u/mrfreeze2000 says, ""There are two types of people who emigrate: better pay/lifestyle, and better work"". I Emigrated because of both. You know Its Illegal to make me work on Sat & Sunday. If an exceptional situation arises that I have to work on Saturday, my company has to get permission from Labour office!

- I get 6 weeks of Paid holidays + public holidays
- I can travel 27 countries. Just pack your bags and hop in your car. Los geht's!
- I get PR after working for 3 years or 2 years with German B1 certificate. No Shitty visa issues like in US of A. 
- I can become German citizen in 6-8 years.
- I can take as many sickness leaves i want. It's my right. I dont do it, just saying.
- If my wife is working and expecting a child, she gets 14(fourteen) months of paid maternity leave. As a father you can also take paternity leave.
- My whole family is covered under my Health insurance covering from fever to cancer. 
- Children go to awesome schools here to learn, they can take music as a subject or any sport and all of this is free.
- If I ever got fired, I get arbeitslosengeld(Job Loss money), for 1.5 years I guess.
- Better infrastructure, better health and Hospitals, better care, better money, better air. 

Lastly, I guess this was written by non-muslim person(sorry to bring in Religion). As a muslim myself, my father urges me not to come back to India ever, given the cancer that has spread in recent years. I have desis saying to my face anti-national or paki here in Germany and least I expect that India. I stopped going to Indian festival gatherings here because I fear some dickhead will ask why I came there and what is my intention. Some years back I could trust my fellow Indians and now I lost that hope. Just for reference check this tweet (https://twitter.com/rohini_sgh/status/1180165971006197765), this is the cancer our country has acquired! You don't know the humiliation we are facing these days. Every damn thing has been turned into whataboutery. The current regime spined the propaganda about minority appeasement? What minority appeasement, muslims situation is worse than SC/ST's and that too without reservation. 

Why would I leave all these and come back to India to suck all that shit? I love my country and think of it now and then, but do I miss it? Nah! Do I miss the culture? absolutely yes! Do I want to come back and live there? Nope. Sorry.

Edit: Thanks u/kash_if for the silver!

"What do you do when your own family subscribes to the ‘goli maaro’ ideology? [rant] I hate the Godi media so much right now. During the lockdown I was visiting my parents. We live in a large joint family setting. Now my every morning starts with Hindu Muslim hate speech as newspapers (Hindi) are read and tv news channels are put on loud. Of course they haven’t even subscribed to any remotely sane news channel. I isolate myself in a small room at the back of the house to get away from it but the shrill voice of frothing at the mouth anchors permeates everything. 
What’s worse is that after being fed their daily dose of toxicity, family members discuss it all day with glee. They call up other distant relatives and say stuff like “TJ ke bare mein suna apne? Gaddar hain ye log. Modi ji ko inhe chodna nahi chahiye. Inka ek hi ilaaj hai. Line mein khada karke goli maaro sabko”
Since yesterday, when news broke of some guy getting shot for saying TJ is behind coronavirus in India, they are targeting me with sarcastic and laced with toxicity pseudo-debates. Pseudo because they don’t really want to engage in discussion, they only want to humiliate me for my views. Maybe they secretly think I’m a gaddar too. 
I’m desperate to get out of this house and get back to my own home (another city) but I cannot till lockdown is lifted. Now it seems that it may not happen on 14th as planned earlier. I’m feeling so trapped and it’s disturbing my mental peace. I don’t know how to deal with so much toxicity and hate everyday day after day.

I honestly do not know what I even got.. to my regret.. I just pointed at something random and they served me a plate of this chicken with some type of thickish orange sauce (some type of curry?). It was honestly the most delicious thing I have ever eaten. Anyways, there's an Indian restaurant near me and I plan on ordering food there tomorrow. What are your recommendations of what I should try next? I'm thinking of a chicken entree.

It should be noted that worldwide more people die due to air pollution than what the covid19 has claimed till date.

While we have been very serious about tackling the virus threat we have literally done nothing to tackle the air pollution threat which claims more lives.

Sanjiv Bhatt may or may not be innocent, but it is clear that  Modi can stoop to any level to ruthlessly destroy his opponents. Sanjiv Bhatt was sentenced for life in a 30 years old case.

"Advice on joining OYO Rooms as a SDE 2 Hi Folks ! Hope you all are doing well.

I recently interviewed with OYO for an SDE2 role at Hyderabad. The interviews went well and looks like I'll get an offer. I'm working at an MnC currently with a stable job and decent pay. Having never worked in a startup-like environment I would really appreciate some advice on the following things which would help me make a better choice. If any of you are current or former employees of Oyo that would be even better !

1. I've been reading a bit about Oyo in Reddit and one post talks about how Oyo is fudging numbers to show false growth. How true is this claim ? Not that it matters to a software dev but I would like to know what kind of a company I'm planning to work at.
2. How is the work culture ? One of the complaints about by current company is that its not very adaptive to latest tech. So it is pretty important to me that I get the freedom to choose what tech I want to use.
3. I read somewhere that you might be asked to work on Saturdays. Is this true ? If yes, how frequently does that happen ?
4. Lastly what kind of a salary can I expect for my profile ? (see below)

Here's my current profile:

* Current Role: Tech Lead (Promoted less than 2 months ago)
* Experience: just over 4 years

Thanks in advance !",AskIndia

"Planning to buy a second hand scooter on OLX when I noticed something strange. Need advice. Hey,

So I've been studying in Bangalore, and have been looking around to buy a scooter for myself, for daily commute. The cheapest option for me, and one which I kind of had a liking towards, was the Honda Navi. Since I need it only for the next 3 years, I was looking at second hand options.

All the listings I had seen earlier were already sold.

Yesterday I came across a listing for a Navi on OLX, mentioning single ownership etc. I contacted the seller, and discussed about the scooter a bit, and spoke about the price, and told him that I will get in touch with him and test the scooter when I'm back in Bangalore in a couple of days.

I quickly ran the numberplate on the RTO Parivahan website just to check all things, and it came back to a different name from the seller. But this name was familiar.

This name, I had seen earlier while running some registration numbers of the earlier listings I had seen. So I quickly went through the listing I had seen on Quikr, and it had the same Registration, and same physical numberplate.
But, the seat cover was changed, and the headlight caps were changed to orange.

The Quikr listing was posted 8 days ago, while the OLX listing was posted 7 days ago.
Quikr listing said 10,700km while OLX said 10,900km.

I asked the seller once again if it was single owned, and he confirmed.

I need some advice as to what this could be. This is the first time I'm dealing with purchasing any sort of vehicle on my own, so I just want to be sure.

If you want to take a look at the listings, I will send them to you via PM.",Non-Political

"MS Dhoni is most overrated indian player of all time MS Dhoni got lucky with great indian teammates who won the worldcup. He wasn't best indian team captain but he was captain of best Indian team(at WC winning).He got great cult following who are blind to see anything that looks bad on him so because of that Media sings his great endeavour all Time because criticism him would be bad for business. This why he got so strong in board that he basically do whatever the fuck he likes (you can't ignore some of the team selection which are done after 2011, *Gambhir*). He basically IS team selector and nobody wants to say anything because he is too powerful. Everybody is on his side in board. His performance is shit in last  two years(i think he should have retired somewhere around 2017)but still he makes every single cut. His performance in world cup 2019 is shit but nobody speaking anything because he may retire after worldcup and why risk it all to make a point and become target of internet mob(kudos to Sachin for criticizing him) 

He is gotten to a point where will do anything and get a free pass( just imagine any player doing that tantrums which dhoni  did in IPL when he was losing)

Everybody keep saying that he is so cool but it's rather contrary he basically just don't give a shit. Look at any other captain after losing important match you will find similarly but Dhoni's case you won't. 

It is basically every aspect of his career he do anything that doesn't look good on him people will turn it into a his skill ( i have literally seen video where some people dubbed his voice so it look like he isn't swearing at Manish Pandey ( i get it . people swear all the time and things get competitive in sports, but why sugar coat it to make him larger than life character)


He is great wicket keeper and has a good track record untill 2016. But i think power got in his head.

"I read the Indian economic survey of 2018-9 so you didn't have to. Here are the highlights The biggest take-away was the direct attack on what the survey calls 'Anglo-Saxon economics'. Basically the concept of a general equilibrium theory. Instead it claims an economy is always within either a 'virtous cycle' or a 'vicious cycle'. 

A virtous cycle is characterised by rising investment, rising exports and rising savings. A vicious cycle is the inverse of that. 

The implication is that the government must intervene to steady the ship and any fantasy about 'rational actors' has to be abandoned.

The importance of higher savings cannot be underestimated accoring to the survey. It is only with high and rising savings that a country can **self-finance** high investments. Otherwise it must seek out foreign savings which gets translated into a high current account deficit which in turn makes it vulnerable during times of crises. 


They survey continually made mention of China and other fast-growing East Asian economies when making its case in countless graphs. It is clear what the chief inspiration is. 

Having very high savings naturally means having a correspondingly low domestic consumption. Thus, the only way to have fast growth when domestic consumption is subdued is through fast export growth. They survey made the case that because India still has a low share of world export market so there is plenty of scope to regain, regardless of trade tensions.

The survey made many other recommendations, of which judicial reform is one which caught my one, but the overriding theme of the survey was the call to abandon 'Anglo-Saxon economics', by which it meant general equilibrium theory. 

It'll be interesting to see if India truly makes a decisive economic policy break from the past as the language suggests.",Policy/Economy
"Modi, kejriwal, Hemant soren, sharad pawar, stalin, KCR, Jagan, Mamata, arminder Singh etc etc....... Indian politics is now in a new phase where your 'Party face' matters more than your party or your ideology As the final results trickle in, exit polls have been proven true that a quarter of bjp and Congress voters have switched to 'kejriwal' in Delhi elections. AAP knew that Kejriwal's popular image is their biggest strength and they used it perfectly. From a campaign centered around kejriwal (""lage raho kejriwal"") to posing this question to Delhi voters :**""kejriwal vs who""**.

Gone are the days when a party enjoys blind loyalty just because of past history. As the opposition recovers from 2019 drubbing at hands of modi, it seems that they have realised that any election campaign now requires a strong and popular leader to anchor their campaign.

All the elections in which bjp have been defeated in past few years have one thing in common, the opposition had a strong regional leader

* rajasthan : sachin pilot

* karnataka : siddaramiah (Congress got more votes than bjp)

* Odisha : naveen patnaik

* punjab : captain Amarinder Singh

* maharashtra : sharad pawar (Congress pretty much gave up in maharashtra and didn't even bother campaigning while sharad pawar was doing rallies even in heavy rains)

* Jharkhand : Hemant soren

* telangana : KCR

* Tamil nadu : stalin

* Andra pradesh : Jagan


Indian voters are smart. Political pandits think that the average voter is an idiot who can't distinguish between state and national elections.

In not even a single state election has bjp managed to even come close to their national vote share. People know that modi won't be resigning as PM and coming to their state. Moreover, state elections are fought on different issues and environment than national elections. This was clear in Delhi where while bjp was going on a rampage about shaheen bagh, 50% of the voters didn't even know about it, while the rest didn't understand or care ahout it.

"(CONFESSION) In a Dilemma Alright, this is a follow-up to a post I made a week back regarding me feeling stuck in a job that I really like but also, one that expects me to show up for work all 7 days.

I seem to have trouble giving a link to my first post here as upon posting, I get a message saying that it is awaiting approval. Been trying to do it for a couple of hours and I felt by then, the post would have gotten stale and old to be seen by others, in the feed.

A few days back, while leaving for the day after de-briefing with my boss, he noticed me looking tired than usual (really was dull and tired that day) and told me if there's anything wrong with me. I told him there's nothing wrong but he insisted. Since it's been only 3 months since I joined work, my probation period was coming to an end. I told him that whatever issue that I have, I'll discuss with him during my performance review that would have likely been conducted after the probation got over.

But, he insisted sharing whatever was bothering me and thus, I spilled it out - that a 7 day working schedule is too much for me to handle and that I might not be a fit in this industry (note that I've mentioned ""industry"" and not the ""company"") in the long run (It's a food and beverage industry). I told him a day off in a week is all I expect. For which, he told me that he is fine with me taking a break every week as long as I don't take it on a Sunday, as the production team too, will start demanding days-off.

I guess, it is kinda reasonable but still, I find it odd that there's no day-off by default and that I have to take one from my part. But that's kinda resolved, right? Except this isn't the problem.....

When he inquired me as to what my long-term goals are, I told him (and have told him prior, even on my interview) that my endgame is to become a professor in the field of Humanities or a psychologist. He kinda dismissed that desire of mine and told me flat-out that I am not a ""professor material"" as I am shy, reserved and socially awkward who lacks people skills. He told me that the role that I am in, right now, is what I was made to do due to how good and ""exemplary"" I have been, in these three months it seems.

He broke down in detail and gave (what I feel) was a worst-case estimate as to how my desire won't work out for me and told me that he too was in my place when he was my age - confused and ""lacking a sense of direction"" and told me as to how he earned this place due to sheer hard work and asked me data to back-up my claim of becoming a teacher, when I told him my desire was purely based on intuition (he told me to not ""hide behind such a pretext"").

Honestly, I felt humiliated, insulted and destroyed after the conversation. This is the first time someone is telling me that I am not a professor material. As, based on previous interactions with some of my classmates, friends and even my teachers, almost everyone agreed that I have what it took to become one. But, boss was a highly educated guy who has had tons of XP with life and is sitting in this position out of his sheer hard work and dedication and so, he implied that by not taking his advice, I am losing a great opportunity and going on a path in ruining my life.

I felt so patronized and the entire conversation reeked of condescension, from his part. I literally could not tell anything from my defense and told him that I'll prove him wrong somehow.

Tbh, I never even told that I was planning on quitting....all I said was that the schedule was too much for me and so, I'll give a few more months only after which, I might call ""quits"". He told me to quit asap if that was the case, as he does not wish to invest and spend any further on me as it was go to waste, once I quit and thus, he'll have to find another one and have to start the entire thing from scratch all over again. Which is very understandable and fair, as I never thought about it from that perspective.

Honestly though, I did not know quitting a job will be this emotionally draining and intensive. I thought it would be cold, formal process but no....they patronized, guilt-tripped me and made me feel absolutely terrible and worthless.

He has given me two days time to come to a conclusion and based on what I wrote in my previous post, I am still stumped and at a loss in taking a decision based on the perks and privileges I enjoy here. But the whole interaction has left me with a bad taste in my mouth - no one patronizes me and dictates me into telling what I should be and what I cannot be and insult, mock and belittle my desires and dreams under the pretext of being ""honest, rational and practical"".

Maybe my desires are impractical but, it could have been broken down to me in a better way.

"What else can I career in apart from engineering? Hi all!

Over the past few years, I have become very jaded with computer science and engineering. Everytime I sit down to code for a job or assignment it feels like a meaningless task to me.  As a result, I find it tedious and I am not able to put in any effort that amounts to original work or learning. Computers have become boring to me! Moreover, I have developed cervical pain and think that I cant continue a career that requires me to sit in front of the computer all the time.

On the other hand, I have become more and more interested in the wider currents of the world covered in the social sciences like political economy or philosophy. Issues such as the impacts of technology, social organisation, policy,etc seem more important to me than the next great programming language or the iphone.

I am also interested in moving out of the country for reasons mentioned here - https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/77z7a8/which_country_for_masters_and_further_job/

So, keeping all this in mind, what career can I move towards? Where can I train for it and which country would be a good choice to pursue it?

"Unpopular Opinion: The future of India's clean energy Hybrids and EVs looks bleak to me I know the Govt. has been pushing to increase EVs' penetration in India substantially as soon as possible because our air quality has become easily the world's most polluted, but given the state of things, both politically and technologically, it seems like an impossible task right now.

Nitin Gadkari said earlier last year,

&gt; “There is no need for any policy now. The electric vehicle (EV) standards finalized by Niti Aayog will be used as final benchmark.”

Vice Chairman of Niti Ayog:

&gt; “We need a policy to put it all together (charging infrastructure, battery swapping) and we can’t just have people running around on their own and ministries working in silos.""

Piyush Goyal, now the Minister of Coal and railways stated that the Prime Minister had constituted a core group of senior ministers to “lead the initiative and make sure that by 2030, most, if not all, vehicles in India are powered by electricity.”

He himself was rebutted by his colleague, Babul Supriyo, when he responded with a written reply in Lok Sabha that there was no deadline specified and his ministry of heavy industries &amp; public enterprises was given no timeframe for 100% electric mobility.

All of these contradictory statements by different departments of the Government has thrown the entire automobile sector in a state of confusion. Are we going to do it? Are we not going to do it? What are the exact goals? Because the goals, as specified by Piyush Goyal, are delusional at best and you cannot magically convert **most** Indian vehicles plying on the road today into electrical vehicles by 2030. It doesn't take one to be a CEO of one of the leading automobile manufacturing companies to see that.

Apart from that, most of India's electricity comes from burning fossil fuel. It's not clean energy. So what are we even fighting for? That would just mean that implementation of these schemes coercing people to buy EVs would only move the pollution off city roads to its hinterlands, where that power is generated.

Let's talk about FAME II now- As MD, Bajaj Auto, Rajiv Bajaj, put it, ""They're putting the cart before the horse."" As in, seeking to accelerate manufacturing in India without ensuring there is adequate demand for the electric and hybrid vehicles so produced. Only buses priced up to ₹2 crore, strong and plug-in hybrids under ₹15 lakh, three-wheelers under ₹5 lakh and two-wheelers under ₹1.5 lakh will be eligible for incentives. In face of the potential and present dire consequences, India should be doing even better than US and Norway and go out of it's way to incentivize EVERY GODDAMN Hybrid and EV under the sun (pun intended). Every single one of them. Western countries aren't making their citizens breathe air that is multiple times more dangerous than recommended for a normal human to intake and they still offer more generous subsidies and invest tons more in awareness programs for the same.

FAME II will also offer incentives to manufacturers, who invest in developing electric vehicles and its components, including lithium-ion batteries and electric motors since developing li-ion batteries (used both in EVs and PHEVs) are very expensive to manufacture in India because lithium is not produced in India. On the other hand, China produces batteries en-masse but the citizens and their representatives in the houses today are more concerned about China getting India's balls in a vice over it's over-reliance on China for it's automobile sector's crucial driving force (quite literally) than coughing their lungs out. Needless to say, PRIORITIES ARE FLAWED.

I do not understand why Hybrids are so far out of the reach of the average Indian buyer today, even though that tech came to India way before EVs. As explained above, EVs are still too costly to produce in India because of lack of local lithium production, are impractical to buy with a purpose of making the air cleaner because India burns fossil fuels anyways to produce most of it's electricity and no feasible charging network exists even in most metropolitan cities for anyone to even consider it as an incentive to buy these vehicles. In that case, a typical middle-class person concerned about environment would be left with only Hybrids for options. But if you do some research, it seems almost no attractive options other than a Maruti Ciaz are available for him/her out in the market to buy a Hybrid. Hybrids are way more fuel efficient and less-polluting than your normal IC engines. FAME II is also known to offer incentives on them. So why is that? They don't even need specialized charging stations like EVs so it's beyond me why manufacturers have forsaken them. Maybe it has something to do with the worldwide trend of moving to SUVs as the most popular choice of transportation, offered even to the lower-tier customer base.

So to summarize, the Government doesn't really know what it wants or what it's doing apart from the end goal and an all-over-the-place FAME scheme it has no idea how to execute, that confuses the automobile manufacturers and they're not bringing their EVs into the Indian market as they see working on complying to BS VI norms as the safest bet right now, India's tendency to burn fossil fuels to generate electricity and old, outdated grids that eliminate all possibility of setting up government-endorsed at-home chargers, slow development of public fast chargers due to lack of manufacturers' interest in introducing EVs (or introducing affordable Hybrids even, for that matter), government's ""selective"" incentives on EVs and hybrids causing the rich, who are usually at the forefront of all new automobile tech introduced in a country and become the trendsetters, to look at IC engine vehicles as better alternatives and lack of local lithium production despite incentives.

No wonder India's not making any strides in it's overly-ambitious but poorly implemented goals for cleaner air.

Reasonable thoughts and discussions are welcome. On the other hand, if you have an overly-optimistic, dreamy-eyed opinion which has nothing to do with ground reality or logic in general, you can kindly go hang.",Policy/Economy

We have all been moaning about this problem since decades but nobody has done anything about it. Congress is criticizing this move now but why didn't they do anything in the ten long years they had?

From Pakistan's perspective, I don't see why are they making so much noise about Kashmir? Why can't they apply the Punjab model here too - just as Punjab is divided into Pakistani and Indian Punjab, why can't the same be applied to Kashmir too? Its a peaceful and least resistance path in the present circumstances.

Asking the citizens (plebiscite) is a wrong idea according to me because this will send a very wrong message to the integrity of our nation. Any state tomorrow will come with the idea of becoming a separate country in the name of plebiscite. Even strategically, J&amp;K becoming a country is out of question as it will be surrounded by super powers on all the sides.

"This is massive! India wins 368 medals at Special Olympics Summer Games! Kudos! In one of the best sports performances in Indian history, Indian team of 284 athletes have clinched 368 medals at the prestigious Special Olympics World Summer Games held at Abu Dhabi between Mar 14 to 21.

Here's the mind-blowing overall medal tally:

- Gold : 85
- Silver : 154
- Bronze : 129

I had posted a just few days ago on how investing heavily in only a handful of ""profitable talents"" viz. dance, singing, comedy and cricket; and media's blatant neglect of other talents might discourage talented individuals from pursuing their interests in other fields of sports and art. 

And today I read about these champions of indomitable determination. They proved how, despite their hardships, special abilities and limited support, one can make history. One must also applaud their parents and well wishers for truly believing in their children when the world generally looks down upon people with special needs & abilities.

Most of these sports persons will soon return to their normal lives full of obstacles. I only hope that these men & women of passion get as much support and nurturing as possible from the govt as well as the society. They made India proud. They deserve to be rewarded and rewarded well for bringing glory to the nation. And more importantly for bringing a ray of hope in the lives of millions of others.

[Their homecoming pictures are the best thing I've seen today.](http://www.newindianexpress.com/galleries/sport/2019/mar/24/special-olympics-indias-medal-winners-return-home-amidst-glitzy-and-glory-102173.html)

These are the smiles that deserved extensive coverage in the media. They deserved interviews. Their stories deserved to be told. They have the potential to inspire and change lives. But, alas, hardly did we even realize that such an incredible feat was even accomplished in India.

"Need advice regarding a new job offer I just got a job offer from a leading health care organization in Bangalore. My current organisation has offered me an option to relocate to their Germany office. I am currently working in their Mumbai office for the past three and a half year. I am in a bit of a dilemma to pick my options. 

The points I am pondering over are these.

*  Whereas my current organisation is a Germany based small sized company (some 50-60 people overall), the organisation that has offered me a position is a global MNC.
* Bangalore and Munich provide completely different life styles and comforts. 
* Professionally, for the prospective organisation, I get experience of working in a large organization, which currently I lack. On the other hand, in my current organisation, I'd get the opportunity to work in a culturally different environment. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know that accepting a counter offer is always not advised. The reason i am planning to switch is to gain experience in terms of how things work outside my current organization (both in terms of technology as well as processes), and also in terms of personal change in environment (a different lifestyle)

As I said, i am in a bit of a dilemma and am looking for a different perspective(s) to view this situation.",AskIndia

"Interesting perspective of Sacred Games from the commercial cinema lovers angle... but are they really right? I was surprised (and curious) about the numbers behind Kabir Singh's commercial success and stumbled upon this page while googling stuff. Have a look at the question asked [here](https://boxofficeindia.com/report-details.php?articleid=5202) and the answer of BoxOfficeIndia editors on Sacred Games' popularity (or lack of it). Just highlighting some of the things they say:  

&amp;#x200B;

*Q: Sacred Games is having a second part despite it being very bad and practically unwatchable...*

*A: India does not patronize this sort of stuff and* ***Netflix audience in India*** ***watches foreign programs not the sub standard Indian stuff***.....Netflix knows what is going to grow subscriber base and its not Sacred Games for sure. Its ***actual very good this sort of rubbish like Sacred Games goes to digital*** *otherwise we would have to bear toned down versions in cinemas. ......This is just a second part there could be another one but eventually when its not working it will die.....Sacred Games is like the Sahib Biwi Aur Gangster of digital as that film had three parts despite no one really watching any of the films. Of course it* ***may be talked well off but what comes out of the mouth and actually having watchers is two different things.***  

&amp;#x200B;

Now I have heard that the website is a key source to assess commercial performances of movies and I also understand that maybe Sacred Games doesn't qualify as commercial success but I am genuinely curious who are these people, and have they literally been living in caves not to acknowledge the fact that this is the content a lot of us liked and want.... Or am I wrong?",AskIndia

"Ashis Nandy : A remarkable Indian political psychologist, social theorist, and critic. > Nandy has provided theoretical critiques of European colonialism development, modernity, secularism, Hindutva, science, technology, nuclearism, cosmopolitanism, and utopia. He has also offered alternative conceptions relating to cosmopolitanism and critical traditionalism. In addition to the above, Nandy has offered an original historical profile of India's commercial cinema as well as critiques of state and violence.

>""During the dispute over Babri Masjid, Ashis Nandy, a prominent Indian intellectual, began a series of interviews with R.S.S. members. A trained psychologist, he wanted to study the mentality of the rising Hindu nationalists. One of those he met was Narendra Modi, who was then a little-known B.J.P. functionary. Nandy interviewed Modi for several hours, and came away shaken. His subject, Nandy told me, exhibited all the traits of an authoritarian personality: puritanical rigidity, a constricted emotional life, fear of his own passions, and an enormous ego that protected a gnawing insecurity. During the interview, Modi elaborated a fantastical theory of how India was the target of a global conspiracy, in which every Muslim in the country was likely complicit. “Modi was a fascist in every sense,” Nandy said. “I don’t mean this as a term of abuse. It’s a diagnostic category.”

"A way out, hopefully TLDR: just want to run away from family, asking for help with a job before I do


Hey guys,
So I see a lot posts about someone being in depression and aren't sure what to do and seeking help. This is probably similar if not same.

About me, am 29 year old dude without any idea of what passion is or what kind of career I want to have. I have the most self absorbed parents who literally made every decision for me all the time. Hence, here I stand without a single clue on what I want to do and with marriage and constant pressure of joining the family business thrown at me everyday.

I am now forced into an internship in a foreign land where I am literally learning nothing about the nature of my family business nor anything on general that will give me confidence that I can be a part of said business. (I have tried to do self studies and online courses on supply chain, which is what the business is based and I honestly don't find it interesting)

Am I depressed? Possibly. Am I suicidal? Maybe. Everytime I don't have a distraction in front of me all I think of is to kill myself and just stop this shithole of life. I don't have a lot of friends, am sort of awkward around people and largely I don't have anything that is me anymore, I doubt and analyse everything that I do or like to figure out if I actually like it, or if I am used it.

I Know a lot of you will say, ""man just take a stand and do what you want, you are 29""; which is valid, I don't know why but I have never been a ""take a stand kind of person"" , plus it's not like my parents are abusive physically that I wanted to run away or something. It was just I hoped I could make them understand, but they never have and I think with the way things are going, they never will.

Coming to why am writing this, look I know it's a lot to ask for and I don't know if it's allowed either, am done man, I know if I don't run away now, I won't last this year, I feel it(bit cringey but I actually do), I was hoping to put myself out there if anybody is listening/reading and ask for a job. Am ready at this point to do anything, I'll work as anything, I don't mind salary, level or whatever.(I only have one request that it's as far from Bangalore as possible)

I have experience but I just couldn't get jobs for the last few months because I was either clueless on what to apply or my crippling low self confidence. 

If anyone is interested, I have worked in a startup for a couple of years and I know sql and some basic analytics. I have been told am a quick learner so I guess am totally not useless.

I really want to runaway, but I just need a job or something that keeps me busy, I know there are delivery jobs or I can just find something anywhere, I don't know of it makes sense, I guess the assurance of a job gives me the confidence to take that step.

If anyone wants to talk, please dm me, and I'll give my resume if you think am a good fit anywhere.(I know asking a lot, and I don't know what else to do at this moment). Other than that, just thanks for hearing me out I guess",Non-Political

"It is the Left that is leading the Anti-CAA Movement, while the Liberals are trying to seize it. It is the Left that is leading the movement against CAA. From Jadavpur University to JNU, from Bengal to Kerela, it is the left that is on the streets. Kerela, as you know, was the first state to refuse implementation of the bill. They are now also the first state to go to Supreme Court against any Central govt law, for the first time in history.

In Bengal too, the Left Front parties were the first who started to protest against CAA (started since October 2019 against NRC). They were the first to protest against NPR and threatened to destroy detention centres if they are built forcibly. The bourgeois media (imcliding the likes of NDTV) focuses on TMC whose leaders have no problem meeting with the PM and continue the work of NPR, despite protests. They refuse to create a national front against CAA.

Left Front parties was the first alliance which sent letters to all the CMs requesting to not implement the CAA.  Despite potential risks of their only govt (Kerela) to be banished.

The Congress is uninterested in leading any serious movement against CAA. All they do is call some half-hearted meetings that no one attends. The states with Congress govt do not play a frontal role to lead the protests in their states.

The Right understands this well. You don't see Liberal organisations being attacked. It is the Left orgainsations and unions that are being attacked by the Right.

Still, the Liberal organisations are acting as if they are the one doing all work. Liberalism is the political wing of capitalism. It inherently leans rightward (since going left is opposing capitalism). Their enlightened centrist attitude (""both sides are wrong dude"") will never be able to remove the breeding grounds of fascism (which is capitalism). If we let Liberals act as if they are the saviours of India, fascism may eventually fall due to powerful protests, but its origin factors will never reduce. Neoliberalism will continue and eventually give rise to Fascism once more.",CAA-NRC-NPR

"[serious] Can someone please suggest me a way to solve issue with my passport application being rejected I don't know if this is the right place to ask these kind of questions, please remove this if it's in the wrong subreddit.


### So this is my situation


I on the last round of interview for an Irish company. And I don't have a passport yet ( I know it's dumb ). So I applied for the passport and went to the passport office today and my application got rejected due to the lack of identification documents.

I went there with 3 docs. Aadhar, pan And my sslc certificate.
I only have Aadhar, and pan card as identification docs. ( I have voters ID but the name in there is spelled wrong ). So the mam at the counter told me if there is any other documents I have, and suggested that I can get a online birth certificate. So I went to the near by Cafe and took a print out of the birth certificate. 

But in that, my name was given with out my initials. So the Assistant Passport officer rejected my application. 


So when I went back to ask what else I can do . The mam at the counter told me that if I applied for non tatkal passport I will need only two identification documents ( plus sslc certificate ). 

So I came back home and went to nearest *E-seva Kendra* to reapply for the passport in  non tatkal way.

## problem 2

Imagine my name is *Michael Jackson Obama*

So in my sslc certificate my name is written as *Michael JO.* And in my Aadhar and pan card it's written as *Michael Jackson Obama* . So he says that I cannot apply passport like this. I have to change my name in the sslc certificate to match my Aadhar. 

*Q1:* But the passport officer didn't mention any of these. Is that. Problem ? 

Changing my name in my sslc could take up to a couple of weeks. But if it takes that long I could lose my job.

I currently don't have licence. 

*Q2:* what are my options for getting a passport ASAP. ?


**Edit :- 10/03/2020**

I went to meet my uncle's friend who has some knowledge on these things. 

So I have been told that there will be no problem for me to apply passport via non tatkal route. 
Since my name on the PAN card and Aadhar is just expanded form of my name in the sslc certificate. So that won't be a problem. Appointment for the passport office has been scheduled at 16th March so I will post what happens next.


**Edit :- 16/04/2020**

I finished the interview in the passport office with out any trouble. They asked me which name I want in my passport. **Michael JO** or **Michael Jackson Obama**. So the whole process was over under 45mins. So waiting for police verification now.",Scheduled

"Indo-Pak relations, diplomacy and the people - some food for thought Incoming Rant!

Our opinion regarding our neighbors differ widely depending on what kind of political ideology we hold, and its probably the same on that side of the border too.

I'm going to take a neutral view on this, the world isn't exactly black and white. The extreme hindu nationalist view that every Paki is like a Burhan Wani or Hafiz Saeed is obviously very wrong. But equally wrong is the view of every pseudo leftist that they are like innocent kids holding lollipops! They aren't as bad as portrayed in movies like Gadar and Border, but they aren't as good as portrayed in Razee or Haider also. The truth is always somewhere in the middle or center.

Common sense tells me that most of them are just individuals like us who want to be happy in life. We aren't exactly good friends but we interact a lot culturally, our artists travel there and they come here. Looking at this positively, we are pretty much moving towards a European Union like situation, though we aren't exactly there yet. We get along well generally speaking, except when it comes to KASHMIR!

Now coming to that, let's take a simple house analogy. There are two families living in a single large house separated by a border going through, one family is called IN and another called PK. Each family gets along well with the other, some members move to the other side every now and then and chat with them through internet too.

Now imagine there is this schizophrenic child called KASHMIR who is throwing a lot of tantrums! This kid isn't able to decide whether it wants to move towards one family or the other (or may be it doesn't even want to live in that house but wants ""azadi"" from it!). Both of the families are emotionally attached to this kid and want it to come to their side. While the families usually get along well, they resort to verbal abuses and even fights when the question comes of taking custody of this kid!

I say why both families are spending 90% of their energies on this useless kid when they have more serious problems to deal with? Let them keep the existing relations they have with that kid (namely PoK and IoK from each family's perspective) and simply move on? Forget taking complete custody of that kid and move on with your lives. Let the kid throw all kinds of tantrums, don't listen to it. Both families' peace and prosperity is far more important than this one single kid. So, I say forget all about this kid and simply move on in life? What ya say?",AskIndia

"Placement Season: Off Campus Placement Hey guys, as the placement season has started and many companies have already started hiring freshers through on campus placement drive, I would like to get information about companies that are hiring off campus as well. 
My college has a rule that once you get an offer from a company, you can only apply for some other company if it offering 2 times more than your current offers. (If you get an offer of 5LPA from Company A, you can only apply to company B if it offering more than 10LPA).
Due to this rule, I am not able to apply to a lot of companies. 
So how to get to know about the off campus drive of various companies, is there any particular resource where such things are updated? Or has anyone gone through off campus placement?

"Drinking hot water, avoiding cold foods - prep for the virus This is a question for the doctors of this subreddit or anyone who can answer it with any kind of authority. Personal anecdotes won't really help me much.

So every Indian parent has always been a strong advocate of drinking warm water or hot water and all kinds of other shit like milk with turmeric or gargling regularly even before the virus. But now they have more ammunition. Now you have to do these things if you want to beat the virus. I also want to include vitamin C tablets to the purview of this question as ""they boost immunity"". 

I'm not going to argue against whatever health benefits these things might have normally. I'm sure they're great. But my dad has a whatsapp recording of some guy who has a friend in China (idfk as if that claim makes the recording more authentic) where the guy goes through a list of things to help you prep against the virus. 

He makes a case for how warm water doesn't let mucus collect and takes it to your stomach where gastric acids deal w it. And says to avoid cold foods during these times. Alnd take vit C. And gargle regularly.

I guess my question how exactly do these things help against the virus, if at all?  And if they don't how do I convince my parents to calm down?

I also want to add the reason for my cynicism is I've heard doctors say that you can try supplements for improving immunity but nothing can really help you from getting the virus. And don't cold foods only worsen the symptoms of an existing cold virus instead of causing it? No one is implying eating ice cream will give you corona but their implication is that eating cold foods will make you weak against corona. I hope I can get a definite answer out of this that I can carry around for the rest of my life.",Food

Why doesn’t India have more olympic medals or elite athletes I’m just curious a question coming from an american paki whose never been back to his home country. Let’s just say for arguments sake Indians are not genetically athletic however in a sample size of 1.3 billion people you are going to have very large statistical outliers (I also don’t think Indians are not genetically inferior especially north Indians) but why haven’t they been found. China has 2 billion people and has made the most with them.They currently have track runners running 100m times in 9.8s which is enough to medal if not even win the next olympics even if Chinese are not “athletic” in a large sample size there will be elite athletes. So why haven’t they been found in India. China also wins the second most medals and have also produces players in basketball. I’m just curious why this is with the population size.,Sports
"[Guide] Building your resume while in college as a CS Engineering student - Personal Projects [Part 2 / 4] If you are in first year of engineering, I highly suggest you read [Part One](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c87jbg/guide_building_your_resume_while_in_college_as_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) here before coming to part 2.

Post part 1, you should have acquired three main skills

* You must know one programming language with medium-to-expert proficiency
* You must have a rough idea of what Object Oriented Programming languages is and what Object Oriented Design is. Its an added bonus if you have worked with an OOP language like Java / C++
* You must have built something small, learned how to debug / write basic test cases.

A great addition that /u/esotericaniket added was the ability to read code. As they advised, you could pickup Github repos that are at the same skill level as you and start reading code. If that code makes sense to you, you've made great progress. If it doesn't, adapt, improvise, overcome.

This post will target someone who is in the second year of engineering.  Now, if you followed the first post closely, you would have a list of clubs in your college handy. There are two scenarios :

1. Your college does not have clubs.
2. Your college has average clubs
3. Your college has good clubs

I will elaborate on all three scenarios and help you take your learning forward. As usual, I am open to any addition / changes.

**Scenario 1 :** Your college does not have clubs

No issues, a lot of colleges do not have clubs. In this case, I'd recommend continuing your learning experience by building a little bigger thing or getting an industry internship.

**1.1 Build something people can use**

When it comes to building something, this isn't similar to how you built something in the previous post. Your focus here should be to solve a real world problem and something that attracts / helps at least 10 users. Say, you don't know what to do in the weekend. You can work with the Zomato API and make an app that will choose a random restaurant and recommend it to you. You can also add other APIs that will generate a list of things that you can do. This is just an example, but you see how you can find people using this kind of a thing? I hope you do.

You will have to spend sometime analyzing the problem around you first and how you can solve the problem.

So, the obvious question comes:

**1.1.1 How can I find a problem and how do I analyze a problem?**

Start small. Don't think about saving the world, think about saving your friends. Try to figure out a part in your life that can be automated or a small feature that might help make your life better. This doesn't have to be a disrupting solution. If you find such a problem/solution, good. If you don't, pickup an already solved problem and solve it your way. I will elaborate on this later. While thinking about the problem, do not think about code / technologies / solutions / effort. Just focus on the problem. No matter how big the problem is, we will see how to tackle it later.

**Finding a problem -&gt; Finding a solution -&gt; Designing a solution -&gt; Implementing -&gt; Testing is an iterative cycle.**

**1.1.1.1** **Solving a New Problem**

Here, I am assuming you have found a new problem. If you haven't, skip to the next section. Once you have a problem in hand, analyze if the problem really needs a solution or its okay. Take an example of a hostel where every floor has only 2 washrooms and availability becoming an issue is your problem. If you decide to solve this by building an application to mark washrooms as vacant or not / book the washroom, it might not be an ideal thing because its a headache to use. If you say you will add a device that will track occupancy of the washroom and automatically device a queue based system on first-come-first-serve basis based on request, it will again be an overkill as the person in need of the washroom might as well just go wait outside instead use your solution.

So, once you establish that your problem does require a solution, try to think about a solution. Again, at this point, don't think about HOW you will implement the solution. Don't think about the programming language, framework, etc. Just think of the solution. I will take the same example of having an application that will tell you a random thing to do in the weekend. Think about how one would go about this problem currently. The steps they'd take is probably something like :

1. Visit websites about restaurants, pubs, events, cinemas and theater.
2. Filter by date, nearness and other criteria
3. Book.

Your goal has to be automate 1 and 2 by building this app. Identify a few sources that have free to use APIs that help you do 1 and 2 and now you have the basic solution in mind.

**1.1.1.2** **Solving an existing problem**

Did you not find any problem that you could solve? No issues, it does happen. Now start taking a problem that is already solved. Make an app that's already there or solve a problem that is already solved, but all by yourself without referring the solution. A simple problem would be money management. You can make an application that will help you manage your money. There are 10 thousand apps that help you manage your money, so why should you do one? A simple answer is because you did not build the other 10 thousand apps, so this app will be YOURS truly.

**1.1.2 Solution Description**

You now have a problem at hand. Now think about the solution. Make a list that describes your solution and the features that your solution has, what will be the mode of access (Mobile App / Web App / Command Line Interface / API) and some thinking points that you want to note while implementing the solution. Be sure to document all of these if possible, maybe in very simple terms.

**1.1.3 Implementation**

**1.1.3.1 What will I use?**

Now, personally I have been a fan of learning by doing. So, I would suggest you spend a couple of hours in looking up what suits your need the best and what can be easily learned. Both these things are very important. For example, if I want to make a Money Management application, I can definitely start learning Java and build a native Android App. But is that what will be ideal? Is there a way I can expose this application to multiple platforms? Or make it platform independent? We will have to think of our users to come to this conclusion.

As an other example, if your idea is to track a Git repository and send a notification when there is an issue raised in that repo, an application might not be the best way. A telegram / Whatsapp / email bot might be ideal there. So, do your research

Also identify if you can use any APIs or existing service instead of re-inventing the wheel.

Document these.

**1.1.3.2 How do I begin?**

Now that you know what to use, the next question is how to begin. The way I would start is usually cloning the Hello World application of the the framework/language that I have chosen and use that as a starting point to write on top of. This MAY not be the right way, but it has worked for me.

Its totally okay to clone a project and make changes to it. But, if you want to not do this, the other way is to set everything up from scratch. I strongly recommend referring to the official documentation at some point in your coding life cycle. (The earlier, the better).

Whatever you do, remember to put it on Git(hub/lab). Have a Readme file that describes your idea and commit your changes regularly. If you don't know how git works, take some time to understand that. (Maybe thats an interesting topic to cover in the future?)

**Scenario 2 :** Your college has average clubs

Now, in this case you can either give up and follow the Scenario 1 route or do some analysis on why these clubs are average. Mostly (and this is ONLY from my experience), a lot of clubs have good ideas with busy/technically challenged mentors. I've seen good mentors have good ideas and still would want to do things the old way wasting a lot of time in documentation where they expect you to document the code even before you begin coding, instead of prototyping and then documenting. Both have their fair share of pros and cons, but I think today's generation would rather have a proof of concept than have gazillion documents which describe every small aspect of the idea.

If your professors or mentors aren't upto the mark, resistant to change and micromanage projects, I would sincerely advice you to not pursue this. Having said that, I would advice you to give it a try temporarily to see if you can change things. Set a deadline in your mind, say, 1 month. If you don't have anything proper to show in a month, quit and start your learning on your own.

**Scenario 3 :** Your college has good clubs

In this case, pick a good project. Preferably something that you can complete. A good set of projects to pick would be something that has already been started and you can see yourself completing it. The next best thing would be to work on a project that is still in the idea phase. 

When you pick a project, don't just pick it because it has a lot of buzz words. Think about the project, do your homework, check if there are existing projects that do the same thing and then validate how you are going to be better than the existing project. Basically, you will need to believe that the problem you are solving is worth solving and/or can be solved in a stipulated time. 

You spending time writing an application that will digitalize attendance in your college is much better than trying to write ML models to do some task that you don't believe in and have no idea about.

Stay in good touch with your guide. Meet them regularly, update them with your progress, your learning, roadblocks and deadlines. Your end goal should be to get an internship certificate and a letter of recommendation from your mentor.

Preferably, log the work you have done everyday and aim to do better than you did on the previous day. If possible, use Git to put your code online!

I am sorry for the delay in the post and for giving very less importance to Scenario 2 and 3. I will be taking any kind of questions in the comment box. I might be late in replying because I am currently busy with work. But I will definitely reply to you.

Also, if you feel you are stuck in a hellhole, are lost and have no way of coming out of this mess that is engineering and coding, please do DM me and we can schedule some time to have a chat! I will definitely try to help you out.

My next post will be about Internships in your 3rd year, how to get them, how to leverage your learning, how to choose good internships, face interviews, etc! A lot of writing might go into that, so I can't promise you a deadline. But I will try to keep it before the second week of August. :)

"[np] [askindia] Need a complete guide to starting on your own in the IT industry - freelancing, OPC, LLP. this comes from the many questions I see here which further give rise to may more in my mind.

I have been reading on many websites and trying to find out the processes, terminology and what not - just to be stuck in reading but not doing anything.

Randian's who have managed to and/or doing it on there own, please put in your experiences and guides to do the needful.

I'd like to stress here that though the process is considered simpler now, it seems far too bureaucratic  for a IT simpleton like me. From what I have read and understood:

* LLP or Private Limited are better than OPC (why?)
* LLP or PL need 3 people, while OPC needs one and one for nomination
* register company, get some secure USB token
* register trade marks (but no idea how to register different company names and products - like One97 and Paytm) for apt classes (35 to 45) or in all of them
* dedicated Office : needed or not?
* GST, VAT, etc :  what's needed and when?

And then there is freelancing and creating your own product - for which what and what not's are not clear anywhere. because presumably you'd need trademark and stuff there too and you also need TAN and PAN and DIN and current accounts and etc.

What I am interested in creating my web based product, and deploying it and making money. problem is I don't know if it is actually that simple.

So I don't want to make it about myself. I'd like this to be for others too who might want to seek up similar help or who'd step on this path in future.

Please, help and post your knowledge and experiences.
