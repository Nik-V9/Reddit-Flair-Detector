 Just wanted to know was this a Flipkart exclusive product. Or it will be available in market soon ? Went out of stock by the time I noticed it. Wanted to try primarily because of that nice looking colour gradient and all in one approach.

I don't think it will work. Because the ads make no sense.

The ads are made in a way, it looks like that condoms are sex enhancers. They give more pleasure. Where the opposite is true. Also that's not the purpose of the condom anyway.

Condoms are not sexy. Condom ads should not be sexy either. It should contain an old white haired wise looking doctor (to get the attention of the parents) where he tells the actual job of the condom and why it is important. We don't need Sunny Leone twerking on the beach with a strawberry in her hands.

I think only then it will work.",cqptl5,,false,/r/india/comments/cqptl5/indian_condom_ads_and_why_they_wont_work/,Food

4) While the water is boiling, add the Maggi cluster(s) - I can't think of any other word
5) Cook for 2 mins - not any more!
6) Pour out the excess amount of water ( leave some in though, depending on how you like it )
7) Add the masala, mix well, cover the pan and cook on low heat for 2 mins
8) Enjoy

1564732631,reva_r,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cl14wj/delhi_style_authentic_butter_chicken_recipe/,6,19,,,Delhi style authentic Butter Chicken recipe,"Delhi style Butter Chicken, very close to what you get at Moti Mahal, the inventor of Butter Chicken.

The Delhi style Butter chicken is all about generosity. You need a gravy that's creamy, not oily or greasy. And it's a very heavy dish, reserved for special occasions. 

&gt;Step 1: The Chicken.

First, let's make the chicken. Traditionally, Tandoori Chicken is used but since it's not possible to make it at home, let's make something close. 
Take 500 grams of chicken  boneless or with bones. 
Add lime juice, salt and marinate for 30 mins. 

After 30 mins, squeeze off excess water from the chicken and add kashmiri red chilli, tandoori masala, 2 tsp of mustard oil and leave it to marinate for 1 hour. 

Now cook the chicken by placing it on a hot pan. Do not flip it constantly. Let it cook for 10 mins on each side. It takes about 30-35 mins to get fully cooked. 
Once the chicken is cooked, keep it aside. 

&gt;Step 2: The Gravy

Gravy is the most important thing. For this, take 4 tomatoes and throw in a pressure cooker for 4 whistles. 
Now puree the tomatoes and run them through a sieve. 

Now cook the filtered tomato puree in a non stick pan for 30-40 mins. Keep adding water if it goes too dry. 

Now your gravy and chicken are done. 

&gt;Step 3: Butter Chicken. 

Now it's time to combine and make butter chicken. 

Just  before you want to eat, in a hot pan, add your tomato gravy. Now add some chilli powder, two green chillies, salt and stir. Taste and adjust salt as needed. Now add the chicken. 

Notice how we haven't added any butter or oil till now to the gravy? That's because it's crucial not to add the butter and cream until the very end. 

Now it's time to add a good amount of butter For a typical serving, I suggest 40 grams of butter. 

Once the butter has melted, add 150 ml of fresh, low-fat cream. (I use amul). 
Butter chicken gravy is 40% tomatoes and 60% butter and cream. 

Mix it all together and immediately turn off the flame. 
Before serving, add some Kasuri Methi to finish off. 

Follow these steps and you'll get Butter Chicken that tastes exactly like Delhi Butter Chicken.",cl14wj,,false,/r/india/comments/cl14wj/delhi_style_authentic_butter_chicken_recipe/,Food

1565550548,loneguy_,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cp0vw1/masala_box_review/,7,7,,,Masala Box Review,"Hi All,

I tried Masala Box for 5 days. North Indian Veg for Dinner. I stay in Mahadevpura around 2-3km from Bagamane World Technology Center. Now I subscribed through the app for the classic North Indian Veg dinner.

I am just letting everyone else know of my experience:-

The food arrived at around 8-9pm on all days, I didn't ask for a specific time nor did they, not sure if you can specify the time of delivery.

The delivery guy has a ton of parcels so you have to go get it, no door delivery :(

The food comes neatly packaged in a plastic container with 2 compartments for Daal, Sabji, 2 Chapatis &amp; Rice or Just Rice(1 day only), Raita, Salad, pickle. (If you choose South Indian you get curd, I didn't find any option to change from Raita to curd in the app)

Now the food seemed healthy with Salad **BUT the food was COLD** like always cold cold, never warm never ever. The Masala Box Customer care people requested for feedback the next day I informed them regarding my suggestion of using traditional steal dabbas rather than the throwaway plastic and also **please deliver the food hot**

And for the remaining 4 days, I ate the cold cold food. I have no idea if the food can be reheated in a microwave in the plastic throwaway plate/container they give.

Considering the price you pay I really want my food hot. For people thinking of going for masala box please go for the 5 days meal to see if it's going to work out for you.

For me, it just didn't workout...

EDIT:

Forgot the most important bit, not sure if I am a heavy eater or something but the food quantity was not sufficient as well. 2 chapatis and rice they provided was okay for me, I won't say was sufficient or more than enough, not sure about others.

EDIT:

By **Salad** I mean some carrots+cucumber or onion+radish or watermelon+cucumber pieces in a small box, please don't misunderstand it for the fancy salads with dozens of sauces/dressings

The amount I paid for 5 days was Rs.675 I think, the daal had a mix of sprouts or some veggies depending on the day, the dry vegetable was not repeated.

The per-meal cost comes down based on the number of days, For example, the cost for 30 days is Rs. 3000 (100 per meal). If you take the monthly plan you get 30 meals with a validity of 50 days as in you can choose which days you want the meal to be delivered within those 50 days.

**Note**

The aim of this post was not to bash or malign any tiffin service but just my personal opinion about the service, let people know about how things were since I could not find many reviews related to the service.

The website seems down I guess posting the review on Reddit really gave the site a heck of a lot of attention! :P",cp0vw1,,false,/r/india/comments/cp0vw1/masala_box_review/,Food

I'm looking for some meal prep ideas for Indian food. So far I've got these cubed andhra masala in my freezer that I use for making chicken without much hassle! Have you guys got any so far for? 

Here's what I've been thinking: 

\-- chopping up onions and grinding them to a paste and freezing them into cubes

\-- make some gravy bases in bulk - i.e. I love the mughlai so I'm planning to make this and then freezing them into cubes and storing

\-- readymade upma mixes that you just add water to and heat in microwave for 3-5 mins

&amp;#x200B;

Preferably without a pressure cooker.,"Hello. I'm at a point where I have rented a small place (I'm alone here) in Hyderabad, and might be here for a while.

I have never made anything except tea/coffee/Maggi, and I really wanna learn to cook *nutritious food* . Trying to start slow and learn 9-10 good dishes so that I can keep Swiggy usage to a minimum. Preferably without a pressure cooker, but I'm open to getting one *later*.

Foods -
Vegetarian food, eggs, and chicken

Tools - 
1. 1 induction heater
2. Something similar to this set - Prestige Omega Special Pack (3 Piece BYK Set, Both Gas Stove &amp; Induction Compatible) https://www.amazon.in/dp/B07SPZS1HL/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_yf9rDbTVD8NCE
3. The regular spatulas, spoons, etc.

Trying not to buy a pressure cooker right now. If I can make something decent and if I remain in Hyderabad for some months, will get one later.

Tentative ideas so far (just asking family and guessing) - 

1. Omelette
2. Spinach with some bell peppers
3. Carrots and beans sabzi
4. Bhindi with onions
5. Mixing bell peppers with some scrambled eggs?? (Is this even a legit dish?)
6. Poha with onions, tomatoes, and groundnuts

Swiggy escalation team calls me and offers me an option of refund of money or a coupon. I'm yet to receive either. Now there is only deafening silence.

I'm putting up this post to warn you people, that if you use Swiggy, please be careful. Please see the images that I've posted. The sad part is their escalation team accepted that there is a mistake and yet they don't care that they need to refund the money. Please see the pictures below that tell the story.

This one guy texts me about it and starts saying stuff like ""if you have a problem, go do something"" and shit.

Then he starts with the Kashmir issue.
While I am not against the striking down of 370, I am against human rights violations and stuff. He then proceeds to abuse me, call me cheap (that one I agree with him), anti-national,etc. He went on saying things that made it sound like he thinks that I am a terrorist...
So I asked him 'Do you think I am a terrorist'?
He was like ""yea, you are.""
So I try to explain what I stand for... And he from out of nowhere says ""then come *to a certain place* and say bleed Kashmir and bleed Kashmiri pundits"". I asked him why on earth I'd do that.
He said ""that's your favourite""..  so I asked him why he'd think that when I never said so. Then he proceeds to say he has a screenshot of me saying it and he will put it on twitter.

Now, not only have I never used the team  'bleed Kashmir', I had not even heard that phrase before. I still don't know what it means. 
I am genuinely worried that guy will like fabricate stuff to prove a point. And twitter is just a digital mob  and a kangaroo court, his BS can actually get me into trouble. 
I am also worried he may be a threat to my physical safety as well.


I have anxiety issues and I over think a lot..
Do you guys think I really need to be worried about this or should I stop worrying? 
What should I do?
And how do you handle such people? How common is this kinda thing?


To;Dr: a right wing guy is accusing me of saying ""bleed Kashmir"" and threating to put it on twitter.

Forward a week he keeps giving petty reasons and keeps delaying the delivery, he even said something was wrong with the motherboard so he had ordered for a new one and it was the reason why it was taking so much time, also said it would cost me 1k overall. Why would one need to replace the motherboard if laptop isn't charging? It was working great until the issue showed up. So I told him to return my laptop as it was when I gave him, asked him to not touch anything else. Paid the service charge and took it to Dell service centre the next day. The guy at dell looked into it and said many parts including the motherboard were replaced with cheaper and less durable ones... and my laptop would start having problems within a month due to that. I have no idea what to do now and whom to approach. The repairs guy isn't picking up my calls and his shop is closed since a week. Would a police complaint work?

When I was a kid, we used to have 2 to 3 days of pickle making sessions where all the adults would sit and cut mangoes, let them dry and then make pickles while my cousins and I would take the raw mangoes and eat them with salt and laal mirch. I don't remember the last time we did that, it's been years. We buy all our pickles in supermarkets now. Then I think of all the poojas my parents do and I know that I'm agnostic so I'll probably never do them in the future, but some of my religious friends don't care about it either.

Here it goes... Yesterday when I was returning from work in my bike, It suddenly started raining so I stopped to put on the raincoat and stuff.. When I started moving the wind was so intense so I was going slowly but one strong wind made me lose my balance... Before I could try and balance my bike, I hit an old lady who was pushing her cart (she is a local poor vegetable seller) who was coming in the wrong side of the road(as in going in the opposite direction of me in my lane)... Both of us fell but she fell on her head on the road and there was swelling on the back of her head... she cried and screamed out of pain.. I had also sustained injuries(i am alright now) but I took her to the hospital.. The doctor said there is nothing to worry about and that the pain would vanish in a couple of days and gave her meds.. I paid for the consultation and the meds and called that old lady's daughter and dropped them off at home with the help of a random stranger who was kind enough to help us.. I felt very guilty and sad for the old lady cos she sustained more injuries than me... I exchanged numbers with them cos I wanted to check on the old lady's condition later... I apologized to them so much cos I felt bad... 

Now that lady's daughter is calling me and blaming me and asking me reimburse them for the damage their cart has sustained.. She told me that the pain in unbearable to the old lady and asking me to come and take her to a doctor again... I'm like WTF... I told them whatever I did yesterday was a favor cos she was an old lady and I felt bad... And Infact it was the old lady's fault for coming in the wrong side of the road .... I told them to not take advantage of me just because I'm a nice guy.. Now she is threatening me that she will file a police complaint... I told them please go ahead... I will explain it to the police... 
I felt like crying imagining the pain that she must be going through... 

When I told all this to my parents and friends, they are calling a dumb guy for exchanging numbers and also paying for the consultation and meds as these local illiterate idiots will only try to take advantage of people who are trying to help them... 

I can't stop thinking about the old lady's pain and it makes feel so guilty.... I want to call that daughter to check on the old lady but everyone is telling me to not call them as they are people who lack gratitude and all... And may be they will try and get me into more trouble... 

What should I do? How do I deal with this guilt? How do I get to know the old lady's condition right now? Will I be in trouble if she goes to police?

(Fine people do that all the time in most other religions too I guess, but still, this is more about common people's faith than institutionalised hinduisms relationship to holiness)  

I guess the answer is something in line with varitions in and different levels of faith. So, a question aimed specifically at hindus of india; what is your relationship to cows?

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDmU0aQowRk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDmU0aQowRk)

As you will see the British began a census in the 1800s and began the 10 yearly census, in 1881, which continues to this day. There is an image of the Census Commissioner of 1901, also images of British living in India. Some British families lived there for multiple generations on tea plantations etc. The 1931 census showed a white population of India of 155,555. Most whites left when India became independent in 1947. However, in other parts of the British Empire when countries got independence, although the white population declined dramatically, some remained and continue to live there, and their descendants still live in the countries in 2019. For example - Rhodesia / Zimbabwe and Kenya.

What about India? Is there any whites living in India that have lived there since before 1947, or have family who have lived there since the days of the Raj, and continue to live in India. For example, lets say 2000 stayed in India, and have had families in the years since 1947, so the white community would now perhaps number 6,000. This doesn't include any that have move there since Independence. Does this even exist, (I've read about a few cases eg a white family involved in Tiger conservation, whose mother had remained in India after independence,  have you met any, or know of any, or did they just completely vanish after independence, and if so why do you think this happened in India when other places had small numbers that remained. Eg even after all the hardship, farm invasions etc there is still about 20,000 whites living in Zimbabwe in 2019, that have lived there (or their families have) before Zimbabwe became independent.",clcp6r,,false,/r/india/comments/clcp6r/in_the_1931_india_census_there_was_white/,AskIndia

But suddenly, it hit me (I am so glad it did). What if this guy is trying to scam someone else by using this code? I ask him why the number he is calling from is so different from my number and why can't he re-enter the number and get the code again.

When I checked his whatsapp, he has the photo of an army guy and Indian Army written on the picture. Lol.

1564854393,Throwaway_177013_,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cllk41/questions_about_the_legality_of_hentai_in_india/,1,32,,,Questions about the legality of Hentai in India after the POCSO act amendment,"I have a few questions regarding the POCSO act’s amendment and its implication on animated porn.
The recent amendment on the POCSO act states that 
**Child pornography, as per the new amendments, includes any visual depiction of sexually explicit content that involves a child. The visual depiction includes photos, videos, digital or computer-generated images indistinguishable from an actual child. This depiction includes any image which is created, adapted or modified but appears to depict a child.**


For the uninformed, a typical character in a hentai usually looks like [this](https://danbooru.donmai.us/data/sample/__emily_stock_original_drawn_by_ririko_zhuoyandesailaer__sample-c6e66a0d14dfef1771289c394d749b9e.jpg)

I’m really confused about what “indistinguishable from an actual child” means and would like to get some clarification on the law if possible.


1.Would animated porn of a fictional character easily distinguishable from real people that looks like an adult but is stated to be underage count as child porn under the POCSO act?

2.Can animated porn of a fictional character who looks like an adult and is distinguishable from real people whose age is not stated be considered child porn if the judge/police/law enforcement decide that it’s a child?

3.Can animated porn of a fictional character who is stated to be an adult but looks child like be considered child porn?

4.What is the legal definition of porn in India?
If animated shows depict underage characters in skimpy/revealing outfits can they also be considered child porn?

5.What are the chances of someone actually getting prosecuted if Hentai does in fact count as child porn?

6.This one might seem stupid but can figurines/statues/action figures count as porn?
Would something like  [NSFW warning](https://static.myfigurecollection.net/image/MastraCustom1389687000.jpeg) be considered porn?


Also please do note that I’m not referring to [Lolicon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lolicon), which generally involves very young female characters.

My apologies if this post isn’t fit for the subreddit but the POCSO act seems to be a serious law and I would hate to have my life ruined if someone reported me for watching hentai.

So I felt it would be best if I got some advice from people familiar with legal matters.

I kinda feel this is PTSD developed due to my altercation with my dad couple of years ago and all my episodes mostly with him leading upto the said altercation , I'm not sure that the said event itself is  a trigger point , but it is one of the things that tend to come to my mind post my episodes of  heightened state of fear / anger  . 
I tried talking to a therapist couple of times before but our interactions were never able to reach any fruitful state . Simply speaking , I believe I have too much to unpack , but when I finally get to talk to them it kinda feels like a lot of the troubling stuff seems irrelevant ,
 Sometimes somewhat borderline inappropriate  to our conversation . 

When someone asks me what's essentially wrong with me , I don't have a definate answer so it makes it incredibly difficult to ask family members for help , they just try their age old method of talking sense into me by asking me stop overthinking as if I have control , it makes it really difficult for me to socialize , fear of a breakdown . 

What do you think I should / can do ? Should i give my parents an ultimatum that they take me to a psychiatrist directly as  I was once referred to one by a psychologist but we just decided to not peruse it . I think they think I'm playing this therapy card every time I want to escape responsibility but they never expressed it outrightly  

I'm kinda free right now , waiting for my degree results , I'm 2 years behind my herd .Also no one in my life seems to be brave enough to confront me about my future , I'm scared of making a decision due to my present degree state , I wander too much so it kinda feels like I can do everything but when I attempt to figure out what to do , reallity hits me hard , so I'm super scared thus in constant denial",clm7nw,,false,/r/india/comments/clm7nw/so_is_it_ptsd/,AskIndia

Parenting where the intermediate solution for everything was hitting your child or yelling at them instead of having a proper clear minded discussion.


I am a female and I can very easily say that I was hit just as much as my male cousins were. I’m also an only child so my parents had no experience regarding parenting before me at all and neither did any chance come later on. 


Now that I’ve grown up, things have slightly changed but because I was in a very strict household, I really lack self confidence and I have a constant fear in my mind whenever I do/explore something new. The beatings stopped when I was in class 12th I suppose.. can’t remember exactly but that didn’t stop my fathers behaviour. He’s the kind to get angry at little things and there are always instances where if I say something which he doesn’t approve of, his first instinct is to scare me by moving ahead and yelling/showing hand (as if he’s about to hit me).
Not sure why he stops though but it’s just the fact that he still thinks physically assaulting me to “get me straight” is the correct way to go.


The relation I have with my parents is such that I can’t openly talk to them at all. With my mom it’s still relatively better but I can’t open up to my father at all. Car rides with him are silent. Sitting in the same room, no one says a word. I really envy my friends when I meet their parents and see how open and caring they are towards each other. Because of this, I also have a tough time opening up to other people. You develop such things at home only... and if the starting itself is so jagged, you obviously won’t do any better later on. 


Anyway, this feels like a personal rant but my only question is, why can’t my father change his mindset about parenting as he’s progressing? He’s open about factors like article 377, people marrying the person of their choice etc then why is he so narrow minded when it comes to treating his only child nicely? The fact that he always lunges forward to smack me with eyes wide and red hurts because I can never be sure of the fact that he’s just scaring me or will he actually hit me. My mother doesn’t say anything either. She only ever comes to console me later on if she finds me crying but that’s about it. I don’t know what to say anymore either because this is something I can’t share with my close friends. The fear of being judged always lingers in my mind. Thought I’d just pour my heart out on this anonymous platform instead. Writing this while crying but who cares.

He's back home in India and wants to extend his stay to work on his property, and is already about 3 months into the 6 months. 

Does anyone know exactly where I can get started on an extension for him? And if I can extend it long term? He is not on a tourist Visa, but an entry Visa that expires 2024, but I believe you can only stay 6 months at a time.

The short of it is that my boyfriend is an ABCD, his parents migrated in the 90s. He's their only child and is extremely close with them. He just graduated from university, has a promising future, but also has been going out with me, a white girl, for over a year now. It seems that we care for each other deeply and are quite serious about each other. (I know how apocalyptic the future of young couples like us statistically are, but we can't do anything but try.)

We started out with his parents on a super bad foot because when we were first going out together we didn't think it would go anywhere or be serious but because of weird housing circumstances they sort of ended up finding out about me and the fact that I was living with him for several months after it happened. His parents are quite liberal and spoil him a lot and know about various vices of his but, while never proscribing girlfriends (of different religions and ethnicities) they would always give him a lot of shit for it.

He's never been serious with anyone like he is with me and his parents, particularly his mother, are taking it extremely hard. I don't like throwing around psychiatric terms about people I don't know intimately but he understands his mom to be depressed, she routinely says things like the only thing she cares about is him and god and is extremely unhappy with life. My presence in his life has caused a lot of pain. They've had a lot of vicious arguments about it and it's made him suffer hugely. They want him to be with a nice Hindu doctor (""even if everybody else in the neighbourhood doesn't, we expect you to have made the right choice"") and I (like him oops) am neither of those things. He feels huge guilt that he is hurting his parents and fucking with his mom's already-grim experience of the world, cries about it all the time, but has no intention on giving up.

Ultimately they are the types of parents that will let him make the choice and I believe in the end everything will be fine, but I want to know how to get there. I want to be a part of his life and a part of his family and I don't want him to suffer like this or be in this antagonism with his folks. I'm not really asking for a how-to guide--what prompted this is that he just got home from visiting me, we are in an LDR, so it's not like I'm asking how I should act to win her favour, I won't see her in person for a long time. But, obviously, we have our perspective, his parents have theirs. To us, his parents and his mum especially are being far harder on me than she would be otherwise because of a worldview and set of values (religious and status-seeking) that mean very little to us, and the way it's easy for us to read it is that it's irrational and she's being overly protective and closed minded in large part because of depression. After so many months of dealing with it you just feel like you have to convince her to do therapy or something.

But that's also a bullshit response. I don't want to outsource my problem without understanding it first, I don't want to put her in front of some emotional bureaucrat figure and expect her to work things out (never mind that she would never do it if we just asked her to). From lurking here for a long time I read Randia as a voice of, like, young educated cosmopolitan guys in India, but I want a better emic perspective of what's going on in this 90s-migrant south Indian middle-aged very religious woman's head, with as much sympathy and generosity as possible, so that my bf has productive responses to her and so that I don't think of her as my enemy.

I'm writing this out because I'm down with a cold (o heartbreak) so I expect it's extremely weird and shambolic but I see thoughtful responses here often, so am ignoring my embarrassment and hitting post.",ckwyvl,,false,/r/india/comments/ckwyvl/i_dont_want_to_be_ruining_my_wouldbe_indian_mils/,AskIndia

Our opinion regarding our neighbors differ widely depending on what kind of political ideology we hold, and its probably the same on that side of the border too.

I'm going to take a neutral view on this, the world isn't exactly black and white. The extreme hindu nationalist view that every Paki is like a Burhan Wani or Hafiz Saeed is obviously very wrong. But equally wrong is the view of every pseudo leftist that they are like innocent kids holding lollipops! They aren't as bad as portrayed in movies like Gadar and Border, but they aren't as good as portrayed in Razee or Haider also. The truth is always somewhere in the middle or center.

Common sense tells me that most of them are just individuals like us who want to be happy in life. We aren't exactly good friends but we interact a lot culturally, our artists travel there and they come here. Looking at this positively, we are pretty much moving towards a European Union like situation, though we aren't exactly there yet. We get along well generally speaking, except when it comes to KASHMIR!

Now coming to that, let's take a simple house analogy. There are two families living in a single large house separated by a border going through, one family is called IN and another called PK. Each family gets along well with the other, some members move to the other side every now and then and chat with them through internet too.

Now imagine there is this schizophrenic child called KASHMIR who is throwing a lot of tantrums! This kid isn't able to decide whether it wants to move towards one family or the other (or may be it doesn't even want to live in that house but wants ""azadi"" from it!). Both of the families are emotionally attached to this kid and want it to come to their side. While the families usually get along well, they resort to verbal abuses and even fights when the question comes of taking custody of this kid!

I say why both families are spending 90% of their energies on this useless kid when they have more serious problems to deal with? Let them keep the existing relations they have with that kid (namely PoK and IoK from each family's perspective) and simply move on? Forget taking complete custody of that kid and move on with your lives. Let the kid throw all kinds of tantrums, don't listen to it. Both families' peace and prosperity is far more important than this one single kid. So, I say forget all about this kid and simply move on in life?

We are a middle class family and my dad worked hard to raise our family. He became a dealer of a motorcycle business and he is my role model and superhero. In 2018 using his hard earned money and a loan he planned to get a own house. Bought a land and appointed a mestri(head workman) for the house. 

In July, that mestri appointed a old person for transferring cement bags from one floor to another floor. He didn't eat properly the before day and that day he also didn't eat before coming to work. After transferring few bags he took rest my mom thought of giving him butter milk so when she went to get that from my old home that worker fainted and died. 

Emergency ambulance people came and verified that the person is died and the policemen came and asked something and told that nothing to worry. His people took his body. So we all thought that everything is completed and continued our normal life.

The very next day so many people from his caste and his relatives came and occupied the nearby streets and road. My mom was worried so she with her brother went to the person who is reputed person of our caste but that person started talking wrongly about my mom and her brother. The watchman at the construction went away with his family. Relatives didn't come to help. My dad came from other town at that evening. He went to the police station along with the other person from other caste for support. Police constable started framing wrong stories. The so called reputed person from our caste started supporting the died person caste people. The police man started talking vulgarly and he beated my dad with his belt. They refused to do postmortem. They told that if dad gives 9 lakh rupees to the other caste members then only they will do the postmortem.

So my dad had to pay 9 lakhs the very next day and the police agreed for postmortem. In the postmortem report it was stated that the person who died has heart and digestion problems. 


From that day I started considering caste as a filthy term. Loosing money is not the issue but seeing my dad in that position is the major heart break for me. He refused to fight against that because he is afraid of the system. Ofterall we are middle class OC people.

What I can remember: 

* **Genre**: Hindi pop song
* **Singer**: Male, lean and tall (at the time of filming)
* **Year**: 2003 or 2001 (A ""hit"" song during the month of CBSE board exam)
* **Lyrics**: (Not chorus) It goes by *kore kagaz ki tarah, adhoori (khali?) meri (hamari?) kahani hai* the next line is sung in the same tune. That is all I can recall. 
* **Music Video**: Filmed indoor with large open space, maybe just walls (dark) in an open field with no roof. Heavy wind blowing into the singer's face and all over the place (as you do). The singer wears sunglasses (totally unnecessary), dressed in black and he features in most of the video. He is stood in front of the car on occasions. The whole video has a dark blue hue and borderline black and white. 

That's all I can remember unfortunately. Frustratingly the song has been on the tip of my tongue for a fair few years and with every passing year it gets harder to bear the fact that I may die (not terminally ill) without ever being able to listen to this song once more. 

**TLDR**: Can't bear the fact I may never be able to find the song that reminds me of home and childhood memories.

1565474138,userreddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/coo8yj/do_you_remember_this_pankaj_kapur_safety/,3,25,,,Do you remember this Pankaj Kapur safety commercial from the 90s?,"It was a commercial about traffic safety in which Pankaj Kapur is driving a bus full of school children and has stopped before a railway crossing. A train is due at any moment and Pankaj Kapur is looking to go through the railway crossing. A local comes up to Pankaj Kapur and says ""bahi saab, train aa rahi hai"" and I always repeat this iconic line to myself where Pankaj Kapur replies ""manne ni pakarni. tu zara siide pe hoje"". He proceeds to drive through, only to have the bus full of school children be hit by the train.  


And then the public safety ad reminds the viewers to look both ways before crossing and only when it's safe.   


That line of Pankaj Kapur's has always remained with me and I'm wondering if anyone else out there remembers it too and if I can find it somewhere online.",coo8yj,,false,/r/india/comments/coo8yj/do_you_remember_this_pankaj_kapur_safety/,AskIndia

I recently interviewed with OYO for an SDE2 role at Hyderabad. The interviews went well and looks like I'll get an offer. I'm working at an MnC currently with a stable job and decent pay. Having never worked in a startup-like environment I would really appreciate some advice on the following things which would help me make a better choice. If any of you are current or former employees of Oyo that would be even better !

1. I've been reading a bit about Oyo in Reddit and one post talks about how Oyo is fudging numbers to show false growth. How true is this claim ? Not that it matters to a software dev but I would like to know what kind of a company I'm planning to work at.
2. How is the work culture ? One of the complaints about by current company is that its not very adaptive to latest tech. So it is pretty important to me that I get the freedom to choose what tech I want to use.
3. I read somewhere that you might be asked to work on Saturdays. Is this true ? If yes, how frequently does that happen ?
4. Lastly what kind of a salary can I expect for my profile ? (see below)

Here's my current profile:

* Current Role: Tech Lead (Promoted less than 2 months ago)
* Experience: just over 4 years

The idea would provide access to books to people that dont have access to a public library and cant afford to buy new books all the time. Instead they can subscribe to this ""virtual"" library and get books delivered to their neighborhood coffee shop. 


In the backend we will manage a warehouse of books that will cater to a large area with about 25 coffee shops and 2-3 delivery guys to manage the logistics. 


Advantage for coffee shops - increased traffic as people walk in twice, once to pick up a book and then to return the book. Also income from referral / signup fee for each new customer they send our way. 


There would be an upfront cost of housing a large enough catalog of books and a warehouse + delivery team plus a website/app.

I asked what was it about but he said they might have been instalments or bank charges so he ignored. 

Three days ago someone transferred ₹5000 three times in a single night without him noticing, neither did he get any OTP or the message after the money is debited from the account. 

We went to the bank to inquire about what it is and the Bank said that it says an Online Payment to Paytm has been made. In the Bank Statement there is the transaction number of Paytm, the Account Number of Paytm and Paytm.com written. Nothing else can be told from this. 

We told the bank to please give us the details of whose Paytm the money has been transferred to given that my friend only uses Google Pay because he doesn’t trust Online Wallets. 

He did not send anyone the photo of his debit card, there is internet banking which he regularly uses and no credit card has been issued on his account. 

Can bank provide the details of the account the money was transferred to if the higher banking officials help us or should we lodge an FIR and then ask the bank to move the process forward. 

From what I have read and asked around, it is that Bank Officials will ask Paytm to provide details and they won’t without an FIR and even after an FIR they don’t disclose the details of the customer. 

If someone has any experience regarding this please help 3 days have already passed.

This is not fiction. This just happened and I'm fucking shaking. I'm not a troll. I'm 17 years old(boy). I posted here a couple of hours ago showing the video footage that I was able to take during the scene. My question is- is this ok? If I had continued recording and didn't put my phone away, he probably would've stabbed me. After that I ran off to the bathroom, and he pushed the door multiple times. I was fucking shaking and managed to called my mother and she came thankfully. Now I could write pages about how my father has abused me since my childhood, but I'm really looking for some advice to what to do from the older, wiser people of reddit who have been through abuse. I have discussed with my mother and will be moving in with her in another city where she lives with her aunt and uncle. We already booked the tickets on redbus. We discussed this for a long hour. Now, in short my father is very controlling and abusive towards anyone who disobeys his every order. Several times over my entire childhood, he has had outbursts at night, beating and threatening to kill my mother and tonight me. So yeah, I'm really anxious while typing this. It's 1:30 am right now and I'm packing. We have a bus tomorrow at night but I am afraid he might do something in the mean time. My mother, who has suffered the same things when we were little says it's best to just ignore him. But today he just pulled out a knife and I was scared for my life. How long should we just ignore criminals? How long until something like this happens. Please I want some realistic advice here. I've been ignoring him for a long time now, I think this time something definitely needs to be done. 

Edit:

PS: More specifically he pulled out two knives and asked me to fight him. I put it down immediately. I was also recording at the time as nowadays whenever he gets in a bad mood and starts looking for me I start to record. I put away the phone coz I was terrified for my life. I couldn't record much after that. I managed to get the record up here(check post history) while I was hiding in the bathroom.

My mother has told me it is my fault repeatedly. I get how I might have provoked him a little, but I literally never talk to the guy, he is always the one who starts all this, including this one. I generally close the door when he's home for obvious reasons. This time he came into the room and shouted something and opened the door. I wanted to keep the door closed. I told him a bit annoyingly and that started everything basically. I actually have more recordings with me. 

And yes, some of you may think I'm exaggerating, or I'm only telling my side of the story. Check out the video in my post history that I uploaded from the bathroom(and after that I managed to call my mother and she came immediately). I am trying to give the fairest view on this as I can.

If you have any questions, please ask.

Option#1

Kashmir becomes a sovereign country inclusive of the portions under China, Pakistan and the Indian province. How do you suppose this country would survive and provide economic growth and development to it’s people?

Option#2

India gives up the portion to Pakistan. What happens next? Pakistan is struggling financially and is near bankruptcy. FATF’s positioning will even weaken the current fiscal position. Is that what better future for Kashmiris look like? 

I am trying to be rational and struggling to understand what is the expected outcome. India as a sovereign nation is free to choose what they do to a section of their constitution. One can debate the execution or approach to get there. Unfortunately no one will be able to “undo” this.

If this is about Muslims, what about China and what is happening there? What about Hong Kong and how China is handling that?

If the whole purpose is to protect identity of a community and such a noble cause, shouldn’t the approach be consistent!

Please help me understand the outcome which Imran Khan is trying to get apart from his political mileage. No one can coerce India to undo this like no one can stop China from assuming control of Hong Kong.

More on the campaign [here](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/restaurants-decide-to-pull-out-of-dining-apps-that-offer-deals-1565792728714.html)

So for those who haven't heard about it, the restaurants via their association ""National Restaurants Association of India""(NRAI) have broadly faced following issues.

1) The zomato gold deep discounting system is hurting their business since people misuse it by for example, on a weekend, get 1+1 on drinks at one place and then grab 1+1 on food at another place. This unarguably has hut the owner's pockets

2) Lack of transparency from Zomato on their rating system and the fact that Zomato provide details of customers using which Restaurants can build a loyal customer base.

3) Large chains like Domino's and McD are able to negotiate huge bargain on commissions(7-8%) while small restaurants have to agree to around 20-25% to even be visible on the platform. This doesn't include the hefty advertising fee. Hence, no uniform policy and systematic abuse of MSME eateries.

Now, these may seem like business decisions on part of Zomato to become profitable. Still, they have agreed to tweak Gold program, rather unfairly to us as customers. More on that [here](https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/zomato-rejigs-gold-service-to-benefit-restaurants-ceo-1566402560626.html)

Yesterday, Zomato Co-founder and CEO engaged in below the belt fights and said they were done with this campaign.

&amp;#x200B;

​

&amp;#x200B;

So I have got sort of a really troubled relationship with my mother.. my mom and dad separated when I was 3.. They were fighting a court case right up til 2011 over alimony/child support..It is clear to me that my mom hates my dad, and I can see why, although he hasn't done anything directly to hurt me, he left me when I was 3 ,got a new family when I was around 10,and pretty much spent all his time and money on them, once I went to meet him in his City and he didn't even invite me to his home, so although he wasn't a good father, I never really actively resented him for all this and accepted the reality...my mom however took a different path after the court settlements, which in her defense were quite unfair , My dad,earning above 20lakhs+ at the time, driving his own Sedan,agreed to give me 6k every month as child support, that was essentially his only contribution to my childhood..Anyway,my mom,she kept going after my dad , she'd keep on messaging horrible stuff ,call up his boss to tell that he abandoned his family, etc,so you can imagine the atmosphere at my home, although I didn't like this because it just created an everlasting tension for me since I used to talk to my dad while living with her, I didn't really do anything about it except for telling her to stop. Also mind that as soon as I got my own phone , she wanted to spy all over it to ensure I didn't talk to my dad, she would always blackmail me into giving my email password, she would check on my Whatsapp every other week and so on(rip school group chats),This was the starting of the deteriorating of our relationship, although I didn't see at that time (I was 13-14)what was wrong with her not letting me talk to my dad, subliminally it was worsening my relations with her,ADD THAT to the fact that she is a classic indian control freak parent, and you have a recipe for disaster. Eventually, it deteriorated to the point where we weren't talking a lot to each other and realised that we'll probably stop talking once I go to college..

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway , fast forward to today..My dad has seperated from his 2nd family as well, and I discovered that he gave them 10 lakh rupees as a one time settlement (compare that to what he gave me),gives me about 15k child support every month,and he takes every chance to brazenly tell me that , it's beyond me how he can pay a million rupees to someone he essentially adopted and treat his only real son solely as a beneficiary of his salary..Now, my relations with my mom are worse, if anything, we barely talk, every conversation somehow ends up by her bringing up the past and start thrashing my dad out of nowhere,and it all goes downhill from there , the second that I actually try to reply to her,she threatens me to kick me out of the house,she has actually done it some times and I can't really afford that as this is a make or break time for my life(read:JEE prep).. I still talk to my dad about twice a week over the phone but that's about it,as long as I talk to him about general stuff like my grades, it's fine.. The second I ask him for anything(say a pair of shoes), he asks me to get it from my mother, because she has a ton of ancestral money(she doesn't) and although in the end usually I get what I ask for, it's repugnant to think that all these years, his argument has literally been this, he thinks that he is vindicated from his duties as a father because my mom has enough money to sustain us ,and I get to see his real picture, and also realise that alas it was my mother who bought me up all through my childhood, and although our relationship has been extremely toxic for almost half a decade, she was the one,picking me up from school, making my lunch everyday, going to my PTM , stuff like that, I feel terrible and also responsible for the state of our relationship today, and so literally, I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place..I know there is no way to overcome this dilemma, I just wanted to get some 3rd person views..",cuq534,,false,/r/india/comments/cuq534/my_relationship_with_my_parentsbetween_a_rock_and/,AskIndia

Is this an established migration route, like Indians going to the Gulf or Singapore?","Basically I am asking this, because my parents maid a young, unmarried lady told us recently she will be leaving us next month because she is going abroad to Russia to work. However when they asked her about the details many things seemed suspicious. Firstly, they are going there by ship, the destination is a very isolated town where they will perform agricultural work. However she told me others from her area have already gone thought she does not know anyone personally. 

When my mother told her, in a polite manner, this seems suspicious she just kept repeating that it was real. My father then said to her, in a rude/condescending tone, that she was being naive and that she should listen to them because she does not have the knowledge to recognize these things. This made her angry (she worked for my parents for 3 years, never showed any anger/rudeness even once), and said no one will give her a chance in India to do anything because she is poor so this will be her only chance to achieve something with her life.

After this my mother changed the subject and calmed everyone down. Since then she does not chit chat with my parents anymore when coming to work like she used to, only does work quietly and leaves. 

In someways I do feel sorry for her, she left school at 14. My mother told me she once saved money to buy an mini icebox which she used to sell ice cream by standing outside functions in her neighborhood, but her parents made her give the icebox to her brother-in-law (as part of her sisters dowry I guess) after they saw she was earning decent income from it, and he kept all profit, which upset her a lot. 
Anyway my 2 questions are...

1. Does anyone know if Indian going to Russia to do manual work is a real thing? Specifically work in a place called Kamchatka? I searched online but cannot find any examples of Indians doing manual work there.

I got a camera and started learning photography and still learning and one thing that interested me from a very long time is Flying/driving/riding. I always love to drive/ride. Now I am thinking to learn how to fly but I thought it was impossible because you need physics and math ( I am a commerce Student) as an entry requirement. Recently I was looking for flying club for hobby flying and I cam across Bombay Flying Club. They have multiple courses. 

  
 STUDENTS PILOT’S LICENCE (SPL)

 PRIVATE PILOT LICENCE (PPL)

 COMMERCIAL PILOT LICENCE (CPL)  
 [https://www.thebombayflyingclub.com/Pilot\_training.html](https://www.thebombayflyingclub.com/Pilot_training.html) 

  
For the 1st two there is no Physics or Math requirement for learning how to fly but for Commercial Lience you need   Physics and Math’s.   


So what I was wondering If I complete  PRIVATE PILOT LICENCE (PPL) or they also havbe Single Engine Flying Training will I be able for Commercial Pilot Licence like will I be able to join airline industry as pilot.

Is minority appeasement politics to blame here?,"[Please remember this is my personal opinion. I am open for counter arguments and honestly hoping that I am wrong as I would like for things to be better]

Hi,
I've been wondering about this for some time. The Indian voter had become increasingly politically polarized in recent times. Many would attribute this to the rising right wing in the country. But I believe the rise of right wing in recent time is linked to rising resentment in the majority Hindu population with the invearse in minority appeasement politics in the other mainstream parties.

Democracy works best when parties campaign on generic issues on the forefront. This leads to voters voting for the party with the best manifesto. Voters are not loyal to one party and will vote for they opposition if the current ruling party messes up.

But what if one party starts providing benefits specifically to one Minority/ group? Humans are instinctively selfish creatures and tbh if a party promises something specific to me or my community, I would vote for them. Keep doing this and you generate a messaiah subject relation with the voters, and the respective community becomes faithful to your party. This might be enough to sway the total votes to your favour, given the majority is still divided.

With time, the public is increasingly divided and hostile to other parties as it is now either their party (with the specific benefits promised) or the others, which do nothing for you. 

This has carved up the voter base in India into distinct sections voting only for freebies or specific policies which only affect them, even at the expense of others.

Do you guys think this is an issue in current times? 

If yes how does politics go back to the way it was before? Why would a party running on appeasing a specific community give it up when this doesn't give them any benefits?

I believe the rise of the BJP can be related to this too. With regards to my relatives living in UP, they will now not vote for SP or BSP in any situation as this will only lead to development of ""other"" people and believe BJP is the only way to get their voice heard. Given that my relatives are conservative hindus, and with them being the majority, how will other parties ever win, given that they have lost the majority votes to a party doing minority appeasement, only this time, it is for the majority.",cp8xyy,,false,/r/india/comments/cp8xyy/increasingly_polarized_political_opinions_in/,AskIndia

My current ISP is [Hathway](https://media1.tenor.com/images/db3bb9f86385cb9f751d9d18ef8dd0bb/tenor.gif) (I'm from Secunderabad btw) and the service is pathetic. I was new to the city and didn't know much about the ISP scene here. I fell for their scheme and have been suffering for about two months now.

Today, I called a technician for internet downtime and he told me this: ""yeah, that happens (he was really like ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯); but you know i'm a hardware technician, so idk"". The router that they advertise as free of cost is a prime example of crappy hardware. It took me 3, yes, 3 frickin days to know the password for the router login page. Why? The people at customer support didn't, in the first place, _know_ what a router login page is. The first two people who responded told me the default wireless password, which is on the bottom sticker already. Fortunately(!), one responded properly at last and told me some h4x0r-like password and it worked, thankfully. Now, the first thing I did was change the router password. Lo and behold, the router went ded. Just like that, ded :| I can no longer sign in, even with their password, and I can't change the SSID or wireless passwd. Ok, I reset the router and now it works, but lesson learned: don't mess up with this crappy router. All the 3 days of waiting went in vain. Nice. Now, I'm stuck with this bad router, can't download &gt;20GB per day (and honestly, some days even less than 20), can't change the ISP cause I stupidly subscribed for three months.

Earlier, my ISP was Excitel and they were surprisingly good. ~600/month, 50Mb/s, no limits at all. It was nice, and they generously offered me another plan where I can have ~40Mb/s unlimited, but with a static IP with all my ports open! But we shifted to a new house, which is, literally &lt; 150 metres away, just a couple buildings away. And they say service isn't available there. So I had no choice but to switch to some other provider. I'm a heavy internet user, so I can't stand low FUP limits. But looking at the current situation, it seems I barely have any choice.

My current plan expires by the 2nd of September. Where I lived before, I had unlimited plans with low speeds, which I can totally tolerate. I can tolerate 30 Mb/s with no limits and I'd buy a static IP. But I can't see any similar plans here. I heard ACT has a better service, but the prices are high. Also, there's an Airtel plan for about 699: _upto 40Mb/s unlimited + calls + Airtel TV + Netflix, Amazon Prime_ and the likes. Now I don't need the Netflix and Amazon subscriptions, but the _**upto**_ feels misleading. Please help me pick my next ISP. I don't want to waste money on some crappy ISP again :(

My mother is a housewife with two kids (me and my little brother). I work as a backend developer in Gurgaon while my brother is in 11th standard right now. My parents and my bro are settled in Hyderabad. 

Mom doesn't have a great educational background (B Com. dropout years ago and poor fluency in English). She always talks about wanting her own source of income like starting a small canteen or getting a job or something like that. 

My father quit his job a few years ago and earns a 50k pension. He is trying to setup some business and has blown all his savings on it and has huge debts from some relatives including me. He is also a major self-centered prick who doesn't seem to care too much about my mom and always discourages her...which btw I think is one of the biggest reasons why my mom wants to earn for her own.

I have already suggested her to get started with some English classes because she'll probably have a lot more options once she's fluent in it. Do you guys have any idea how I can help her get some income for herself?

I (19,M) am studying engineering in Mumbai. I have really high travel and residential expenses. I wish to independently handle my expenses. I am also an aspiring actor, so there are theatre expenses as well. 
All I want to know is... is it easy to manage studies, theatre and work? Is it even possible for an Indian student? I recently met my cousins from the US, and I was so envious of them being so independent. They earn like $10 per hour and work for 10-15 hours a week. Why is it that only us students from India can't work? We are spoon fed, we are not independent, and we (a lot of students) hardly study. I really wanna be productive being a student. I can't afford to waste this time especially after wasting 18 years of my life. 
Anyway, for work, part time, 
I have a few choices available with me : 
*Part Time Jobs Which Are Hard To Get, But You Earn Decent* 
• Tutor Mathematics at IIT-JEE level.  
  I'm really good at math and confident in teaching it to a small audience. 
• Video Editing 
  I am experienced at editing videos, learning After Effects for 2 years and I think I can be a good assistant editor or something. My work has earned me over 1000 followers on instagram and youtube as well. 
• Content Writer
 To be frank, I have no writing experience. I like Reddit and Quora, but I think I may struggle writing articles and blogs. But I am very interested because I have a good control over my English, I guess. Idk 
*Part Time Jobs Which Are Easy To Get, But You Are Paid Less* 
Convenient Stores, Fast Food Places like McDonalds, KFC etc. One thing I know for sure is, they're always hiring. I read somewhere on Quora that they pay freshers(students) roughly ₹80-₹100 per hour. If I work for 10 hours a week (5 hours each on Saturday and Sunday), I'll just have ₹4000 in hand, a month. That's very less. 

Please help advising me anything you know regarding part time jobs for a student. Thank you.

Been checking the weather since yesterday. On Friday and Saturday, at Thanjavur, weather will be: cloudy till 3 P. M., scattered/ isolated thunderstorm from 3 to 7, and thunderstorm at 7 or 8.

2 Buses between Thanjavur, Darasuram, and Gangaikonda Cholapuram.

How frequent are the buses and how much time is needed to travel between them?

3 Nice place to stay for one night.

Nothing fancy. A decent hotel with a comfy bed and clean toilet. I'm planning to stay at Darasuram.

4 Exploring the temple complex.

I like exploring places at my own pace. Can I get enough info about the temples online or should I hire a guide?

I live in USA and have been looking to venture into social entrepreneurship.  I  wanted to start with the idea or a problem that I can associate with, try the concept as an experiment and figure out a way to raise money and scale the idea.   For that reason, I reflected at my past and realized that till 17-year old, I did not know that I could see things far away.  Only when I accidentally put on my friend's glasses while flying a kite,  I realized how beautiful the world is. My studies and overall life improved once I got the glasses.  It felt to me that I was an exception, however when I started to question my Indian friends on how did they come to realize that they need prescription glasses, the story was similar, and some were very interesting. The most general theme was the teacher moved me to the last bench in the class, and I struggled in studies. These are folks that were from middle-class India who can afford a visit to the optometrist in India. I was wondering how many kids do not realize that they need prescription glasses, and more importantly, they cannot afford a visit to optometrist and purchase frame with lenses.  I wanted to conduct an experiment of visiting a school in a poor area and checking their eye prescription and give them lenses + frame for free.  However, there are several hurdles. Checking eye prescription (which can have sphere+cylender+axis) is doable with a portable lens kit. I have already bought one and tinkering with it and requires training.  However, issuing glasses with sphere+cylender+axis) is complicated.

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to limit the experiment with myopia and eliminate addressing the issue of stigmatism. That way if I carry 100 standard frames(same size) and 1000 lenses(fits the frame) of different spherical power to a school, after simple testing of eye power, can issues frame with lenses to children on the spot and advice them to visit optometrist if they have astigmatism.   If this works, we can scale the idea if we can raise the money. Also, many folks already tried to solve this problem with newer machinery and addressing sphere+cylender+axis issue, but they failed as the cost is too high and could not achieve economies  of scale.

I am not an optometrist but plan to meet some to discuss the details. But wanted to check with you all if this is something doable + will help kids in school or do you see a significant gap in the idea.  If it's something, we shall attempt as an experiment. If 'Yes,' any purpose about where I can find good quality 100 frames and 1000 lenses of different spherical power.",cvzhln,,false,/r/india/comments/cvzhln/need_your_help_advice_on_conducting_an_experiment/,AskIndia
1566882424,illbetheillest,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cvzsdx/i_need_advice_on_how_to_go_forward_with_this/,6,22,,,I need advice on how to go forward with this.,"In the 26 years of my life I've heard my father scream emptily threatening: ""I will commit suicide"" or ""I will give you a divorce"" so much at my mum, that today when he finally screamed the same old things at her, I said ""lets go to the police and court"" to which he said: ""no! why will we go to the court? lets just live separately instead"".
When I continued stressing about going to the court, he angrily stormed off the house with another of his old threats saying ""I will leave this house"". I followed him, just like I've been doing the last couple of times and he went and sat angrily in a park for the next 3 hours while I waited patiently outside, I did not speak a word with him thru this whole ordeal. after which he came back home and rejected having lunch my mum prepared and went off to the office.
that was 10 'o'clock in the morning. I had to skip office today because I was mentally paralysed and had to curl up in bed sleep the entire day.

My father, initially when I was a kid, was both physically and mentally abusive to us, though with time he quit abusing physically but his mental torture became worse. he forced my mum to shut the business she was running and economically strangled her when I was in 4th grade. He cut her ties off both with her family and friends circles and isolated her, He has said and continues to this day say horrendous things to and about her which are completely false and cause irreversible psychological damage to her (extremely low-self esteem, self pity and loathing) 

my childhood memories with him include (to quote a few):
Him taking us all to a lake in our city to jump into and commit suicide one late evening  
Him hitting me with a belt one day after coming home from office.
Him throwing plates with food around the house that my mum cooked and served him.
My mum either being extremely anxious or crying because of him.
His earth-shatteringly loud shouting.
Also recently in the last one year, after researching his behavioural patterns, I figured out that he has Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) the extreme of its kind.
that did help us a bit to understand him and tolerate him better thanks to all the articles and youtube videos available online. me and my mum sat down and discussed strategies and solutions to bear with his behavior without in anyway aggravating it. 
but at least once every month (at least!) he triggers my mum to a point where she just can't keep quiet anymore and then uses that opportunity to belittle her further and further and make her feel like a piece of trash.

I come from an Indian family and live in an extremely conservative society. My mum has, ever since her marriage, been conditioned to fear the society's judgement and insults that will come with divorce. Initially when I was just a baby and she wanted to quit her marriage, she approached her own father who asked her to shut her mouth and learn to deal with it.
she is absolutely terrified of divorce and cannot imagine a life like that and would much rather prefer living in this hell day-in and day-out because a known devil is better than an unknown devil.

I am a 'man' who has just entered his late 20's, but I don't feel man enough, I feel like a child and I find myself behaving like one too. All of my childhood has been extremely depressening with a lot of issues, I was sexually abused as a kid by a family member, bullied in school and failed most of my subjects. And whenever I'm around my father I'm mentally crippled by anxiety. I have stopped speaking with him for the past two years now even though we live in the same house, which he blames my mum every other day for apparently brainwashing us against him.

He gives my mum money that's less than enough to run the house comfortably, even though he earns pretty well, and then she has to beg him for more money, at which point he starts abusing her even more and throws the money at her condescendingly. 
Even though I am slowly becoming financially independent, there is still quite some time before I become absolutely independent, but that doesn't seem to help my case because I cant move out if my mum won't. and even if I did, I'd have to constantly live in the fear of him physically or mentally abusing her with more freedom than ever, with no one around to protect her.",cvzsdx,,false,/r/india/comments/cvzsdx/i_need_advice_on_how_to_go_forward_with_this/,AskIndia

Just last night, I posted a series of stories on Instagram about my views on it and I did criticize the forces' and government's past actions. Basically I pointed out how when we talk about KP genocide we should also talk about how AFSPA has been grossly misused by forces there and the atrocities they committed in torture camps against the Kashmiri Muslims. The government already has avenged KPs but now what they're doing is state sponsored terrorism. The govt has now become fascist and authoritarian.

I also wrote how we should put our faith in the people and not the government because this government is not for the people . They're oppressive and controlling the narrative. 

Also, I am from the forces background. I did write that put your faith in people and not the government because this government has agendas and has already failed us by passing all these bills whilst ignoring the demands of the communities concerned with those bills.

My Insta account is not private. It does have my pictures. I just have 800 followers. So my mom read those stories and got really pissed off. She said I could be taken away by the government. They could charge me under SEDITION and I should delete them. Also got a moral lecture about how you have been brought up in the forces and yet your views disgust me. 

TL;DR : So basically I want to know ,

A) Can I or anyone be charged for sedition for showing solidarity with Kashmiris or speaking against the government in words like I did?

Anyway. Here are my options:

1. FZ-S Version 3.0: Very goodlooking and smooth but felt underpowered when I rode it. Doesn't quite pull like a 150 cc should.

2. Apache RTR 160: Have test ridden only the RTR 200 and it felt pretty powerful although a little uncomfortable. Has amazing brakes, one tap and the bike freezes on spot.

3. Pulsar NS 160: Not ridden yet. Heard bad things about Bajaj engine quality. Rear seat doesn't seem to be the most comfortable for female pillions

4. Honda Hornet: Not ridden yet but looks kinda vanilla.

5. Suzuki Gixxer: Engine seems smooth but could've been a little easier on the butt. Heard bad things about their after sales support.

I procrastinate at everything single thing I have to do. Now its come back to bite me in the ass.

So, I scored around 79% in 12th Boards (CBSE-Commerce) last year, and had no idea what to pursue for my further studies. I posted here at that time for guidance but didn't really get satisfying answers. Time kept passing and most government colleges had stopped taking admissions. Fast forward to August, with no idea what to do and parental pressure, I had to opt for BCA in a tier 3 college in my home town. At that time, I thought this course would interest me but after completing my first year there, I can say that I have no interest in programming.

Now instead of applying to different colleges this year, I spent most of my time playing video games at home after my exams. College started in June and I still haven't attended a single class. I honestly felt really depressed during this period and found my escape in video games and stuff. I can safely say that I still have no idea what to pursue in my life and now that government colleges have stopped taking admissions, I am not left with much choice.

Now, I need some serious advice on what to do moving forward.

1. I can either start attending my college, and put up with whatever subjects even if they don't interest me.

2. Drop out and wait till next year to apply to other colleges.

3. Apply to a private college.

I really don't want to do the first, as I feel like it would be waste of my parents' money to do something I have no interest in. I feel like this is the only place where I can talk about this as I really need some serious guidance on what to do.

Just signed up to ask this question. I wanted to gift a great mattress - the Rolls Royce of mattresses to my octogenarian parents. Price is not a major criteria for me. I can go up to Rs 1.5 lakhs on a King size. 

I stumbled upon the team-bhp mega thread that mentioned Snoozer mattress as supposedly one of the best - apparently also used in many five star hotels in India. 

Mom had lower back problems with the bone being worn out and she was wearing one of those belts as per ortho doctor's advice.

I went to a Snoozer showroom in Chennai. The manager recommended ""Posturecare"". We also tried BeautySleep and Presidential, both of which my mom absolutely loved. She was not too keen on Posturecare, saying it felt no better than the 12 year old cheap firm mattress that parents have been using. 

I tried Snoozer Posturecare as well and it didnt feel like a luxury mattress. I understand it has sophisticated technology but it didnt feel anything special or luxurious to me at all. My mom says why spend so much on such a firm mattress, why not just get a low end brand firm mattress ?

So, in short, why is Snoozer Posturecare better than your run-of-the-mill firm mattress ? What would be your elevator pitch for those who use it ? 

Seriously considering BeautySleep but worried that my mom may start developing back pain after weeks of use ? I dont want to risk Presidential as it feels too soft and luxurious and I suspect it may give back problems. 

I wonder if I should check with my mom's ortho doctor ? Nor that I am expecting him to recommend any specific brands. 

apreciate any response. Thanks a bunch !",cw7je7,,false,/r/india/comments/cw7je7/mattress_for_very_elderly_snoozer_or_better/,AskIndia

Watching videos on Youtube, Facebook, whatsapp, playing candycrush. They are more active on social media than I am. I do not know whether to laugh or to cry.

They got their smartphones about 3-4 years ago and they are not that familiar with the term called ""fake news"". They think **if it's on the internet it has to be true.** I keep telling them to be more sceptical of the things that they watch online and to only trust well-known sources. But they think I just overreact to things.

See I don't care if they consume some false information about kashmir. But I do care when they start watching diet or health related videos on youtube and whatsapp and ,make some lifestyle changes. And they do watch those videos even after repetitively asking them not to. They say ""But his youtube channels name is Dr. something "". They just think that everyone is just honest and truthful on the internet.

I'm not a doctor to judge the health related content on those youtube channels may be they are real doctors in their life and may be they are speaking truth. but No one should believe in it without verification.

I am worried for our country. Some people are just not ready for it. I just feel like other developed nations have well educated population who can probably thwart fake stuff to some extent. But here, for some people internet is just so new, that they don't know what kind of beast it is. There are a lot of bad actors.

So:

0- Am I worried for no reason ?

1- Do we need a Internet 101 for non tech-savvy people ? 

2- Do you think people should know about basic internet security and privacy practices ?

3- do you think that government should actively regulate content ?

4- what are your thought in general about this ? any solutions ?",cwbi3p,,false,/r/india/comments/cwbi3p/how_can_we_make_indians_resistant_to_fake/,AskIndia

My fiancé  is White (also born in Australia, lived here his whole life). We're both vegetarians as well. For all intents and purposes, I look Indian, despite not being from India, and can speak and understand Hindi, but not read or write it. 

As for my question, we're visiting India in October (flying into Amritsar and out of Kolkata), and I was wondering if we'd run into any trouble being seen together? I'm already used to getting stared at by Indian men (sorry, I know not all Indian met are not all like that), so I'm not worried about that. I'm also used to the judgement I've gotten from India-Indian people for being from Fiji haha. 

I've read a lot about India but have read much more negative hateful articles than positive ones about interracial couples and I'm just wondering how 'real' these articles are, and if we should be concerned?

My two questions are about the past and present respectively:

#1: If Great Britain left India without taking responsibility of establishing democracy, what could have happened and is there any particular way of living that you would like old India to have used (back to monarchy under rulers or tribes with villages, etc)

#2: Do you think the majority of Indians live with a purpose? Do they care about how they'd like society to run? Or are they aimlessly following orders for money. Is this lack of purpose stem from the way all of us are thrown into a society that we didn't design for ourselves and expected to live? And if society is to be demolished and rebuilt for the Indian people by our rules and standards, what kind of world would that be?

Tips to pivot career or any feedback welcome!,"Sorry to add to the ""unemployment ka rona"" pile here but I'm very, very frustrated with life right now. 

Background:
Worked for 5 years with non-profits and have a degree in humanities. Joined this sector because I actually care about doing good, making a positive contribution to this world. 

Had to leave my last office based job and come home because of family issues.

Right now, nobody is making any money in my household and we have medical expenses that are digging into the money we have saved. So you can see why getting a job is so important to me.

My last job was contractual and remote, that ended. It didn't pay much and after that, I've got nothing so far. I'm just glad there aren't big gaps in my CV.

I've been applying to a lot of jobs now but for some or the other reason I am not selected. I understand the rejections where I didn't meet the expectations of interviewers but there have been some rejections where I was told that the organization changed structure and the role doesn't exist anymore (why even interview and post that job opening?), I've been ghosted (horrible this is) and told ""I'm not a good fit"" (vague af). Someone told me they wanted a more structured response to my answers and another one interviewed me for an hour and then she picked up on the name of one org I kept mentioning and asked me why I mention it so much if I just interned there. She was looking at someone else's CV. Rejected me.

I don't know what the heck is happening, even my colleagues from past jobs are surprised it's so hard to land a job. 

Even while I'm mostly qualified for some roles I can't apply to them because they require a Master's degree. I thought of studying again but I'm broke af. My father's credit is bad (idk why) so I can't get a loan and nor can he. Plus, I am the only one in my family with proper education and experience to land a job which can provide regular income. 

I'm so confused what to do. People tell me to just focus on uni applications and go abroad but:


1.) I have no guidance whatsoever where to apply, what to do. I can figure some of this out on my own but then:


2.) Who will provide for the family when I'm studying?


3.) No money and can't get loan.

Questions:


1.) Where can I look for jobs outside of the non profit sector, given that my experience is only in this sector?

I write well (this post is not a good example of that, I'm writing for Reddit and this is an informal platform). I'm good with interpreting data and researching things for articles. I have qualitative research experience. I can manage projects well and I'm good with basic tech and know very basic coding (python). I am good at manging teams and have decent people skills. I'm not good at writing long form fiction and having nothing to do (don't like going to work and not doing anything at all).



2.) If you were in a position like mine, what would you do: study or work or what?

I'm lost and every rejection only brings down my mental health and I think it will do long lasting damage if this goes on. I need a win, some hope. Any feedback and guidance is very, very welcome!

Thanks!

But commercially, this is a masterstroke","Personally speaking, I just hate the idea of #Jio releasing movies first day on mobiles and TVs, which people can watch from home. Watching movie in a cinema theater is not just about watching a film, but its the overall experience: The thrill of grabbing tickets of a hit movie, the anticipation while getting ready and traveling to the theater, the strange feeling while entering the dark theater, smell of popcorn and more.

But commercially speaking, this is a masterstroke, as it will allow new movies to reach places where it can't otherwise. Like when I stay in Dehradun, I need to travel 70 kms to watch a movie in a theater.

PVR and Inox have issued statements on this development, and they are clearly scared. This move can harm them, if not destroy them.

Few facts which movie lovers should know:

- America and Europe have banned Netflix from streaming movies first day of their release. France has a law which prohibits Netflix and others for 36 months before streaming a new movie.

- In India, there is a law that a new movie can be streamed only after 8 weeks of its release

- This is cool fact: In Tamil Nadu, often it has been seen that a movie gets into Amazon Prime/Netflix after 8 weeks, but still, people go to theaters and watch them. Absolute crazy stuff. I love Tamil Nadu for this passion!

- In 2018, Indian cinema made Rs 17,000 crore, out of which 75% came via direct ticket sales at cinema theaters.

Reliance is a big company, and they can swallow entire Bollywood in one gulp. But I hope they dont do it.. First day show on Jio platform is a cruel idea. There should be a gap of atleast 4 weeks.

Otherwise there will be no charm for film-makers to make stories which can be only experienced in a theater.",cq41ad,,false,/r/india/comments/cq41ad/jios_plan_to_show_new_movies_first_day_is_an/,AskIndia

Also the use of propaganda as a tool (tribals in NE and Central India were accused of being cannibals, Hindus sacrificed their babies by feeding them to crocodiles, both are 'devil worshippers' etc.).

I have learnt Java on my own in the past few months and now I'll try to learn some frameworks like Spring, Hibernate.

My question is whether I'll ever be able to get into a product based company like Uber,Ola,Amazon, Flipkart etc. I know companies like Google, Microsoft are out of my scope for now.

I need to know what should I do to find a job. Most of the jobs I find for Java developers require atleast 3-4 years of development experience.

Or is joining a startup my only option? I also can't depend on my parents anymore for money and hence I'll have to join one that pays decent. I've heard stories of startups not paying there employees for months.

1. Friendly customer service at branch who can help with your requests and able to understand your problem.
2. Should have multiple ATMs across India or alternatively their debit card should work in other banks' ATMs without incurring heavy charges.
3. Netbanking should be easy to use, more features the better!

She is married but relatively young(about 28 yrs). She had propositioned me in the beginning when she had joined the office and after a few days of knowing me. I was going through some personal issues of my own and hence turned down her proposal. One of my other friends in the same office took a liking to this girl and she also fell in love with him and ultimately they got married. She continues to talk with me, however I am kind of hesitant to talk with her as she is married and I do not want any rumours regarding us. Hence I stopped talking to her for  quite some time but she just forces me to talk with her. Sometimes i just keep minding my work but she will come to my seat and start talking and smile all along. She has broached the subject of her married  life on more than one occassion and how she is not happy with her  in laws.

Hi all. I just traveled to India from California for the first time about a week ago. I only traveled in S India for 3 weeks. Just a curious question. When you buy things in India, they are so adamant about giving you the GST invoice, whether it's for clothes, a hotel stay, not so much for food.

Do normal Indian citizens keep all these receipts for tax purposes? Me as a tourist, I was like what am I supposed to do all with all these receipts. I don't think I was able to get money back, like other countries. I think Taiwan maybe at the airport you can get money back on taxes. Are GST invoices just a quirk of India, or do business travellers just require these for company purposes? Thanks all.",cxx7d6,,false,/r/india/comments/cxx7d6/gst_tax_invoice/,AskIndia

I did'nt shared the reports which were normal.

The 3rd day in the hospital- She saw my reports and her words were the same 'admit kar wa do jaundice hai'. So after one day I got admitted on sunday. There was AC and TV in the room that made me smile. No one else except me cared for the TV. So, on the first they took some blood and started   
supplying some fluid medicine through the injection that was implanted on my right hand. On the bottles it was written NS and DNS they also supplied fluid. The next day 6 of my school friends came to me.The days went on and they supplied medicine injected medicines through  injection and gave some tablets. One day 2 or 3 doctor's cane and said that Dengue NS1was positive in the report So they took some blood for platelets count and it was normal. After 5 days of my life at hospital I was discharged and given some medicines and a revisit after 5 days. In these 5 days there was swelling  in the corners of my mouth. So , again went to the doctor, this time it was mumps another blood infection she again gave some medicines some blood reports and a revisit after 5 days. Mumps disappeared in two days. She also took some some blood for LFT,CBC

This time the concern is my platelets had incresed to 480   which should be in range of 163 - 369.

Please help me ,this is concerning me.

My neighbor is from India, and our kids are friends. They recently went back to India for a couple months and my neighbor told me she would like to get a Sari made for me. When she told me this I was blown away! We aren’t that close, we do not talk very much, but like I said, our kids are friends and go over to each other’s houses to play often. So this seemed like a very grand gesture and it almost brought me to tears. Long story short, she brings it back, it’s beautiful, then she shows me online what jewelry I should order to accompany it.

I am even more confused about her wanting me to get the accompanying jewelry. I am just wondering if I am missing something. Is she expecting me to go somewhere to wear this?

India is a great place to visit I've always defended India here from the stigma it gets. I did visit alot of places and when I went to see hamuyuns Tomb I had noticed there was a significantly higher price for admission for foreigners. I was really taken by surprise but I paid expecting that's a rarity (I had seen the lotus temple earlier so I expected just to pay for parking). However even when I went to rajasthan and Agra almost all the sightseeing locations were jacked up in price by atleast 5 times the price minimum. Like it was getting ridiculous how much it was starting to cost. I get the whole thing with how I'm a white tourist (my family has an ligher skinned descent) and expected to have more money but come on like the price is getting nuts. What's the story with that does the government not own those properties? Is it like the parking and everything is privately owned or is the government trying to charge extra for sightseeing? Like how will people ever change their opinions on India if they have to pay like 50 cad just to even glance at the Taj Mahal.,csbqzu,,false,/r/india/comments/csbqzu/what_the_heck_is_up_with_the_foreign_rates/,AskIndia

The problem is my dad is extremely frustrated with conditions in India - every little thing irks the hell out of him. Milk price went up by single digit rupees, he is angry, the underpaid maid asked for a raise - he is angry. The roads are dug up, he is angry, the plumber asked more than what he expected - he is angry. Modi demonetized, he is angry.  The neighbors work two jobs (husband and wife) and don’t have time to socialize - he is angry. its not like he is short of money, I send a hefty amount every month, but that doesn’t factor into his attitude. Everyday I get messages about the deplorable living conditions and 360 degree greed everywhere. He wants to move to the US and stay with me, this is simply not possible because of several practical and logistic reasons which he doesn’t get. Each time I raise the topic of me moving back, he amps up his complaints about living conditions in India. My question to you folks, are any of your parents in such a situation ? For those of you whose parents once served in the military or lived in organized townships, what’s your experience like and how did you handle it ? Are things really so bad for seniors ?

1. Wow! Thank you all for the advice and suggestions! Some of them have really started a new trail of thoughts for me - so thank you!
2. Many of you have suggested bringing them to the US and have them experience the reality of life here - they have been to the US over 15 times and have spent upwards of 4 months each visit.

My parents are in their late 50s and we currently covered by National Insurance. We got it via an agent when I was a kid.

Now when I took over for paying premiums and managing it, I realised that premium is way too high for the coverage (which is totally crap).

I wish to switch the insurer now. I have been researching a bit about it pn Policy Bazaar but confused on few factors.

- What all things I should keep in mind when purchasing an insurance?  
- What are the red flags and key pointers?  
- Will existing diseases, if any, will be covered? If no, then how to deal with it?  
- Some policies provide dental as well as OPD cover as well. Shall I opt those for a little higher premium?  
- Where can I check their claim to settlement ratio and other customer reviews (because the official government website is ugly and chaotic af)  
- How much cover shall I go for (current one is just 1 lac for me and mom, 1.5 for dad)?
- Any other suggestions?

I worked at my second company for 3 and a half months (they turned out to be highly unethical). I then took a break for a couple of months and then joined my current company where it has been 2 months.

I had been in touch with my first employers and recently we were discussing a product if theirs that was about to be launched. They got really impressed with my suggestions and offered me to rejoin. 

We discussed the idea. The package was fair but when I asked for a better job title, they said that it wasn't reasonable as I haven't ever done any ""professional marketing"", I joined without an MBA. It felt like they still didn't have any respect for me.

I would've declined but the work at my current company is not very interesting and more importantly, they have questionable policies, although the people seem fine. I fear that they might just do something like fire me after probation.

I don't want to miss an opportunity and regret later. They've offered a decent package without any screening. From my experience, it's difficult getting one without a brand name. Also, I'm comfortable with the place.

She said she misses her dolls so I got her a few Indian Barbies and some markers and a coloring book. I'm not sure what else I should send her and am looking for gift ideas in the future. 

More info: I live in the States so our contact for right now is limited to video chats and phone calls. She is the oldest of three siblings and is a very good big sister from what I’m told so I kinda assume anything I get her she will probably end up sharing with her siblings as well as some of the kids in the orphanage.

So far I got her some Indian barbies, coloring books with washable markers and crayons, and a jewelry making kit.

Somethings I’ll probably save for a later:

From time to time I come across people who are vehemently oppose the presence of missionaries in India because missionaries are forcing people to convert to Christianity. While a most of these people are just repeating a narrative fed to them by whatsapp and right wing agenda, they do present out data that increase in population. I just want to know if there is any truth to it? Are / Were missionaries out there forcing people to convert to Christianity?  


Now that I have posed the question out to you guys. I want to give you my opinion and background. I am an engineer and work mostly in the Northeast States. My work mostly has to do with providing electricity to places who do not have electricity yet. In the past two years I have been to places where there was nothing, non existent roads, lines of communication, and have seen people with very few means, they mostly live on their own micro-economy. I am talking about the deepest of villages in the jungles. It takes us an over hour to cover 10kms in modified off-road vehicles. They had a church in every and each of the community. It was fascinating to me. The missionaries were there providing education, health services to poeple decades before the government. Nothing against the government either, it is not easy even now, i guess it wasn't then either. But coming back to the topic, when i talk to the locals, they say if not for the missionaries, they'd still be hunting down each other. From what I've seen on ground, christian missionaries have done a lot of good in terms of providing education and working on ground more than we have in these remote areas. I'm guessing people converted into Christianity seeing the good work they had done?  


Is the narrative of forced conversions even a thing? Also, i get there are bad apples everywhere and i am hoping there are people of the missionaries who are abusing the locals too. Please provide good links news to instances of abuse. I'd like to get a 360 perspective.  


Please forgive any mistakes in my grammar and spellings. I am on the road right now and won't be able to proof read this. I'm intrigued on what the Indians of Reddit have to say.",cvkfpr,,false,/r/india/comments/cvkfpr/discussion_on_forced_conversions/,AskIndia

1566805115,3003taxwoes,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cvkuqq/recommendations_please_need_an_i5_laptop_with_ssd/,14,13,,,Recommendations please! Need an i5 laptop with SSD (around 55k),"Soooo I currently use a Fujitsu AH532 (6GB RAM/750GB HDD/2.4kg/Win8/Core i3 3110M/15.6""/1GB NVIDIA GeForce graphics card - bought for 30k in 2013). It's been going strong for six years, but it slows down and freezes quite a bit and when the laptop hangs when I'm in the middle of a call, it's super embarrassing. Sometimes it's snappy, sometimes it's slow, and honestly the amount of time I spend waiting is causing me to not be able to do the work I need to which is just causing me to lose money.

Use: I work online and type a lot. I also make voice and video calls every day, and need to have at least three to five Chrome tabs open (I use Google Docs a lot and am basically far more comfy with Chrome than Firefox or Opera). I'll often have two Chrome windows open side-by-side. I sometimes edit (basic) videos for my Youtube channel (I definitely need a new laptop if I'm gonna record, edit and upload vids somewhat regularly). I do edit pictures but I use Paint, not Photoshop. I sometimes play The Sims and some online flash games. I expect my future laptop to perform well for at least ~7 years.


**Things I need:**

* Good battery life is important! My current laptop lasts for just 1.5 hours (it wasn't always this way). I'd say I need at least 3 hours. If I wanted to travel and took my laptop along, I would need it to work for at least 3 hours, I'm guessing. 
* Weight: Ideally under ~1.8KG. Not more than 2KG.
* Screen: at least 13.3"". I don't really care about thinness though.
* It shouldn't be flimsy, although I am very careful and have never dropped my laptop.
* 8GB RAM at least! Should be expandable to 12GB at least, so there's some future-proofing. Do I need more than 8GB right now?
* SSD, preferably 512GB (I'm assuming that's better than 256GB? Please correct me if I'm wrong). Don't need HDD storage, I can just get an external HD for my files.
* At least two USB ports
* Needs to have a good microphone although I will be using earphones/headphones all the time. Don't care about speaker quality because I almost never play anything out loud on my laptop.


**Nice to have but not essential:**

* A backlit keyboard.
* A good webcam. I guess I could just buy an external webcam though.
* A metal body/finish would be reeaalllyyy nice lol I'm so tired of black
* MS Office - could just download it lol


I've been eyeing this one for a few days: http://dl.flipkart.com/dl/asus-vivobook-14-core-i5-8th-gen-8-gb-512-gb-ssd-windows-10-home-x412fa-ek295t-thin-light-laptop/p/itmfg9ysqkkzw8qc?pid=COMFG9YRK28R4GKW&amp;cmpid=product.share.pp


Pros:

* 512GB SSD
* Looks nice
* Weight
* Windows 10
* Fingerprint sensor 
* i5 8265 Processor
* Illuminated keyboard! (I could definitely use this since my current laptop doesn't have it)
* Price (49k)

Cons:

* I've read that the screen isn't good and that the audio quality isn't great.
* ""HD webcam"", what's that? Why won't they describe it in megapixel terms lol
* RetailNet seems to randomly make delivery to my area unavailable, so if I tried to buy it from a store I'd likely have to pay full price
* No MS Office 

Another one I found:

This one looks pretty great too! After a coupon it's for 45k. What a steal deal!

Pros:

* Price
* Storage - SSD plus HDD!
* Screen size
* i5 8265 Processor
* Windows 10


Cons:

* 0.3MP camera
* No fingerprint sensor
* Weight? No idea. Some places say 2kg which I think is a bit much
* No illuminated keyboard
* No MS Office

When I drink it,  it tastes like nothing.  No taste. It's as if there's very less artificial sugar used in it. Is it normal? I've never used ON before.


Edit :-
Further details,  the aroma is very strong,  it's so much like dark chocolate,  and there is a mild after taste.

If all the above info isn't enough,  I can attach photos of it.  There's no importer's seal on it because I didn't buy it from here.  It's from the US, but there are still chances of it being fake.  There are no spelling mistakes or so.  The container looks exactly like the website of ON describes. I'm actually very used to concentrate whey proteins and Indian supplements too.  Could that be the reason why the taste is bland to me?

EDIT:- guys I just had a look at a few reviews of people in India and even of those outside India and many of them said it tastes like bitter chocolate and has a very mild taste and they said that one should instead opt for flavours like extreme milk chocolate,  coffee etc. Even my views on the taste are the same so I guess it's pretty individualistic.  I feel like throwing this in trash can but I'm not rich enough. Anyways,  I'll ignore the taste,  the quality compensates for it.  :)


EDIT:- I'm 100 percent convinced,  mine is original.

Another option I saw was buying a SIM card through SimRaj, an online Indian sim service that delivers your prepackaged sim card when you arrive at the airport.

I am finally getting admission this year to complete my studies after all that Jamela happened.

I belong to middle class family so I have to get education loan to pay for my fees so I went to the bank for lone as adviced by the college  but almost all national banks declined our loan saying that we need some fixed assets for lone as security.

So I again visited the college and they told me that managers of banks do this to keep their records clean as unpaid loans may harm their Grades.

They also told me that according to laws of Education any student who wants an Edu. loan upto 4 lakhs don't need to show any kind of security and he can get loan from any government or private bank any time he wants. Is that true ?

College gave me this page stating the law and told me to show this to bank manager to get the loan. https://i.redd.it/o5u2hz0smnd31.jpg

Now, I've been to several different halls in my undegrad and there are a few different people who are assigned this responsibility in each one of them. If they're not busy chatting, they usually come around every once in a while and refill the water jugs. And that's about it. 

But this guy continuosly hovers around the entire length and breadth of the mess with an eye not only on the water jugs but also on the glasses. If he spots an empty glass, he approaches the person and kindly asks them if they need it to be refilled. Keep in mind that this is not a part of his job and the other workers at the same mess don't feel the need to do the same.

And that's not all. The other day I dropped my glass on the floor as soon as I sat down for lunch. Being the lazy ass I am, I didn't bother to get a fresh one and went on to use the same one. On he comes in a flash and advises me to use this fresh glass that he just brought from the counter as soon as he noticed me drop the glass. During breakfast, he often brings people ketchup bottles if he feels they missed to take it. Again, none of this is a part of his job as no other worker in the mess does this.

But the quality I admire about him the most is that he always wears a very genuine smile on his face that really warms your heart. If you're having a bad day, the look of content on his face is bound to make you see the bigger picure and calm your nerves. 

I learned that it's his birthday next week and decided to gift him something. We've never had the ritual of exchanging gifts on birthdays in our family, so I don't really know the kind of stuff you gift older men. Plus, he comes from a very different economic background and I don't want it to be something that's not useful for him.

I need your help! I had paid for an order of customized ThinkPad laptop from the Lenovo website some 30 days ago. My invoice says that the delivery time for customized items is 17 days. When I heard nothing from Lenovo during this period, I contacted their customer care who informed me (in email) that the standard delivery time is usually 2-3 weeks. Around the end of 3rd week, I emailed back expecting to get delivery details, I was informed that the standard delivery time is 3-4 weeks. We exchanged many emails where I tried to ask about the reason for delay and implored them to commit to a date for delivery in order for me to plan my work and activities accordingly but no one from the customer care made any commitments and just told me that my complaint (Not order) is still under processing.

Defeated, I asked for refund so that I can buy another laptop as they are refusing to commit to a date to which they promptly replied saying that orders once placed cannot be cancelled.

Today is 30th day since order placement and I have no clue when I will get the delivery and I don't even know where to seek help.  I cannot afford to go without a laptop any longer and as Lenovo has refused to refund the money I do not know how to tackle this situation? My query at consumerhelpline to seek remedy in such a situation hasn't been answered in a week now.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? What kind of rights does a consumer have in such a situation? I feel angry, tired and vengeful going through those emails, complaining on twitter and consumer care number again and again. I just want to get my money back and take my business somewhere else!!!

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Ordered customized laptop from Lenovo Website, order was supposed to be delivered in 17 days but I have no information on delivery date even 30 days post order. Customer care has refused to refund. 

Is there any legal provision by which I can destroy their business for showing such apathy towards me? /s",cklwll,,false,/r/india/comments/cklwll/seeking_remedy_for_delayed_laptop_delivery/,AskIndia

While it hit all of us hard, I was the closest to him and it hit me a lot more. Even though my husband supported me, it has taken me a while to get out of a depression of sorts and I now find that my brothers have been working hard to get all the property and documents in their name.

My dad did not have a will and upon his passing, it was suggested that we ""legally"" get a distribution done. So I have a document from a court stating that everything will be divided in 4 parts - for my mother, two brothers and myself. Since dad's death, my brothers have not been treating my mom very well and my husband and I have asked my mom to move in with us. My mom's now telling us of stories of how my brothers might already have transferred all of our properties and business to their name.

I am extremely saddened over how things have progressed but am finally waking up to the state of affairs and find that I need legal help.

Any thoughts on how I can proceed? If there is a better group I should post this in, please let me know.

But assuming that I take the risk and buy VU anyway, my main question is how's the upscaling of this TV does the SD channels look good or ok enough to watch compared to LG, SONY and Samsung?

Is there any one who owns both  brands  Vu and SONY/LG/Samsung, hows the  upsacaling of VU compared to the other 3 brand?

&amp;#x200B;

Also as my budget is only 50k so I am afraid that the lower end of these sony...etc tvs would  not be that great or there MUST be some major compromise to make these TV cheap that i'll regret after buying them.

TLDR :- 1.Buy entry level Samsung/sony/LG tv or High end VU premium android TV

2.Does VU upscale the SD channels as good as the other  brands or alteast watchable enough from 8 feet approx?

Also should I wait for any other TV that is going to release soon or this is a good time to buy a TV?

THANK YOU

EDIT: Got the LG nanocell 49inch for 65k, man that TV is beautiful, such great picture quality, also my friend got himself VU and said the upscaling is not at all good only 4k pictures look damn good, now his parents are mad at him because the cable looks shit on it, not bragging my main concern was upsacling because this TV would mostly be used by my parents and that sweet upscaling really helps even the sd channels to look better. I am glad I went with LG, not hating on VU or anything just thought people should know about the upscaling, also I think VU is more for US, who mostly watch Netflix and such or play games and all, Because damn that TV too looks beautiful, just the upscaling is bad.",cks896,,false,/r/india/comments/cks896/best_tv_atm_under_50k_budget_50_inch_mostly/,AskIndia

While doing my research for my trip, I came across [a travel advisory by my government](https://travel.gc.ca/destinations/india) which states that I should avoid travel in Northeast India due to left-wing insurgency. Looking at the rest of these warnings, it seems that they are being extra safe by listing anything that may carry a risk, like states that border Pakistan in case a conflict breaks out between India and Pakistan over Kashmir.

I really wanted to visit Northeast India but I am [somewhat worried](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurgency_in_Northeast_India). Would it be safe for Canadian tourists to travel there? If there is a risk, what are the chances like? If the timing matters, I will probably end up in the Northeast around late January.

I liked the place culture wise, friendly and flexible.

They didn't try to retain me at all when I quit.

I worked at my second company for 3 and a half months (they turned out to be highly unethical). I then took a break for a couple of months and then joined my current company where it has been 2 months.

I had been in touch with my first employers and recently we were discussing a product of theirs that was about to be launched. They got really impressed with my suggestions and offered me to rejoin. 

We discussed the idea. The package was fair but when I asked for a better job title, they said that it wasn't reasonable as I haven't ever done any ""professional marketing"", I joined without an MBA. It felt like they still didn't have any respect for me.

I would've declined but the work at my current company is not very interesting and more importantly, they have questionable policies, although the people seem fine. I fear that they might just do something like fire me after probation.

I don't want to miss an opportunity and regret later. They've offered a decent package without any screening. From my experience, it's difficult getting one without a brand name. Also, I'm comfortable with the place.

I have MBA too in planning, hopefully to join by next year. But I need to decide on this offer now. I'm also nervous about quitting so soon at my current company.",csse6m,,false,/r/india/comments/csse6m/former_company_offered_to_rejoin_conflicting/,AskIndia

This shouldn't be something that is decided over the opinions of anonymous strangers on the internet but I look forward to listening to your personal experience and understand what it truly means to be a doctor or an engineer. I've only ever heard the biased opinions of a few people and lack the insight to properly make a judgement on either of those professions. I will start by giving some background of myself.

I scored 85% on boards and 333 in neet and did not attempt jee. I am not a studious person and my strategy is to slack off all the time and study in the end. My father kept pushing me into becoming a doctor and that's why I gave the exam. I don't have an ambition of my own. I always avoided thinking about my future, I don't know why. Now I have joined a repeaters course for neet prep. I don't know why but Now I suddenly came to my senses and started questioning why I'm doing this. If I'm going to work hard for 10 years then I should be able to get a job 9-5 job with weekdays off right? But a friend of mine said his father (doctor) works 80 hours a week. I can't work hard for 10 years just to keep working hard for the rest of my life. So I've been thinking what if I switch to engineering and tech based career options. Well most of the colleges have been filled but there are some vacancies. With my marks I can make it to tier 2 colleges at best. With the current state of engineering in our country and the stiff competition for jobs I doubt that I will get a satisfying job with a good work life balance as companies will try their best to maximise profit by making you work overtime and if you refuse there is always another person who is waiting in line for that job. 

As for my interests it has always been anime, video games, tv shows and browsing the internet (imageboards and forums). Very few people have common interests with me but my friends are awesome regardless of whether they like what I like. I'm an introvert. I don't have many big plans for life and I usually find happiness in trivial things like watching a good show and reading a good book. No intention to start a family, at least for now.

3. Most refrigerators do not have this problem because the pan rests right on top of compressor and the idea is that heat from compressor should evaporate any water collected in the pan. No idea why it's not working in this case.

I am the only child of my parents who are very traditional and fear Societal values as much as they fear God's wrath. Despite their idiosyncrocies, they have raised me well, helping and encouraging me at almost every point in my life. To them, and to a lot of people in my family I am the typical example of diligent kid who had made their parents proud. Pretty good grades in High school, got into IIT, went abroad for Masters in Ivy Uni and currently working in one of the most prestigious companies in the world in USA etc etc. However, behind all that pomp and show there are some dark secrets that I have never told anyone who knows me to the  the slightest.  For example, that I have liked guys from my high-school years and have had many experiences even with a number of my tutionmates,  had a FWB relationship with a guy during my Eng which was strictly limited to the time when lights were off etc . And now that I am in the ""Land of the heathens"" (as they call cali in south), one can imagine how my typical weekend look like! Everything very discreet for obvious reasons. Of course, all this secrecy and cloaks also means that I have not had even one single meaningful or emotionally satisfying relationship in almost entirety of my life. Thus, my overly reliance on my family for the emotional support.

Anyways, now that, according to my parents and other relatives,  I am approaching the ripe age of marriage. They have started sending me marriage proposals of various girls on almost weekly basis. Till now, I have kept postponing all these discussions by giving excuses like ""Abhi settle hone do"" etc. etc but all that has stopped working for some time now.

The thing is I am not sure, what should I do. From my perspective, I have following reasons to marry:

1. One does need a partner (even if it was non-sexual)  to spend the life with eventually
2. I do need to think about my parents physical and emotional well-being. They will be devastated if I did not marry and for surely will die if they got to know that their son in homosexual. (I know it is regressive thinking from their part and their emotional devastation is probably their only fault for being bigots but in the end they are my parents and even if they are regressive I do not want to lose them; this is the reality I live in).
3. As for the girl, may not be the best deal for her but she will getting a much higher quality of life than wherever she would've eventually married (She'd have had an arranged marriage anyways).

Now the reasons not to marry:

1. Well, I am gay, so I will never be able to attracted towards my wife the way I am attracted to a guy. This has some chance being picked up by her and might be emotionally draining.
2. I should not be sacrificing my life to preserve the regressive thinking and obviously bigoted societal honour of my parents. (This is easy to say but really hard to do though)
3. Finally, I might be committing myself (and possibly my wife) to a lifetime of inadequate sexual intimacy. This to me seem like a grave injustice to the girl who will be marrying me with a number of hopes and dreams.

As, you can see most of my 'for' reasons are very utilitarian in nature while 'against' are more of moral objections. I turn to the wisdom of r/india hivemind because I am afraid that due to my inexperience and emotional immaturity I might have missed some very obvious issues when trying to think through it.  Unfortunately, due to the sensitiveness and far-reaching implications,  I have no one else to discuss this but you people :(",csy3kr,,false,/r/india/comments/csy3kr/i_need_your_advice_people_living_in_us_closeted/,AskIndia

So I thought you guys might be a big help in recommending a nice city/place to move out.

So first my background, I'm a digital artist from eastern India(hehe, that is all).

Here are my requirements(for cities/places):

* Please no big cities like Delhi, Mumbai, and similar ones.
* ~~good~~ Very good Internet connection(Must)
* Low/No pollution, like come on I want to breathe fresh air.
* Considering I hate summer and its heat, it would be nice if city/place is not in southern India.
* Quality of life (considering above facts)

Many of you might ask why not your hometown(city), well I lived here for almost 20 years and did not got the chance to explore other parts(even though I know not many things are different) of India(except few times where I crossed my state borders), so I thought this is might be the chance to go for it.

I plan on living minimalistic, even right now I don't need anything more than my laptop(&amp; internet)+drawing tablet, but off-course there is food(at-least I'm learning to cook)/sanitation/sleep/gym to consider. And I also plan to do many things I was not able to do bc of living with parent like swimming/skating/hiking and lots of traveling.",csydu8,,false,/r/india/comments/csydu8/citiesplaces_recommendation_for_moving_out/,AskIndia

Or 2. Pokara and the Annapurna circuit in Nepal. 

I am leaning toward India’s route but am concerned about the road conditions/weather. Do you think the roads will be passable from Mcleod ganj to manali? And from manali to spiti valley?

Also, any more insight into this decision would be great.

About me: I am a 26M that is well travelled and fit. I enjoy the “true,” raw experience and want to avoid crazy tourism/crowds. That said, I do want camaraderie among other backpackers and friendly locals - especially me going solo. My timeline is roughly mid September to late October.

 I really want to find a chilled out town with beautiful Mountain Views where I can practice yoga and drink beer/chat with locals and fellow travelers with the mountains in view! (Is this vashisht?)

*to his friends. (Not their)

Its a case of my asshole father tracking the location of my good brother though his political and police links. My good bro ran away from home because family members are mostly toxic.

Before running, my brother did not tell this to anyone except me because my parents are very irritating and annoying and would call him again and again.

So I issued SIM cards to my bro in my name. He then ran away to other city. Has a job now and life is average except the police stalking part.

My brother is in contact with me through Wire app and he says something is shady as he saw police officers around him (more details he told me but can not tell them here). He is feeling very frustrated right now as all he needs his freedom from assholes as his earning money part is going well.

My father asked me if I got new SIM cards. This is a clear indication that he went to his Senior IPS friend and asked him to check my SIM Card history.

So the question is, by doing these surveillance  favours to their friends, are senior police officers of levels like IG, DIG and DGP doing something illegal and punishable?

I have heard they need an official permission from some authority.

As an other story..
I once got a threat when I trolled a Jaat from haryana on phone. He said his friend is an IG in police and he will now track my location and slap me hard. Now the question is not whether I trolled him or not.. yes I did and there is nothing wrong in it.

The question is if our IPS officers are doing something illegal/wrong by extending these favours?

Edit 1 : If this is illegal, what can I do now to see this senior IPS officer suffer for his actions?

Edit 2 : Before going, my brother messaged my father to not track his location through his police links. Still my asshole father tried to track him.

Also African Union jobs aren't just in Somalia, they are all over ***

These companies are getting richer from Indians who know English and technology well, but they are paying $200 a month in India for jobs that people in the U.S. make $45k to $60k a year.   I work in IT and am originally from on Somalia, we have some Indian influence and share words with people from India.  I especially don't like it when H1B sponsoring companies abuse Indians by paying them $25/HR inside cities in my state in the U.S. for ""Programmer"" jobs.  This is crazy because developers earn more than $40/HR average so these evil companies are taking advantage of intelligent human beings from India all because India like most of th world has a lot of poverty.

I just saw tech support job advertising $200/month when I converted the rupee currency to USD.  If they advertised this in my home country of Somalia, I would so no accept this crap.  I myself make $60k a year in tech support/IT.  I live comfortably in the US with it.  But how do I know people in India are living comfortably and making enough money to support the needs of themselves and their families and getting retirement benefits? I don't. 

No one knows, because these companies are abusing human being of the world since they are not subject to US employment laws because they are hiring for jobs inside India.  They don't play fair.  I spend  about$200 a month on food at Darbar Grill which is an Indian restaurant in Minneapolis.  I am shocked to find out companies like Dell that I work directly with, posting jobs in India for $200/month.

My side gig Uber, I once drove an Indian developer from NY and he told me he just accepted a development job for $25/hr.  He came to my city from NYC just to accept such low paying developer job all because he had an H1B.  Food delivery drivers like DoorDash and UbetEats make that $25/hr delivering food.  An educated smart Indian man should never have to accept that low pay crap for a developer job while th H1B Visa consulting agency charges $150/HR to the client.

India being a smart nuclear powerful nation.  Should contact US government to inform them that Indian citizens are being abused by H1B Visa companies and being made to work for $25 or less at software engineer jobs.   

There was even a case of Indians being flown in to setup entire new networks, servers etc etc for a company that was moving to a new building, and they were only paid $1.75/HR all because India incomes were poor.  They later had a lawsuit  against them, and they repaid the Indian tech workers the money that is equivalent to an on-shore citizen.  Just because Indians are foreign doesn't mean thes companies should be treating them subhuman.

The family across the house has two teenage children, their parents and the fathers mother. The old grandmother sits in a chair at their door everyday and stares into our house every time the door opens. Before I moved in, the son led by his mother had tried to imply that the women living there before were running a brothel - why because they had 'boys over for parties.' After I moved in, we have been especially cordial, helping them in anyway we can, stopping to talk to them, offering to hold packages and parcels - anything a good neighbour would do. We have barely ever had parties especially because we're both too tired most days to even have the energy to host anyone. we're both in long-term committed relationships so yes boyfriends do visit but we pay a hell lot of rent and cause no nuisance, shouldn't be a problem right?

&amp;#x200B;

A friend of mine is going abroad for his PhD and we had some people over yesterday, not more than 9 people. At one point someone who hadn't visited the house stood between doors and peeped into the neighbours house and ours to see where we were (the doors face each other) and was suddenly accosted, pushed and abused by the man because 'he dared to enter the house' - he didn't. Immediately, because of his language and because he said he'd call the police (getting angrier because friend was okay with the idea and said the police should be called) things got loud and I step outside to have the grandmother scream at me in punjabi about how I had men in the house and have no shame. The whole problem was really me and my flatmate being close to 30 and being unmarried. This is a prime area in the capital of the city. She then calls the RWA president who wa filthy, vulgar and went batshit crazy because 'friend-going-for-PhD' hugged a woman as he saw her off into an uber - that's it. She lost her shit at a hug. We tried to talk to her as calmly as possible even having to request that she give us ten seconds to talk but her entire monologue was vulgar, aimed at trying to shame us, accuse us of things we definitely have never done and asking us to leave the complex several times - 'we're not family type'. Also then sent in a guard to tell us to finish the party and that if it's not over the police will be called. We continued and no police was called. It would have been better if they were - we are all over 25, so the bottles of alcohol weren't a problem and we were literally just sitting around in the living room and talking, not even too loud. oh and turns out they're going through our trash - they found condoms and cigarette butts and were sitting on that piece of information waiting for a day like this to tell us - THEY LITERALLY HAVE SOMEONE CHECKING TENANTS TRASH. Luckily we have great landlords who don't stay in the city - who were highly supportive and spoke to us over the phone. They asked us not to worry and at the same time told us to try and lot any complaint reach them - but we didn't even do anything!

&amp;#x200B;

I work really hard, am studying alongside, definitely a better neighbour  than the 'holier-than-thou-people with families' and yesterday I had some garbage pile of a woman try and teach me what shame is and another woman ask me to leave my lodging because someone who 'wasn't my brother' was in my house. These sad-ass-pieces of shit leave doors and windows open so they can watch our lives like a tv show , waiting for something to pounce upon. I am so SO angry right now and so upset I can barely focus on anything at all.

This was harassment. I know this happens all over this shit country  and a woman paying her rent, doing her job and living a happy life as a mature adult is incomprehensible but this unhappiness they have with their lives just threatened my safety and security in my own house and I find it unacceptable. I don't want to rock the boat in a losing battle but at the same time find it hard to tell myself to keep quiet and let this go. Just needed to get this out, right now. I can't wait to get back home because if I get spoken to by the RWA president or the family one more time, they way they spoke to me yesterday, they're going to get a giant piece of my mind.

Is any of this acceptable? What would you be doing in my place?

&amp;#x200B;

**Update**: Thank you so much! The support and advice here has been amazing and so helpful! We've discussed CCTV cameras and definitely going to be putting one at our door. Hopefully will help things a bit but we'll have to wait and see. The mother went to neighbours in the area and I could here her talking about us. Hopefully this ends at being us being fodder for aunty-gossip, the thread has been super helpful in also making me realise I need to not give too much of a damn about what people think. 

legally, with this advice, we're in a better place to handle things if another escalated situation takes place, if it does come to that. The landlord is visiting us next week so will also be discussing things with him in person. Will keep you guys updated.

It was manipulative, toxic, I wanted to breakup, she said if I can't handle her I should leave so I told I want to breakup, again she went crazy, she said she will kill herself and put the blame on me because I am breaking up without any reason and trying not solve the problems, again I started begging her and told her we will meet and solve the issues. We met, I told her about the problems, she also told how she felt, we decided we will solve the problems and try to get into a relationship if everything goes okay, it went well for 2 weeks, I spent the entire weekend with her, I thought she was enjoying it, last week she said she misses sexting and went to see the messages from her ex, I got angry I said if you are serious about this relationship as you say you would have told me that you missed that or atleast read our messages but you went to him, she again went crazy because I said ""you went to him"", she wanted to breakup because I was a bad boyfriend, I was not okay with PDA, I can never be crazy about someone, she got pissed when I said okay when she said we should breakup, again suicidal threats, I completely brokedown and cried and wanted to die, she calmed down. I talked to couple of psychiatrist they said she might be suffering from Borderline personality disorder and its not my responsibility to be her guardian, I met her 2 days back, begged her to come to Psychiatrist and I will pay for everything, she said no she only wanted a boyfriend, I said no and we brokeup. Today she says I am the one who is to blame because I used her and did not love her and she will punish herself for loving me, I said I will take steps to save two lives, she said she will kill herself if I went to cops or talked to her friends or parents about her psychiatric conditions, I was scared so I asked her to promise she won't take any stupid decisions so I won't got to police. No she said stay away from me and blocked me. What should I do please help me with next steps? What if she actually kills herself?

So I am a 27-year-old who is a graphic designer by profession. I have been in this domain for 4 years and I can say I am alright at it. I am definitely not extremely good, but the last two places I worked, they were genuinely happy with my work. I got into this field in a weird way. I always liked to tinker with digital art, photography, etc. and I got a job as a designer straight out of college. Since then, I have worked in this field because I thought it was my passion and it was the only thing I could do to pay my bills. The more I worked in this field, the more I began to dislike graphic design. Over time, it became more of a chore for me. That's when I realized I am not passionate about it and just am in the field just because I have been in it for a while and I have some sense of design. For example, when I was working with a few brands, I just wanted to get the project over with so I can have some peace of mind. There was a lot of room for improvement but I didn't suggest it because more work for me. In the same train of thought, I am more than happy to be told what to do, and I will do it. Many passionate designers I met are completely against that idea. They want to give their own input and genuinely want to help their clients improve, but for me, it's just another deadline that needs to be done with. I also realized, if I have to compete with top designers to get better jobs, I have to improve my skills. Now, I would happily do it if I was genuinely passionate about it, but I know I am not.

I quit my last job in June and have been surviving on my savings since then and now it seems to be running out. Since, June, I was so happy that I don't have to wake up and do this shitty job. I still tinker around with digital art and have fun doing it and that's when I realized I began hating my hobbies because of this job. I am old now to understand this passion and drive I cannot cultivate in this field for sure. Now I have to look for a job. Realistically, I can work for any ad agency or even try my hand out with Amazon (I have already worked with them) or some other corporate where I could get paid a decent amount for some donkey job where I don't have to think much, etc. but I am feeling I will go back to hating my life and work again. I am okay with a boring 9 to 5 job even if it is some mind-numbing work, as long as the pay is alright and timings are decent. I don't expect the perfect life anyways, but I feel I need to change this.

Can any of you give me some solid career advice on this aspect? Should I just suck it up and continue working in this field especially when I am not passionate about it? I feel the only way I can make significant leaps in this field is my striving to constantly improve myself, but to do that, I need to genuinely love the work, which I don't. If not, what other options do I have? Some of my friends were telling me to get into hospitality since I am pretty good at talking to people and managing things and it also has a scope of me to go abroad (which is a long term plan for me). I feel going abroad bit will be severely hindered by graphic design because it's not a that sought after field with which I can move abroad.

If you would suggest I stay in graphic design, are there any schools or courses that can help me? I am a fully self-taught designer so I have never had a proper foundation of design sense and style. I had a helpful mentor in my last job, and he kept telling me don't go for studies in this field, just keep working and you will improve. I learned a lot from him in terms of my work improving and all.

Other than this, are there any other jobs or fields you would suggest?

I started following the advice I have found on other similar questions and already joined a gym. I am average looking guy, tall and can grow a decent beard. I do have spectacles and I think it makes me look older than my age with my hair(I don't know how old I will after shaving my head). I am also not very bold and not a conventionally ""strong and cool"" guy. 

Now, in our Indian society, anything even slightly diverging from the norms is looked down upon and made fun of and villains are also portrayed as bad guys many times.

 I want to know what situations and comments I will have to face from people(family, friends, etc)?

-----------

""Traditionally, Diwali is celebrated over the course of five days. On the first day, many housewives spend the day cleaning their dwellings from top to bottom and then running out to purchase kitchen items or items crafted from gold.

On the second day, homes are often decorated with clay lamps called diyas and their floors adorned in intricate patterns using colored sand.

The third day is marked by a Lakshmi puja, or prayer to Lakshimi, which is then followed by a feast where many different types of foods are consumed. Afterwards, there is often a firework celebration.

On the fourth day, family and friends gather to give each other their best wishes for the season and to exchange gifts.

The final day is when brothers visit their married sisters where they are greeted with a joyous welcome and served a hearty feast.""

Why do Hijras go to gurus for loans?

Are many Hijras caught in shark loans with gurus being the lender?

Even if Hijras are caught in a shark loan why do these Hijras continue to stay with the Gurus?

Why would a Hijra leave a community with a guru?

Are there any organizations in India to help these people?",cmvhvy,,false,/r/india/comments/cmvhvy/transgendershijras_in_india/,AskIndia

I chose this course out of my own will even though i had better options (jee main 2018 rank -23669) because i wanted to study physics or engg physics only but in an iit or iiser or iisc but couldnt score well in advance, so opted for EP at DTU. And my family is what you call a proper middle class family, loans and debts almost equalling my father's income, but neither he nor my mom have ever spent money on themselves, it's just a case of bad planning and management, will make sense in a while. So back to my case, i joined DTU half-heartedly 'kyuki ye IIT nhi tha na'. So i started preparing for jee again, alongside my clg, so i didnt take an education loan in hopes of getting a better clg next year, so no new laptop too, my old one was you could say, on a ventilator (sbi was giving very good ROI-8.9%) but i couldnt balance them and went off balance midway, fucked up both jee and 1st year. Now i am back, stronger and wiser than last year and have been regularly attending classes but the past always haunts you, i started applying for education loan again from in june at the same sbi i mentioned bcos it has a branch in our clg. Went there, had to roam and fetch them documents like a dog for almost half a month, then i went on a vacation for a month (not my fault, was pre decided almost 3 months ago) and when i returned they said my father had made a settlement for credit card some years before, it's like a black mark so they can't provide loan. My father has an avg credit score too. They suggested i better apply on vidyalakshmi portal. I applied to sbi (home branch this time) and pnb, submitted documents again, pnb asked for guarantor, and that was a big no-no, who asks for a guarantor for an education loan less than 7.5 lakhs. Then my father approached icici, they again took abt 10 days and replied 'over commitment of co applicant (my father)' then he approached HDFC credila (nightmare), and when he said that they are asking for repayment during my course itself, i insisted not to go forward, i wanted me to pay all my educational expenses hereafter, he had paid for my schooling and even 1st year and that was enough. But he still went forward, again waited for 10 days, today i receive a message that my loan has been declined (no reason given). The deadline for fees was approaching, till yesterday the fine for late pay was 5k, from today it's 10k, so he paid it yesterday with his credit card and that cost him an extra 2232 apart from 1.66 lakhs+5k late fees. We have booked a laptop by giving 1000 token amount which has to be paid in full till next friday but he's bleeding left and right and i can't help him in any way.

The selection process is group discussion followed by HR interview. I know I can get placed in other companies which offer a job profile of my choice and also offer a higher package but are going to come later, so if I get selected in this, my chances in those basically drop to 0 due to campus rules. I also cannot reject the company or be found underperforming by placement unit or else I can't participate in any further companies.

As far as I know, companies don't share their reviews or reasons for not selecting students with the universities so I am not sure how the uni enforces the underperformance rule. At this point, my best bet will be to stay silent during GD and hope that I don't get selected for the interview but any suggestions from your side will be valuable. Thanks.

3. Budget ~ 10-13k per monitor.  
4. Height adjustment will be a bonus.  
5. Laptop has a 1050ti card. Dunno if that can take advantage of the LG Freesync monitors I see as popular choices on Amazon (60hz vs 75hz for gaming).  
6. I am already using couple of HP monitors, borrowed from a relative. Time to get my own.  
7. Monitors I have considered so far:  
  a. Benq GW2480 : From the reviews sounds like an awesome display for dual setup (slim bezels). Doesn't offer height adjustment. Available for 10k on Amazon.  
  b. Dell P2419H : Much newer model than the Benq. Display appears to be as good as the Benq one (slim bezels too) with added bonus of height adjustment and a USB 3.0 hub. This is on the pricier side of my budget (13.5k on amazon) and is why I am considering other options.  
 c. LG IPS gaming monitors : There are 2-3 I found that seem to be wildly popular on Amazon. I feel like I can opt for Benq instead of LG if the Freesync option doesn't work for my GPU.

Do you know how much does it cost to paint a single room?

I am thinking of replacing the cheap neon light with one of those more advance flat tube lights

also going to put some of the left Diwali lights inside the room, but i don't want to use too many nails and ruin the wall so any idea how to stick them?

&amp;#x200B;

Thinking of buying an aromatic plant to keep on window sill to freshen up the room, any ideas which plant to get?

When I was 8 years old, me and my best friend had falling out over some dumb stuff 8 year olds argue about. I was complaining about it to mom, she said ""Its because he is ST. I asked what does ST mean? She said, it means he is dalit. I asked does dalit mean bad? She said Yes, They are bad people and liars in general. Since that day, I had saved in my head for long time dalits are bad people. I didn't apply it to my friend for some reason or had any clue how to know someone's caste (still don't know surnames).

I noticed whenever he was over in my house, maid would give him tea in a old, broken looking cup.  I didn't like what maid was doing and first wanted to give him my cup and take his but got scared it might be actually too physically dirty. I grabbed better cup and gave it to him. Mom wasn't present during that incident thankfully. I remember later telling mom that my friend is Buddhist and she said he isn't actually Buddhist. He is Hindu and dailts say they are Buddhists to hide the fact that they are all dalits. 

She also constantly makes negative remarks about muslims. She always calls them as mommedians. I don't know if its a slur. She would say things like ""Not mommedian patients again!!!"". ""Mommedians always want to quarrel."" ""We are in a mommedian area, drive carefully."" Makes me sad to think someone is trusting their life with her, while she thinks of them like they are some inferior species. 

I am 21 currently, there was this incident few months ago. I was moving to another city, we were looking for tiffin services on justdial. First result was ""Ali Tiffins"" Mom said to scroll past it. I asked why, they have good reviews and they don't look fake.  She said, they are mommedian. I asked, what's wrong with mommedian? She said ""They live in very uncleanliness and live around goats."" I snapped out and said ""Are muslims even humans? They are all animals, aren't they?"" 

We were looking at skin clinics one day. I was reading her names from Google maps and she kept saying next, next until I read 
 her ""Anshul xxxx"" she looked at it and said ""Oh nevermind, its a female."" I asked what's wrong with being female? She said ""Aaurto mein dam nahi reheta."" She finally kept scrolling till we found a male doctor and took me there.

I always felt guilty growing up, not agreeing with mom on topics like this and many others. Culture around me taught ""Parents are a form of God. You should touch their legs after waking up daily.

If you have fair amount of information on both religions, you would know there are parallels in mythologies. There's a Jain ramayana where Ravana is the hero, Jain mahabharata where Krishna is sent to Hell. Jain universe of God's has striking similarities with Hindu version of same.

The final point of argument I found was that Oldest Hindu scripture - Rigveda has mentions of Jain monks which makes Hinduism a derivative of Jainism. I intuitively believed it was other way round earlier.

I have been out of work for the last three months and after a long time I recently got an offer after the usual push/pull formalities of the hiring process. 

My take home salary in my previous company was 1.2 lacs PM with the CTC being 14 lacs annually. What this company offered me was 10 lacs annualy with the gross coming out to be 80k per month. Before the process started, the consultant told me upfront that the company's budget was 10 lacs annually and at the most they would be able to stretch that to 11.5 lacs annually. 

Since I had been out of work for quite some time, I decided to take the plunge anyway and take the pay cut. After having cleared all the rounds, I was sent the offer letter with the salary break up etc a day before the joining the company. 

Now as I went through the clauses, I noticed two clauses that made me a bit hesitant. 

1. That I would have to return them the joining bonus of 50K if I leave the company before one year. I was to receive the joining bonus after having served 3 months in the company. 

2. That the notice period in the company was 60 days (2 months). 

I couldn't agree with these and I called the HR for clarification. Now this was a day BEFORE I was to join the company and around 7PM. 

1. The HR clarified that if I leave within the first 3 months I wouldn't have to pay it. Now who leaves a company after joining a company within three months?

2. The HR said that this is company policy and there was nothing the he/she could do about it. 

With two other interviews lined up, I decided to not join the company. Though I have a 50/50 chance of getting through the other companies, I however decided it was too risky to join this company. Esp. the two month notice period. 

So /r/india, did I do the right thing? Or did I take too much of a chance. It's been in my head for the last week so just thought I would share it, let it out, and hear your thoughts on this one. 

What would you have done? Should I have just taken the job since I was 'at least' going to get a salary and some money? Also, the consultant calling calling me back, hearing things like I shouldn't have rejected the offer in this economy was too much to hear.",cnxe9o,,false,/r/india/comments/cnxe9o/did_i_do_the_right_thing_for_myself_by_rejecting/,AskIndia

My husband met with an accident on 1/8/2019. He was hit by a 4 wheeler coming from the left road on a junction/square (चौराहा) when he was crossing the square, driving straight on his 2 wheeler. The 4 wheeler guy immediately brought us to the hospital. My husband received first aid and underwent surgery the next day as he broke his left radius and ulna (forearm bones). He will be recovering in 3 months time as per the doctor.

A policeman came to record my husband's statement on a plain A4 sheet. He wrote it in Telugu and someone translated it for us to English. All details were correct. Now, I have a few questions.

1) Since the policeman took the statement, does this mean an FIR has been already filed by us? Or the statement he took was just a statement but FIR will be filed after we agree to filing it?

2) The policeman called us yesterday to collect the FIR (its been a week). Does merely collecting the FIR equate to lodging a case against the 4 wheeler guy? We don't intend to file a case against him as he's ready to pay compensation and we're ready too. (Our family hasn't decided an amount though)

3) Can a filed FIR be withdrawn? How? (General question)

4) Do we need to involve the police while doing the compensation conversation with the 4 wheeler guy, or should it be done outside the police station in private with the guy with no involvement of police?

I request people who have been in road accidents and went through the process to answer these questions. Also, any lawyers or people with knowledge of legal matters, please provide your advice.

A few more details:
* My husband and I are both government officers and our organization took care for all the medical bills. 

* We live in Andhra Pradesh but are not from here.

* The policeman asked for Rs.1000/- when he took the statement. He's asking for Rs.500/- more whenever we'll go to collect the FIR (if we choose to do so).

* My husband will have to undergo another surgery after an year to remove the plates that have been put to position the broken bones.

We were enjoying the food when 3 kids(one boy and two girls) of age between 7-10 years came to the shop. Kids looked poor and had old clothes(colors faded, etc) but they were not beggars for sure. They order their food. Since then owner of the restaurant kept shouting at them to sit in a corner. However these kids got a table which was just parallel to our table and sat there. Kids kept telling the owner ""Aunty hum yahin baithenge"" and waiters kept coming to them and forcing them to go to corner seat. At one point it became so disturbing that I had to ask waiter to stop bothering them. Kids had their food quickly and they left as they had already paid the bill while placing the order. When they were leaving waiters kept taunting them.

Here are parallels from the incident,
1) I could choose any table I wanted to sit but they were continuously asked in threatening tone to sit in corner.
2) Waiter came to our table to take the order but kids had to go to counter to place the order and they payed for it upfront.
3) Nobody disturbed us when we were eating whereas kids were being asked to change the seat and wrap up quickly.
4) We payed our bill and left but no one bothered us but these kids were taunted by waiter.

All this because they were poor? Their clothes were old? This is discrimination in 21st century. I don't know what effect this will have on kids with such a young age but they were not treated well.

And then I do not need to maintain account books being a small business man.

Now my actual profit from business seems to be around 12% (rough calculations) but this year my income from other sources is little more than expected. (due to maturity of some investment)

Which means I need to pay little higher tax.

So instead of showing 12% as business profit .. can I show presumptive income as 10%?

This way my tax liability should decrease.

I do not want to do anything illegal or what can put me in trouble later on.

But if I read section 44AD... only condition is that profit should be atleast 8%.

Since I am showing 10% profit ... it should be fine.

After all the title of section 44AD itself states that it is presumptive income. i.e. I can presume the tax and pay tax on it.

**Can anyone clarify?**

Thank you.

**Update:**

Answer is found in FAQ by income tax india website:

[https://www.incometaxindia.gov.in/\_layouts/15/dit/mobile/faqs/faq-questions.aspx?key=FAQs+on+Tax+on+Presumptive+Taxation+Scheme&amp;k=](https://www.incometaxindia.gov.in/_layouts/15/dit/mobile/faqs/faq-questions.aspx?key=FAQs+on+Tax+on+Presumptive+Taxation+Scheme&amp;k=)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**What is the manner of  computation of taxable business income in case of a person adopting the  presumptive taxation scheme of section 44AD?**  
&gt;  
&gt;​In case of a person adopting the provisions of [ section 44AD](https://www.incometaxindia.gov.in/_layouts/15/dit/mobile/faqs/faq-questions.aspx?key=FAQs+on+Tax+on+Presumptive+Taxation+Scheme&amp;k=#), income will be computed on presumptive basis, i.e., @ 8% of the turnover or gross receipts of the eligible business for the year.

Income  shall be calculated at rate of 6% in respect of total turnover or gross  receipts which is received by an account payee cheque or draft or use  of electronic clearing system.In other words, in case of a person adopting the provisions of [ section 44AD](https://www.incometaxindia.gov.in/_layouts/15/dit/mobile/faqs/faq-questions.aspx?key=FAQs+on+Tax+on+Presumptive+Taxation+Scheme&amp;k=#)​, income will not be computed in normal manner as discussed in previous FAQ (i.e., Turnover     less Expense) but will be computed @ 8%/6% of the turnover.

&gt;Income at higher rate, i.e., higher than 8% can be declared if the actual income is higher than 8%.

In short:

That FAQ perfectly clears my doubt on how I can calculate profit.

1. Not based on turnover minus expense (normal business profit)
2. But based on 6% and 8% (presumptive income)
3. I can declare at higher rate if I want to but it is not compulsory",ctbrp4,,false,/r/india/comments/ctbrp4/section_44ad_can_i_show_less_profit_but_more_than/,AskIndia

Anything hanky panky like open marriage, polyamory, dont ask dont tell, hall pass etc. was unthinkable. 

Cut to today, we are surrounded by people who do practice such marriages (sometimes openly) and some people are into successful open marriages. 

Those, who come from conventional families where the love between parents was strictly monogamous, here are some things I was wondering

1. Do you compare their relationship with yours? 
2. Does your partner come from a similar family background? 
3. If you follow a ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy, do you sometimes wonder who they may be with or get insecure? 
4. If your partner is getting more action than you, do you reconsider the polyamory?

Help me finding a job.,"Hi India, I am a guy from Delhi. I am searching for a job. Whenever I search a job portal like naukri, indeed etc, lots of call center jobs are being showed. What I am asking is - aren't there any other type of jobs available in market other then these call center jobs. If there are please let me know, part time or full time it doesn't matter.

You must be wondering what is wrong with call center jobs. You see I am 24 and do not have a graduate degree. I am pursuing bca from Ignou. I started bca in 2013 but still have 7 backs. I want a job so that I can study while working. These call center jobs are mostly in gurugram and noida and it will take around 2 hrs from my place to reach there. I will not get the time to study if I join there. I live in uttam nagar btw. I was working as an IT recruitment specialist at a consultancy. Where I have to call and tell people all around India about job opportunities and ask them if they are interested and available for the interview. While working over there I learned that that are lot of job opportunities in the market that normal guys like me have no idea about. I left that job of there were targets and lots of pressure. 

If you guys know about any job openings where I can apply and work pressure is not much Please let me know. As I am doing bca so I am good with computers. If I get a call center job near by my place it will also work but couldn't find any. Also if it is part time job or any menial jobs I don't care. If I do not get any other job call center is my last option.

TL;DR: I am want to know for different types of job that are available in market other then call center and if you know about the job opportunity where I can apply please let me know.",ctdhso,,false,/r/india/comments/ctdhso/what_are_different_kind_of_jobs_available_in/,AskIndia

In terms of the skills that I have, I have done some internships at startups related to ML. Besides, I have done Andrew NG's Deep Learning courses on Coursera, was working through CS 231n and CS229 at Stanford  (via their online free materials). I haven't done super great projects but I am working on a research project right now in the field of Computer Vision with a professor at my college (its a private engineering college, not one of the better ones)

I also have taken courses in my college related to Maths that comes handy in ML. These are Advanced Linear Algebra (where I learnt about various norms, SVD, etc.) and Stats (where the main focus was on Time Series). I have a good understanding of the former subject.  I also have read ISLR and done some of its course work on Lagunita.

What are my chances? I have been working on drafting mails to almost every CS professor at IISC and I needed some guidance on that. I want to know how I should prepare for it and what they expect of me. Also, if you were interviewed, how long did it take for your interview? Was it telephonic or Skype based?

Other skills that I have are : Python (great at it), Scikit Learn, TensorFlow, OpenCV (worked with both, know some stuff really well, some not so much), some concepts of Computer Vision like Edge Detection, Connected Components Analysis (but I have not gone super deep into it), Data Structures (so-so), DBMS (pretty good at it, I think)

GPA: Not too great. Barely above a 3.0 (on a scale of 4)

Full Disclosure: I hope to do an MS eventually in CS and I thought doing research might be the best stepping stone for me to go abroad rather than being stuck in a job at an IT company for XYZ years.",ctex7r,,false,/r/india/comments/ctex7r/has_anyone_here_done_a_research_internship_at/,AskIndia

Similar is with club holidays companies., Club Mahindra and country club guys are pure crooks .
In electronics segment , Video con and Godrej are the worst when it comes to after sale services.

Last year , I did house renovation with a so called emerging startup called ' homelane'. The reason I went with them was to  reduce headache which comes when you give contract to civil contractors and local carpenter  in your area. 
I was  kinda impressed when I went to their experience centre and the way their designers proposed the layout of my apartment.They also promised a clause wherein if not completed within 45 days ,I will get refund .

And oh gosh, after I gave them payment. , the circus started and this circus was worser than ever. All of their professional seems to be pure incompetent in their job. They did a worse job  than a local carpenter will ever do.

Severely fucked up my life.,"*Note:This post came out longer than I initially intended it to be so apologies for rambling so much but I've added a tl;dr at the bottom.*

24/Male/12th(commerce) pass, that is who I am right now after having wasted away about 6 years of my life doing essentially nothing. 

You must be wondering what person in their right mind would be stupid enough to be in this position, well thats my problem I've not been in my right mind for the past seven years and have been suffering from depression and anxiety which has only gotten worse over the years. I've had anxiety issues since I was 13 but it was never serious enough to get in the way of my day to day life but when I was around 17 that's when it started getting a bit serious and it started affecting my academics. I was an underachiever throughtout my school life, never put any real effort into my studies but still got off getting somewhat decent marks (~70%), I would procrastinate all the time and would always avoid difficult situations that were out of my comfort zone and simply neglect things that required active participation, but by the time I was 17 things were getting bad and I felt like I was procrastinating a little too much, so much so that maybe I should say it was just straight up escapism, always running away from anything causing me displeasure. Still I managed to get through my boards with again somewhat decent marks and after that I appeared for CA-CPT and cleared that on the first go as well so next I appeared for CA-IPCC and failed. 

Why? Well because my approach of doing the bare minimum and getting by was not working here, so I gave a couple of more attempts and before every attempt I knew I was going to fail because I hadn't studied, I was again mindlessly procrastinating and was creating new personal records for the amount of time that I'm wasting. 

Almost forgot to mention that the reason I don't have an UG Degree is because of my stupid decision to not join a regular college but instead I joined IGNOU's BCom for CA students wherein I get my degree only if I get the required credits after passing IPCC. Looking back that was the most stupid fucking thing that I've done.

After each attempt I would tell myself that I would study sincerely for the next attempt, but I never did and with time passing by I started feeling demotivated and by the time I was 21-22 I actually started feeling depressed because that's when it fucking hit me that I had just wasted away the most precious years of my life doing what? Watching movies,tv shows and surfing the web! I can't put in words how stupid I feel and how much I hate myself, I mean I actually never did anything productive in all those years, I had all the opportunities to make something of my life, didn't have any external forces/circumstances to cripple me, heck even people who are unfortunate enough to have real life problems and have every reason to blame external events/circumstances for failure work hard and turn their life around yet here I am sitting on my fat ass destroying my own life with my own hands. During this time I stopped doing anything, cut off all social contacts and would just pass off days staring at a screen or a wall, even though I didn't do anything the days went by like hours, couldn't tell day from night, time flew by but i was just sleeping with my eyes open the whole time.

At 23 I thought that enough is enough and I have to get my shit together so I did actually started studying again for ipcc and things were actually going good for a couple of months but then my anxiety started trippin again and once again I cracked under pressure and wasted away another year.

Now I'm 24 and in the worst state I've ever been in, both mentally and physically and I want to put my foot down this time and actually do something about my problems and try to fix my life. So I know that at this point I should probably see a therapist to get my mind straight and start exercising to get in a better shape but I still can't figure out what to do in life career-wise?

Now his is the main point of my post, I need your help to figure out what I should do now, I will be joining Bcom again and start afresh so it will take 3 years for me to get a degree by the time I'm 27,that doesn't do much. So I want to ask you kind people to please provide some guidance as to what to do.Although I come from a middle class background I don't have any immediate financial obligations but my parents are getting old so I will have to start earning in the next 3-5 years. 

I have built some self-confidence overtime to say that I can clear Intermediate in May 2020 if I join classes now but I don't know if I should still continue CA as I'm already 24 and I would be appearing for Finals by the time I'm 28-29, but my biggest fear is what if I give my best and still can't clear Finals, then at that age I would be even more fucked. 

If not CA then what? I feel like my chances of getting a decent job in the private sector are pretty much non-existent now given I have SUCH A HUUGE GAP, I don't even know how I would explain this in an Interview. People usually have a valid excuse for a gap, but I don't have a solid explanation for a gap this big.

Then looking at Government jobs gets me thinking too much that although I won't be working slave hours like in the private sector but I will be a sarakari babu for life and all that stuff. I don't know much about govt jobs at all and I never thought of getting one up untill now, I'm super confused.

Man, sometimes reading about people in the west going to college at 25-30 being completely normal makes me wish I could move out of India and start a new life somewhere else. I feel like I've wasted away my chance at a decent job, I have to face reality and accept the consequences of my actions but I don't want to be stuck making pennies at a crappy place for the rest of my life. I don't have any passion or calling towards any particular field right now although I was a bit interested in coding, finance and economics in the past, right now I'm just numb. I live in a Tier-2 city and am willing to move to a different place, but I just don't know what to do?

I come to you r/india as I don't have anyone else to talk to and I don't think I'm in a proper state of mind to figure this out on my own, please help me figure it out.

6. Will getting into companies like Amazon, Facebook be easy in Germany? I think it's not a very big challenge in US. You have to study for sure, but will it be more difficult in Germany?
7. Can anyone please recommend me colleges in Germany and US for Computer Science? I have 2 years of work experience and 9.1 GPA with no publication. I will manage to score  a minimum of 323 in GRE.

The other day, my wife and I were watching [The Farewell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RofpAjqwMa8), and we got talking about Indian movies. I realized she really hadn't seen any good Indian movies. The only one we've watched together was [The Lion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RNI9o06vqo) starring Dev Patel, which was pretty incredible.

When I asked her if she didn't like Indian movies, she basically said that she hasn't found any that weren't the ""Bollywood masala"" type. So I got thinking. I know we have had some incredible artists like Satyajit Ray, so I am sure there are great Indian movies out there that don't fit the stereotype.

So, I am looking for recommendations of good Indian movies - Hindi, Tamil, or Malayalam preferred but happy to watch any other language as well. My wife is not desi, so we'd probably need to watch it with subtitles anyway.

We just have one dealbreaker - it cannot be a Bollywood masala movie with songs/dancing etc. Just looking for a great movie with just the story.

So, what are some good movie recommendations? It can be any genre - drama, action, adventure, comedy. Just looking for something that's not the typical Bollywood masala and with no dance/music sequences.

I am a 27 year old individual. I had dropped out from btech degree back in 2011 due to some financial issues and somehow managed to complete a degree in Bba in 2015. I used to work for some bpo(s) in gurgaon till 2017. During these 2 years i also gave various government exams but couldn't clear any of them. I left my bpo job in 2018 and went for python based data analysis MOOC from udacity.

I have been doing Python and data analysis ever since that day. I don't have a job as of now. I apply to atleast 20 companies per day but none of them have given any kind of response.

My family, my cousins and my father, they all look down on me due to the fact that I couldn't achieve anything in my life even at this age. I used to be very good in studies, have been an obedient kid my whole life plus i always help out people in their grim situations. The problem is that i don't have any friends to talk to and my mother who is from a rural background says that i am a looser who is just a parasite in the house. I cannot tell anyone how much pain i bear each day. Everyday i feel like i should end up commiting suicide. The only thing i love is planting trees and doing python. I find solace in writing lines of code. My father had told me 5 years back that he won't be supportive in any of my further education plans. He also says that i've let him down

  


""Naak kata di hai tuney""

To add insult to the injury, one of my cousin who is a homeopathic doctor cleared the exam for pharmacist post on contractual basis for delhi moholla clinics. For my parents, he's God...the ideal child.... All of these cousins live in my parent's house,under the same roof.

* What should I know and pack from the US that isn't easily accessible on the India?

* What are family friendly activities we should look forward too?

A few months ago they changed the free tournaments to every 2 hours and as of now, they have changed the timings to such an extent that you won't even know when there is a free tournament. I've won and withdrawn 4-5k while losing 100-200 bucks to the site. However, it's not what it used to be and I'm curious to know if there are other genuine sites like this.",cu986g,,false,/r/india/comments/cu986g/does_anyone_know_a_good_online_website_for/,AskIndia

Next step is police verification. Will it happen at both my present and permanent residential address? I presently stay in Chennai and my permanent address is a remote village in Bihar.

I was talking to a friend who teaches in a private school in Uttarakhand. Its not one of the big schools of Dehradun (Doon School, Welham's types), rather a newly opened ICSE school, but it definitely employees more than 50 people (teachers, co-ordinators, maids, guards, etc). She is battling Dengue and when I asked about her medical leaves, she said hers being a private school doesn't provide medical leaves. She only gets 12 leaves an year. So, for the duration of her recovery, she is unpaid.

This got me thinking what happens in these schools when a women delivers a child. She said she had no idea about the provision of maternity leave in her school. I know about the 26 weeks maternity leave law passed by the GoI a few years back, and told her about the same, but I'm not sure if private schools come under that Act. I Googled ([1](https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai/private-schools-staff-to-get-6-month-maternity-leave/story-WSTbikm6xYS0BqcWssSIuI.html) old article - 2010; [2](https://www.citehr.com/602223-maternity-leave-private-schools-entitled-follow-new.html); [3](https://www.india-briefing.com/news/maternity-leave-india-law-benefits-10294.html/)) about the same, but couldn't get a definite answer.

So guys, whats the law regarding maternity leaves in a private school? Or rather, private organizations? I know for sure that big organisations like TCS, Infosys, etc give maternity leave for 26 weeks, as per the maternity law.",cuawb7,,false,/r/india/comments/cuawb7/whats_the_law_regarding_maternity_leave_in/,AskIndia

Around 2015 a friend asked me to accompany her and some friends to New Dehli but I was really afraid to go.  I was always under the impression that India was dangerous, violent, and poor.

However, I want to find out more about India.  Whether or not my prejudices are true.  As a person from the West, I am thinking that maybe things might not be so bad.  In fact, I'm thinking that perhaps me visiting there can result in a posh experience because of the relative cost of living.

Still, I don't know.  I hear it is like China that is jam-packed with people resulting in people going to the bathroom in public places and a general rudeness and self-centeredness.  Is it like China in the sense that almost every person you will meet will try and take advantage of you somehow?

How is the medical there?  Is it easy to get prescription medication?

Is India is a good choice for being a Digital Nomad?

Can someone suggest a good place to live with the following?

1. Not very high temps in summer? (I am from Kolkata and the summer here are the worse (humidity) thing I have to endure)
2. Good unlimited internet? (I currently pay 500 bucks for a 10 Mbps connection)
3. Less pollution (metro cities for comparison) is a must. I had pneumonia so pollution causes pain in my lungs if inhaled for long times.
4. And most important, I would like to live alone. As an introvert (overused term), I do not like living with others (sorry if it sounds stupid) and thus living alone is a must for me. I can also cook for myself so food is not an issue.  (I am open to pay up to 6.5K (7K depending on the place) for rent)
5. I am also looking to extend my services locally (web development) but it is currently not a priority.

Few details that might be considered:

1. I am a freelance web developer. I can not share more details on my jobs and sources unfortunately due to legal reasons. So sorry for that.
2. I earn enough to pay for the rent and internet without any issues.
3. I am currently looking to leave my place and explore other place for 1-2 years, not permanent.

I have considered several cities already from several posts and articles, but so far nothing fits all my requirements, thus a post here in hopes of someone pointing me to right direction.

I live abroad, but I have family living in India. They are strong supporters of the BJP, and strongly support India's decision to revoke article 370. I constantly hear them talking about and praising what's happening, and then sharing Whatsapp forwards of ""articles"" that ""prove"" that India is in the right.  
I would like a real, unbiased understanding of what's going on. I mostly don't want to dogmatically support/be opposed to India's actions.  I don't really have any skin in the game, so I'm open to all viewpoints.  Most of the newspaper articles that I found online only give very brief overviews and not much detail.

1565893932,centre_punch,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cqtvqh/world_wars_and_india/,22,65,,,World Wars and India.,"India fought in the two world wars,neither of which they had anything to do with. Simply being under the rule of a colonial power, they were forced to fight and the result was 74187 deaths(WW I) and 87,000 deaths(WW II).

What were we rewarded with?
•Before the Great War,the then British leadership had a tacit agreement with the Indian leadership (particularly the ones from the Congress and the Liberals),that India would get dominion status in return of their support in the war.

What did they get in return?

•The Rowlatt Act of 1919,which gave the government sweeping powers to arrest anyone with the slightest hint of suspicion of treason against the King-Emperor.

•This was followed by brutal repressions in Punjab,during 1919 _Hartal_ (General Strike),where General Reginald Dyer,opened fire on unarmed citizens and killed 1000(Indian estimates).

***

Even after this barbaric act,India still stood upto the dangers of Axis powers,and the mainstream leadership decided to lend support to the war machine in WW II.

The Indians were awarded with _The Bengal Famine of 1943_ ,an entire _man-made_ food crisis at the hands of the Britishers (ostensibly led by Mr. Winston Churchill) causing _3 MILLION DEATHS_ 

***

So,for fighting a war which was never entirely theirs,never the people of India being complicit to European affairs and awarded by brutal repression each time,for simply wanting Independence..it is ridiculous.

3 years ago when i was in college, a friend of mine who was in Photography course had to travel to Jammu kashmir for photography. bad luck for him there was rioting going on and he couldnt contact back home since the army blocked all the communications. and had to find a landline to contact us and book a train ticket. 

The riot was because two kids got shot by the indian army as he told us. They where playing cricket and the ball got into military ground. and the kids got shot. Granted it was a restricted area but to shoot kids is not we do.

and even more shocking to me was this wasnt reported. I surfed through out the channels to see none of this was ever reported. But we see Everytime the kashmiri people do bad things in news, like the media wants us to see only that side.

1564897155,Iwaspepsodent_99,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/clsw1q/amidst_the_continuing_assault_on_privacy_within/,0,19,,,"Amidst the continuing assault on privacy within the country, here's one more scam from which you can't escape. (NPR data)","The next round of recording biometric and family­tree details of Indian citizens under the National Population Register (NPR) will be conducted in September 2020, a government notification said. The exercise is different from the decennial Census and is not linked to the National Register of Citizens (NRC).

The objective of the NPR is to create a comprehensive identity database of every usual resident in the country. The database would contain demographic as well as biometric particulars. 

The exercise was conducted earlier in two phases in 2010 and 2015, a senior government official said. For the purpose of the NPR, a usual resident is defined as a person who has resided in a local area for six months or more or a person  
who intends to reside in that area for the next six months or more.

Earlier, the roll out of NPR had slowed down due to overlapping with that of Aadhaar. “In pursuance of subrule(4) of rule 3 of the Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003, the Central government hereby decides to prepare and update the Population Register...... And the field work for house­to­house enumeration throughout the country except Assam for collection of information relating to all persons who are usually residing within the jurisdiction of local registrar shall be undertaken between the 1st day of April 2020 to 30th September 2020,” said a notification issued by Vivek Joshi, Registrar General of Citizen Registration and Census Commissioner.

**It is mandatory for every usual resident of India to register in the NPR.**

[https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/centre-to-ready-npr-for-pan-india-nrc/article28808817.ece](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/centre-to-ready-npr-for-pan-india-nrc/article28808817.ece)

Here's couple of arguments that one may present in favour of such an exercise:

1. It iS a DuTy aS CiTiZeNs of InDiA!!  
Counter: Then why is there an Aadhaar already in place.
2. It WiLL help wEeD oUt thE ILlegaL ImMiGraNts:  
Counter: Are you saying that NRC is a failure?
3. iT wAs Al$0 coNdUCted in 2010, duRinG UPA's RuLe!  
Counter: Bhai tab Aadhaar nahi tha.

Leaving the fun aside, why is this duplication of works being legitimised by the government? Why have an Aadhaar, NRC and NPR all together when any one of the three can perfectly suffice. Even if there are minute differences in the three, why doesn't some ""intelligent"" guy just roll all these up into one?

As far as I'm concerned, Aadhaar and NPR sound the same to me. Just imagine the magnitude of funds involved in any one and then multiply it by 3. That's what it will cost to implement all the three country-wide. This government is really hungry to know all about you- where you go, where do you live, what do you do, whom do you support, who are you in a relationship with...

Talking about redundancy, I'll give you one very specific example. I'm from Gandhinagar, Gujarat. I have witnessed the ""Gujarat Model"" in work. They have a fookin' ""Children's University"" there, which is supposedly ""teaching"" expecting mothers how to deal with pregnancy. I have never seen anyone exit or enter the premises, which sprawls over almost 3 to 4 football fields. THIS, when you have a nation-wide scheme of ASHA workers and Anganwadi doing the same bloody job and even more.

This ""Children's University"" is a classic example of diverting funds into literally defunct areas, making bloody artificial quotations for artificial demands and then hogging that hard-earned public money.

They say the roads of Gujarat are smooth AF don't they? Well no one told you that the same road are rebuilt literally every 6 months with poor materials so they there's a need to remake them again in another 6-8 months. Imagine the amount of money involved in each tender! And these roads are smooth only for the outer regions. The road right in front of my house wasn't rebuilt for almost 5 years and it deteriorated like hell.

TL;DR: Another redundant scheme by the data and money hungry GoRMinT to strip you off your privacy as well as hard earned money to achieve exactly zilch.",clsw1q,,false,/r/india/comments/clsw1q/amidst_the_continuing_assault_on_privacy_within/,Politics

**Rumour 1**- `Trifurucation of Jammu and Kashmir state into Jammu (new state) and Kashmir, Ladhak as Union territories `

&gt;*Under the proviso of Article 3 of the constitution, no bill for the purpose of forming a new state, increasing or decreasing the area of any state or attending the boundaries or name of any state could be introduced in parliament,unless the views of the state legislature concerned with respect to the provisions of the bill has been ascertained by the President. It was considered desirable that when a reference was made to the state legislatures for the said purpose, the President should be able to prescribe the period within which the states should convey their views, and should be open to the President to extend such period whenever he considered it necessary. It was also considered desirable to provide that bill would not be introduced until after the expiry of such period''.*

Currently, there is no elected state assembly in kashmir and no subsequent consultation, hence this option is impossible.",clw75v,,false,/r/india/comments/clw75v/why_trifurucation_of_jammu_and_kashmir_state_is/,Politics

I had made a post yesterday, petitioning for the President to return the RTI Amendment Bill to the Parliament for consideration. I understood that the idea was far-fetched, at a time when the institutions in our country have been reduced to a rubber stamp. But President Kovind was also the person who was a part of the Parliamentary Standing Committee drafted the original bill, including those provisions which have been removed or changed in the amendment. Sadly, the President failed us.

[http://egazette.nic.in/WriteReadData/2019/209696.pdf](http://egazette.nic.in/WriteReadData/2019/209696.pdf)

But our fight is far from over. We cannot give up. Imagine those people in Hong Kong who turned up in millions to fight for their rights. If we fail, we will not only fail ourselves, but also the future of India. We will be forever judged for our response to these attacks on the democracy.

Today, protesters are assembling at Jantar Mantar in Delhi at 4:30 pm. If you, or your friends are in Delhi, please join us in solidarity. PM me for details.",cl1a97,,false,/r/india/comments/cl1a97/important_update_regarding_rti_amendment_bill/,Politics

Time to brush up my writing skills and kill some time. So here we go...

The UK which consists of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, is preparing to withdraw from the European Union.

The European Union or EU is a political and economic union of 24 states in Europe. The EU aims for economic growth, stable market, technological advancement and overall development of the region. It has delivered half a century of peace, stability and prosperity and also launched a single European currency: the euro. People can also travel freely and work anywhere within the EU.

The UK is set to withdraw from the EU on 31st October 2019, however, it had been delayed several times in the past, during Theresa May's regime. 

Before leaving the EU, the UK has to decide on several important affairs like the rights of UK citizens in the EU, the rights of EU citizens in the UK, and several financial affairs. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, Prime Minister Boris Johnson yesterday suspended the British parliament, which means the parliament will no longer be able to debate on the matters of Brexit until October 14, when it will resume work.

Like any other global matter, it will affect trade worldwide and India is no exception. Many Indian owned companies have offices in the UK, which provides access to the EU. There are around 800 Indian owned companies in the UK (Jaguar Land Rover is owned by Tata group). Many of these firms have to adjust to the change as they made investments with the larger European market in mind. 

The Indian rupee may depreciate due to cash outflows, as foreign investors cash out local equities and also the dollar may strengthen which can contribute to the rupee depreciation. Gold may simmer as investors rush to the safe heaven. Experts believe prices of electronics can increase. However, the negative impacts on the IT sector will be short-termed.

&amp;#x200B;

There would also be positive effects of Brexit on us, due to falling pound, traveling to the UK will get cheaper. Also, British universities were earlier forced to favor the British students for scholarships, after Brexit, this might change and Indian students may get better chances of availing scholarships. Experts say Sensex and Nifty will tumble in the short run. However, the finance ministry maintains it has enough exchange reserves to handle the impact and the central bank will infuse necessary liquidity to keep the Indian economy ""well-behaved"".

I understand people can be wrong at times but if BJP is using his face is there any political philosophy that sardar had that resonates with BJPs goals.

I have however, lived in India for 6 years in Hyderabad. The whole time, I was and always will be proud of my Indian heritage and our amazing cultures all across the country. 

However, with the absolute BULLSHIT that the government is doing in Kashmir, I am terribly disappointed and I truly believe this is the worst thing India has ever done. But do you know what's even worse? Our fellow Indians are being BLINDLY nationalistic as always, ready to support the government from phantom threats. There should be protests happening in all the big cities, for what the Indian government is doing right now is an atrocity. People are getting shot on the street with anti-protesting shotguns. I guarantee that if this was happening in some other country, all of us would be quick to jump on the criticism bandwagon and compare them to North Korea. But I will tell you without any doubt that the actions India is taking against Kashmir is unwarranted and is comparable to the likes of North Korea of China, who you all so dearly detest. Say whatever you want, that I'm a snobby NRI who lives comfortable life in the U.S, or that I don't know any struggles in life. Who TF cares??? This isn't about me. This is about the greater good of our beautiful country. Why is everyone silent? This is absolutely unacceptable! 

NEVER HAVE I EVER BEEN SO ASHAMED TO BE INDIAN.

Pakistan have upped their PR game, this is the only way they can defeat India. They can't win against us in an 1v1 battle, they need someone with them and they have been trying their best to paint us as the bad guy.
And that's why they returned Abhinandan. They are in damage repair mode, their image is shit in world media.

We need to bring up atrocities they have been doing against their minorities like Hindus, Shias, Ahmadis.

Since the abrogation of article 370 one can clearly see how they have been protesting at every stage they get:

1. Imran has gone all out on Twitter with his Nazi and fascists remarks, because Nazi and racism are two words with huge history and they catch the attention of the western countries. A lot of newspapers have picked up his tweets, which is damaging our image.

2. That Priyanka Chopra incident.

3. A Pakistani actress gave a speech in Norway on how India has been using Bollywood to demonise muslims.

4. Their protests outside embassies and UN.

5. And many more incidents on different foreign platforms that I may have not noticed

What I find really ashtonishing is that it is Pakistan that is actually a genuine fascist state and here are some points that prove me right:

1. One can name a lot of Muslim celebrities in India, but one can't name a Hindu celebrity from Pakistan. Infact one can't name a non muslim celebrity from any of the Islamic countries. 

2. Islamic Republic of Pakistan's iron brother is a country where a muslim can't even name his kid after their prophet (Muhammad), can't grow a beard and many other restrictions. If I am not wrong a Chinese spokesperson even said that Islam is a mental disease. But they won't protest against them! Why?! Because they hate India more than they love Islam! Which is a genuine fascist trait.

4. You'll never find Hindus marrying Muslim women to convert them, whereas converting Hindu women by marrying them is a national hobby in Pakistan

https://qz.com/india/1395029/why-pakistans-hindu-women-covert-to-islam/

5. Hatred for Hindus in Pakistan's textbooks

https://www.dawn.com/news/672000

6. There is a reason why a whopping 5000 Hindus leave Pakistan to come to India every year and the reason is fascism

https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/forced-conversions-compel-5-000-hindu-families-to-leave-pakistan-per-year-117062100448_1.html

7. You can be hanged to death for blasphemy, once again a fascist trait 

https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/30/world/asia/pakistan-blasphemy-law.html

8. Under Pakistani law Ahmadis are not allowed to call themselves muslims and they are constantly persecuted, thus they run to Nepal. And once again this is what is called FASCISM

https://www.economictimes.com/news/international/world-news/ahmadis-in-pakistan-face-persecution-flee-to-nepal/articleshow/69865072.cms

1566110770,Top-_-_-_-_-Secret,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/crxz8i/is_china_handling_the_hong_kong_protests_better/,20,11,,,Is China handling the Hong Kong protests better than India would?,"Before the downvote storm and the 'it's incomparable' brigade, I ask you to consider how we've seen our own police and security forces treat unrest. 

Ours are free-handed with the use of [pellet guns](https://www.ndtv.com/topic/pellet-injuries), blinding countless dozens everytime there is a protest in Kashmir. In HK, *[one person](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/16/an-eye-for-an-eye-hong-kong-protests-get-figurehead-in-woman-injured-by-police)* was injured in the eye and it sparked protests. In India, [a 19-month-old baby](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/kashmirs-youngest-pellet-victim-19-month-old-hibba-stokes-protests/article25599553.ece) can get blinded and it won't wake our national conscience.

In Hong Kong, there have been only about 4 deaths so far, despite the protesters numbering in lakhs and going on for months. This has only strengthened the movement — despite the fact that they know they could **all*  get wiped out and soon.

In India, [11 people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoothukudi_massacre) were shot to death last year by police in a state that is *not* a disturbed area last year and there were no consequences.

11 people. No consequences. No justification. Governments would **fall** for such a thing in many countries.

Heck, even the bill that is being protested — that would make HKers be extradited to the mainland for certain crimes. How much worse is this than UAPA (where the govt can declare an individual as a terrorist through a simple notification in the Gazette of India) — if you are sceptical as to how this can be abused, I'd urge you to read [Kafkaland: Prejudice, law and counterterrorism in India](https://threeessays.com/books/kafkaland/). Arbitrary detention in the Indian prison system is something that can happen to anyone anywhere. 

The simple reality is that our courts have so much backlog that you can spend years in jail on a made-up pretence without trial. 

The more you read about the situation of freedom in China, the more you start to wonder how eerily close (or worse) India is in almost every regard. State-sponsored human rights abuse? Check. Social credit monitoring systems? [Check](https://scroll.in/article/879833/government-plans-to-monitor-individual-social-media-users-to-gauge-opinion-about-official-policies) (we do it more informally with our growing lists of anti-national categorizations).

Police brutality during protests? Oooh check. (Anyone with firsthand experience of any protest can testify to what happens. This is something you should live through to understand. Even boring-ass protests will see you get a lathi up the ass, forget protests on matters of consequence).

Consider again that months into protests in Hong Kong, China *still has not cut the internet access* of the city. The protests continue to be guided by Telegram and social media. Part of this is a [wise move](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/13/world/asia/hong-kong-telegram-protests.html) that allows the state to monitor people better than if you switch it off. But, imagine the same thing in India — once Section 144 comes into place, and the internet is cut off arbitrarily for everyone whether or not you protest. [India leads the world](https://www.forbes.com/sites/meghabahree/2018/11/12/india-leads-the-world-in-the-number-of-internet-shutdowns-report/) in the number of internet shutdowns.

Of course, the protests are not over and we may well see a repeat of Tiananmen. In India, at least, that would be impossible. After all, our system kills people when they are [in police custody](https://www.newsclick.in/high-numbers-custodial-deaths-police-butchering-basic-human-rights), not when they are in the streets.

I didn't mean this to become a comparison of freedoms in India and in China but it's a terrible topic to look into. The more you think about it, the less different we seem. It reminds me of how, years ago, India was a very different place from Saudi Arabia — it was impossible to make any comparison. But now, it's not that hard.

You know shit is pretty fucked when you are no longer confident that your own supreme leader would do a more humane job of handling a protest that Xi fucking Jinping.",crxz8i,,false,/r/india/comments/crxz8i/is_china_handling_the_hong_kong_protests_better/,Politics

Going back in time USA purchased Alaska from Russia, Puerto Rico from France and few more territory from British and Mexico.

Hypothetically, what if China + Pakistan nexus offered us some hefty sum to mark the present LOC and LAC as International Borders. Maybe Pakistan would want Kashmir too. Our forex reserves are at $400B. Would India offer to accept this at maybe $100B?

Contrary, would Pakistan + China accept to secede their claims to J&amp;K and Arunachal Pradesh if we offered them $100B

The evidences about the protests have actually been proven to be true by some Indian news media.  Why aren't our news media showing the true side of it, rather than hiding all the facts behind a facade of normality? Isn't it obvious that the kashmiri's themselves are against it? Wasn't the alert for a terrorist attack a false alarm? What's actually the plan? Are we trying deviant tricks to pursue our dominance? How long would falsehood prevail anyway. 


I might be wrong , so feel free to correct and answer in a civilize manner because *I DO STAND CORRECTED* And please no Pakistani/antinational B.S .


If we as a nation are truly on the right path, then it should be clear to us about any legal measures taken by our govt is right and that our stances can stand firm to counter any opposing views.

Doctors need to go through a minimum of 5-7 years of training to even begin practicing.

Engineers 4 and maybe more to start working.

And most other streams, the same, at least with a minimum of 3 years (engineering and medicine were cited only because they are the most common and also the most relate able).

Why, of all the things in this country, do the people who rule the entire damn nation not have to go through a single test? Even if having tests in a common language is a barrier, they can write tests in their own language. Why do we not have psychological testing for each and every person in the government ? I know education does not equate to being a good leader, but a good leader should have a reasonable standard of education. Also, why the hell do we have people in the parliament with prior cases of criminal convictions? Several jobs don't even employ people even if you have a single case/offence in your name.

And here we have our fucking prime minister running around with Bear Grylls rather than going on national TV and announcing that the country is being ravaged by goons spirited in the name of religion. When will we, as individuals, learn to empathize with each other and understand that whoever you pray to, you're all in this goddamn thing together till the end.",cphu3c,,false,/r/india/comments/cphu3c/is_this_valid_reasoning_genuinely_curious/,Politics

If the minority leaders today are given a choice to pick between India or a nation based on their minority, it’s not very difficult to imagine the side they’ll be leaning towards.

There have been injustices in the past against the majority that are attributed to the minorities. But there is no place for revenge in the idea of India as the people who built in 1947 imagined it. I love the vision of India Nehru chose because it was built on the foundations of love. It was a picture of hope and brotherhood and inclusiveness with little room for fundamentalism and religious animosity. 

The current situation only goes on to show how important it becomes to choose our representatives. How important it is to inculcate and educate the masses about how what unites us, will always be stronger than what divides us. 

But it is easier to hate than to love. There is a pride associated with belonging to a group-and the moment we belong to one group we automatically stop belonging to another and we’ve lost the game right there.

I’m tired of defending and believing in the idea of Nehru’s India. The thing about being part of a really large country that absolutely sucks is how majoritarianism will prevail even if another viewpoint is more prudent. Democracy, ladies and gentleman, is turning out to be an absolute shitshow. 

A very happy early Independence Day to us I guess.",cpi5ob,,false,/r/india/comments/cpi5ob/the_idea_of_india/,Politics

In words of Benito Mussolini –

“Democracy is a kingless regime infested by many kings who are sometimes more exclusive, tyrannical and destructive than one, if he be a tyrant. It is the fear of being exposed by the media before the public that most of the politicians keep themselves under control to some extent""

If media is honest and committed in its job, democracy is bound to function more efficiently and the loopholes present in any democratic system can certainly be plugged to the fullest satisfaction of the people. On the contrary, if media is biased, corrupt and favours only a particular party or few individuals, it can prove to be very dangerous for the smooth functioning of democracy.

For this very reason I believe people like Arnab Goswami

- This case is for events that happened in 2008.
- The FIR for this was filed in 2017.
- He has been raided FOUR times (adds that no one in the history of India has been raided so many times). 
- He has been questioned TWENTY times by the various agencies.
- Each time he has spent around 10 hours with them.
- He has also been taken in custody briefly for 11 days by CBI.
- Despite all this, even till August 2019, no chargesheet has yet been filed.

*Source*: [""Drama For Viewing Pleasure Of Some"": Karti Chidambaram On Father's Arrest](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/karti-chidambaram-on-fathers-arrest-drama-for-viewing-pleasure-of-some-2088537?ndtv_related)

---------------

Shri. Chidambaram held a press conference in Congress Headquarters to address the public on the INX Media case and the charges against him. 

**The highlights**:

- He claimed that the FIR by the CBI does not impute any guilt on him.
- He has not even been accused formally of any wrongdoing.
- No chargesheet has been filed against him in any court.
- While the propaganda was being spread that he was absconding, he was actually with his lawyers the whole night, preparing his appeal for the SC, and he was actually in the Supreme Court when the appeals were filed!

- He reaffirmed his faith in the judiciary and the judges.

--------

**Following is the FULL transcript, from the video, of what he said to the press**:  
(*Source*: [AICC Press briefing by P Chidambaram at Congress HQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k53p4wSFGTY).)

&gt; *I believe the foundation of democracy is liberty. The most precious article of the constitution of India is article 21 that guarantees life and liberty. If I am asked to choose between life and liberty, I shall unhesitatingly choose liberty.*

&gt; *Why are the years up till 1947 called the years of freedom struggle. Because to win freedom we must struggle. To preserve freedom too, we must struggle.*

&gt; *In the last 24 hours, much has happened that has caused concern for some and confusion to many. My statement today is to dispel that concern and confusion.*

&gt; ***In the INX media case. I have not been accused of any offence***. *Nor has anyone else including any member of my family been accused of any offence. In fact,* ***there is no chargesheet filed by either the CBI or the ED before a competent court***. *Moreover,* ***the FIR recorded by the CBI does not impute to me any wrongdoing. Yet, there is a widespread impression that grave offences have been committed***, *and my son and I have committed those offences.*

&gt; *Nothing can be further from the truth.*

&gt; ***These are lies spread by pathological liars.***

&gt; *When I was summoned by the CBI, and then the ED, to appear for questioning, I naturally sought interim protection against arrest from the competent court. I was granted interim protection by the orders of the high court dated 31 may 2018 and 25 july 2018. I have enjoyed the interim protection from the last 13-15 months. The matters were finally heard on 23 jan 2019 and judgements reserved. Now, after 7 months, yesterday the high court was pleased to dismiss the pre-arrest bail applications.*

&gt; *My lawyer, who are also my dear friends, and who are present here, advised me to move the SC. On my behalf they did so yesterday evening, and today. They appealed repeatedly to the honourable SC to list the appeals for hearing urgently and in the meanwhile grant me interim protection.* ***While my lawyers, all senior counsels, were moving the SC, other lawyers and I worked through the night last night to prepare the papers. We completed the task only this morning and immediately filed the appeals in the SC. I was working alongside my lawyers the whole of last night. Today, throughout the day I was with my lawyers following the proceeding in the SC.***

&gt; ***I was aghast that I was accused of hiding from the law. On the contrary I was seeking protection from the law. I was accused of running away from justice. On the contrary I was engaged in the pursuit of justice.***

&gt; *My lawyers have told me that despite their impassioned pleas, their cases were not listed for today nor will they be listed tomorrow. but will be only listed on Friday. I bow down to the order of the honourable SC.*

&gt; *Between now and Friday, I shall walk with a clear conscience and my head held high.* ***I shall respect the law, even if it is applied with an unequal hand by the investigating agencies.*** *In the name of freedom I can only hope and pray the investigating agencies will also respect the law. In the present circumstances, respect for the law can only mean one thing - await the decision of the honourable SC on Friday.*

&gt; *Some days ago, when I spoke in Parliament, I had said that every judge in this country will uphold the liberty of the citizen. I had said the collective conscience and the institutional memory of the court as a venerable institution will guide all judges of the country.* 

&gt; *As much as I believe in liberty, I also believe in the wisdom of our judges. So friends, until Friday and beyond, the lamp of liberty will shine bright and illuminate the whole country.*

I'm mostly looking for any articles or books that give a good background of India-Pakistan relations, from pre-independence up to current affairs. Ideally would want those with minimum bias towards both sides, however balanced recommendations (some favoring one side, some the other) work too!  
Been super curious about this, largely due to the current climate, and also after reading chapter 7 from [Prisoners of Geography](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25135194-prisoners-of-geography) by Tim Marshall (which gives a really good overview, highly recommend).

Of course, Pakistani association with them is much stronger because of Islam, and Pakistan wants to consolidate Kashmir inside their territory because it's just as strategic. 

Now, India's name is added to the list of tarnished once again with this issue. 2012, it was that Delhi rape, 2014, it was Modi getting elected, and every year since Modi was there, there was lynching, murder and violence over transportation of Cows, or accusing minorities and lower caste for consuming beef. In international stage, India as a country is looked as an economic front runner, but in terms of social progress, we are seen as regressive, except the new LGBT laws, but other major issues just foil this progressive image of ours. 

And I think even the idea of India is being tarnished, because of many things, now every state is directly being held at ransom, especially the ones who didn't vote for BJP, I don't know if it's the norm of Modi's government or if it's the Indian government. Let me begin with Hindi language imposition in non-Hindi speaking states, why should these non-Hindi speaking states even try to learn Hindi when their citizens got the opportunities in their own states, in fact, Hindi speakers are the ones who are coming to these non-Hindi speaking states in the South to get jobs. This is just majority trying to dominate the minority. 

Kashmir is already discussed. But what about the North East, many of them really feel alien and they too have status similar to Jammu &amp; Kashmir as it was before. They might want to become independent from India, would India allow it to happen? I don't see any reason for them to be attached with India except for economic reasons. They are racially different, so they face discrimination in the mainland India. They are also culturally different, they are kind of Tribal(not that it is a bad thing, in fact, India's tribal culture is totally destroyed, their sustainable living is gone).

1565724763,iheartsubmariner,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cpy3w6/np_in_response_to_the_thread_asking_if_people_are/,6,16,,,"[NP] In response to the thread asking if people are seeing signs of the economic slowdown, let me explain why it's not going to affect Narendra Modi or his government's electoral successes.","Okay, let me get one thing out of the way - I am a business owner, so I have direct experience with market spurts and slowdowns. So my perspective is influenced by what I observe and understand from my position.

In the thread I am responding to, I mentioned that I saw some decline in trading volumes, but overall profitability is not affected because I am managing inventory better. However this implies a few things:

1. I am hoarding less stock for days when my sales volume may mean a shortage of stock
2. I am being more selective in what I purchase
3. There is an overall slowdown in the transportation of goods, partially as a result of the increased compliance that GST entails, and partially because transporters are overloaded with shipments and have a shortage of trucks during periods of heavy demand
4. I have raised prices on items to improve profitability

Now, while my own position is relatively stable, as the credit burden on me is lower, it does mean that my suppliers are getting fewer orders from me, which directly hurts their top and bottom lines. Almost all my suppliers are manufacturers or brand-owners, so they depend on large volumes for profitability.

On the plus side I am making payments faster than ever so that helps my suppliers' cash flow. While I was averaging payments in 45-60 days earlier, I've been able to cut it down by over 33%, with payments being released in 25-30 days.

Goods are reaching us slower, so we can't show them to our customers on time. This is good for me in that I can get rid of more stored inventory. This is bad for me because my customers get miffed that I don't have ""new variety"". This is bad for manufacturers since if their products reach late, it means they don't sell fast enough, and potentially it increases the amount of goods I return to them citing weak sales.

To make up for the shortfall in volumes and to balance out predatory pricing that the market is notorious for, I had to raise prices on other items to make up for lost margins on low-margin items. I kid you not, people sell brand new goods at cost in my general area of business. If one of them goes bust, another one takes their place.

**But wait! How does one small business affect the entire economy?! How is it relevant to the title?**

Okay, so here's the thing - the entire market that I am in is seeing sluggish sales. We're actually one of the best in the area. Our customers are seeing weak sales from their own customers. So ultimately the entire market's turnover has gone down, which directly squeezes manufacturers by the balls.

**But this doesn't explain the title!**

Yes, it doesn't. However, it is a part of the story. Now let me present to you some ideas about how I perceive the Indian economy to work.

1. There are two kinds of ""normal"" consumers in India. One is the middle class, and the other is the poor.
2. There is the often talked about informal/shadow economy. Even if the government would like you to believe otherwise, it is very much alive and kicking. Pretty much everyone managed to remonetise the banned currency notes.

When we look at auto, FMCG, tech, advertising etc and only see streaks of red, we forget that most of the economic news is targeted at the broad spectrum of middle class.

Some key points to keep in mind for context:

1. Poor people can't afford cars, so mass market car manufacturers only target the middle class, and mass market bike manufacturers the lower middle class and urban poor. This group of people is typically made of salaried employees earning more than five lakhs a year before taxes, or they are micro enterprises (think that 5sqft cigarette shop which is nothing more than a cabinet randomly placed in a building) dodging income tax for the most part.
2. Most of the major FMCG brands often have to keep prices low to target a large audience. That's why you see the famed 10% extra every other month, as prices remain constant but quantity and/or quality goes down SKU after SKU. They also keep advertising heavily to remain relevant.
3. Advertisers depend on brands to keep them afloat. This is obvious and needs no further detail.

**So how exactly is the economic slowdown not visible?**

With the context that I mentioned above, let's first look at FMCGs. As I stated earlier, FMCGs target a broad market. It doesn't matter if you're rich or poor, prince or pauper, you're probably buying that bar of chocolate you've eyed at the grocery store. You're definitely buying detergent for your clothes, this week's food supply etc. If you're middle class, it becomes a no-brainer purchase, and economic slowdown or not, if you need a box of detergent a month, you need a box of detergent a month and no economic slowdown is going to stop you from buying one. That chocolate can wait.

*However*, for the poor person that chocolate turns into discretionary expenditure. Remember how as a relatively well-off person you might be throwing your clothes in the laundry every day, for it to by cycled as a bunch at the end of the week? The poor person might wear the same clothes for two (or three) days without washing, and instead of detergent they'll buy the cheaper detergent bar which will be used more sparingly. They'll buy a chocolate or three less frivolously, and scold their kids for asking for one to keep budgets under control. Their usage patterns are not changing.

So if FMCGs are taking a hit, it's because middle class people are spending less frivolously, which is affecting sales volume.

This directly affects the salaried middle class, because they are employed by businesses, and businesses depend on profitability to grow and hire more people. If their profits are down, then it means they will be more stingy with bonuses, discretionary allowances, raises etc. Which means the middle class has less money to spend. Which means they'll postpone that dream car. Which means less sales by car manufacturers.

If brands can't make money, they have none to spend on advertising. Ergo, advertising takes a hit.

These interconnected business webs go on and on and even a year wouldn't be enough to talk about it.

**Aakhir kehna kya chahte ho bhai?** [So what exactly is it that you're trying to tell us, man?]

Do you remember that shadow economy mentioned earlier? Well, you see, there's an entire class of people who deal 99.9% in cash. Even with all these pushes for ""Digital India"" and ""Go Cashless"" and ""BHIM"" and ""Aadharpay"" etc etc, these people keep very little money in the bank, whether it's because they're uneducated/illiterate, poor or evading taxes is besides the point. They also happen to be the biggest class of consumer in this country.

If a car dealer goes bust, it doesn't affect them. If the share market crashes, it doesn't affect them. Their *sabjiwala* is still coming every tuesday, and the cellphone they bought in 2015 is still functional. Their employers, who are anywhere between middle class and ultra rich, haven't fired them so they're receiving their weekly or monthly wages, that too in cold hard cash.

While we keep hearing about lakhs of jobs being lost, we forget that these most of these lakhs of jobs are mostly middle class. Middle class people employ the poor as drivers, *daiyyas* (maids), *darwans* (watchmen) etc, because it's too much effort to do these things themselves, and in any case the family will disapprove when they can still afford to pay these people.

So in the near term, for the *garib insan* (poor person) that Modi has made a point to keep resonating with, all this talk about economy and business is irrelevant, because they don't feel it affecting them.

I expect the BJP will do better than they ever did in the elections of 2020.",cpy3w6,,false,/r/india/comments/cpy3w6/np_in_response_to_the_thread_asking_if_people_are/,Politics

1566877893,gg1998,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cvz12o/my_little_study_in_tripura_assembly_elections_of/,6,21,,,My little study in Tripura assembly elections of 2018,"Though we always seem to hear that BJP's magic in winning toughest of the elections but Tripura was pretty much a very interesting case study for various reasons.   

1. For the first time BJP was eyeing to dislodge a left-wing political system, a front on which BJP had never fought previously.  
2. Just like BJP and unlike INC, the left is pretty much a cadre based party with a definite ideology. So unlike INC, BJP had to fight an organisation coupled with a strong ideology.  
3. Generally BJP's historical relevance in North-East was more or less confined to Assam and Arunachal Pradesh.  

For these reasons the results were more astonishing. So I back then thought that I should try to dig deep, but because I'm lazy I put it off. Now after finding time I thought, well better late than never.(Also I would pretty much like if I can compare the Loksabha results, AC-wise to see how the situation had changed. )   

So, I felt like doing a segmentation analysis of the Assembly constituencies based on their voting patterns. So here I decided against the traditional approach of segmenting assembly constituencies based off the victory margin-size as they don't always tell a coherent story. So I did a cluster analysis with the whole data on every assembly constituency as the row variable(aka the sample) and voting percentages of all the parties contesting in that assembly constituency as the column variable(aka the attributes of the sample).  

If anyone is interested, [Cluster Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis).  

So without further ado I'll come straight to the point. So by my method I was able to make groups of assembly constituencies with a very similar voting pattern and I found some cool insights, which I'll share with you.   

&amp;#x200B;

[This is the 5 segments that I've found in the data. The number 5 was arrived through the variance minimization method by using an elbow graph. The picture depicts the vote share of the three main combines in all the segments.](https://i.redd.it/xgxvqjddtwi31.png)

&amp;#x200B;

[This image shows the number of seats belonging to each of the segments.](https://i.redd.it/0364x7iwtwi31.png)

&amp;#x200B;

|*Segment descriptions*|*Size of the segment*|
|:-|:-|
|Lean\_LF|15|
|Strongest\_NDA|3|
|Stronger\_NDA|9|
|Strong\_NDA|32|
|Lean\_NDA|1|

 So after doing these exercises I thought of a closer inspection of every segment and to see their intra-segment mechanics.  

So I got the data about the district-wise assembly segments and the reservation status of the respective seats.(like whether a seat is reserved for the SC category or ST category or it has no reservation i.e. General Seat/Un-reserved seat)  

&amp;#x200B;

[In this chart the cross section of each segment with respect to category  has been shown. ](https://i.redd.it/ua7io2l5wwi31.jpg)

From this figure there are some very interesting pattern can be noted, the are mainly but not limited to the following.  

1. LF still had a good hold on the UR/General seats. 
2. NDA's main impetus came from ST and SC reserved seats.
3. Between SC and ST, LF took a bigger drubbing from the latter.  

&amp;#x200B;

[This chart shows the cross section of districts by the segments](https://i.redd.it/av2hdpccxwi31.jpg)

From this chart the key takeaways are

1. West Tripura has become a happy hunting ground for NDA. 
2. LF  still held the ground in North Tripura, Sipahijila and Unakoti.
3. South Tripura favoured NDA.
4. Dhalai became NDA's strongest suit.

Now this is all I've to say but I'll do a comparative analysis once I get the Loksabha data.

Recently, I was appalled at the current govt toying with the idea of an anti-conversion law as I feel that it impinges on the fundamental rights of people. While coercive conversations are obviously despicable, these laws (see the article) are generally vague. Also, some of them have an interesting caveat wherein converting back to one's ancestral religion aka *ghar wapsi* won’t be considered a religious conversion.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1947_Jammu_massacres

The said massacres did change the demography of jammu to a hindu dominated province.

 The resultant exodus did result in Kashmir becoming a mega muslim dominated valley than it was before. 

The above massacres  did provide pakistan an excuse to conduct its attack via pathans, so as to take over kashmir, and throw away the ""standstill agreement""

The above massacres provided an excuse for pakistan to get themselves represented by Zafarullah khan who presented a case against india that the invasion was a natural excuse against the ""genocide"" and that it forced 6 million to pakistan.

The above massacres also provided a nudge towards the attacks on kashmiri pundits.

1565154356,rocketboy666,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cn1hn3/progress_with_purpose_not_for_the_sake_of_it/,3,2,,,"Progress with purpose, not for the sake of it.","This post isn't meant to endorse a political view, but rather point out how political views now are eating into every facet of our lives as Indians. This post is meant for everyone who reads it to just understand what is happening in our India and what we have normalised.

Over the course of 5 days our government has gone forward and made history, yet we are uncertain whether this was a step forward or a blot on our history books. Over the years, as Indians, we have gotten used to the honest corruption we see. Bribes, whether it be to government office employees, cops, or even the process of buying election tickets within our political parties; we live with it. When it comes to cases of journalists being offed, rapists being let off, or murderers getting bail instantly, we have more or less come to the conclusion that that is how the modern India works. We have gotten so normalised to it that our MPs, MLAs, and some of our most senior ministers have some extremely shameful allegations against them, yet we give in simply because we realise Indian politics now works that way. The politicians need to get their hands dirty if they want to make a change or if they want to get elected, that is the price they pay, and voting them in despite their records is the price we pay. 

Taking all of the above into consideration, we arrive at the issue of Kashmir and the last 5 days. I am not here to pick BJP or Congress or JDU or CPI(M) or AIADMK or any political party, because what has now happened is above all the politics that can be played. The method through which our current government passed through this legislature clearly violates our constitution. The fact that elections weren't held in Kashmir after the Lok Sabha Election this year (as recommended) just highlights the extent to which our government is willing to go to satisfy its agenda and its vote base, but at some point we have to open our eyes and see that the corruption and circumvention of our constitution is far more than any political agenda. To those in the past few days who have justified the status of Kashmir being demoted to a UT, to those who have turned a blind eye to 35,000 troops stationed there, the fact that all comms lines are shut (including the internet), and that the ""opposition"" leaders have been put under house arrest and the right to congregate has been taken away, please put your politics and economics aside, this is the constitution we are talking about. To anyone who has said that that ""doesn't matter"" we're on our way to history, the constitution matters, because if it doesn't matter then nothing matters. None of the freedom, security, or rights that we're provided have any value in the future if we justify such an issue with its possible economic gain. 

We are making history, yet we do not know whether the future of the region in question is going to be a stabler one or one with more rife and unrest. YET, we have civilians repeating the mantra of their political leaders claiming that this is a victory. India as a country has gotten lazy in the sense we are ok with our daily corruptions, it makes the country move, it makes shit happen. But there is a red line which stops our government from behaving as a god, and that red line is defined by our constitution. If we do not even acknowledge and take into account the gross method with which our constitution and our parliamentary procedure has been treated, then there is no hope for the future. The past few days in parliament really prove that our leaders want to make changes irrespective of their consequences on the population. 

Damn right we're making history, but with no indication as to how the future is going to turn out, this is just proving that we're making changes for the sake of making changes. Our current government has time and again flaunted its superb ideas for change, whether it be demonetisation, one nation one election, building of bullet trains, or the Kashmir issue, all of those have been progress for the sake of progress. Each of the 4 issues I mentioned above are highly contentious; demonetisation decimated the lower income levels when it was first introduced and almost halted cash flows amongst that section, one nation one election is straight up a violation of our constitution and is just a manoeuvre to rack up votes, the bullet trains are being made with tax payers money which should be going to education or towards bettering our existing transport facilities and is happening at the cost of our mangroves and our vegetation and the tribal and rural people who own that land, and Kashmir was done at the cost of Article 3 and all the Kashmiri people themselves. 

Progress for the sake of progress leads us to uncertainty, progress with a purpose leads us to solid outcomes which will pull us out of the state we are in. We will forever be the poster boys of the 3rd world, that image of ours has not changed for a long time and it won't, whether we're involved in the BRICS, whether we send a ship to the moon, or whether we attend the international summits. Our government has consistently created a culture where change will be brought at the cost of anything, and the ones who bear that cost at the end of the day are the people directly affected by it. You were affected by demonetisation, not them. The villages between Mumbai and Ahmedabad are facing the issue with their land taken away against their will, not the government. The people of Kashmir are currently on lockdown, not our central government. It has come to this because, as I said, we have shown to our leaders that you can be a murderer and get away with it, you can be a rapist and get away with it, and you bribe and buy your way to power and you can get away with it because that is how India works, ""we get it "" right? 

As voters, we have gone to far lengths to justify the actions of our representatives and their legislature, but there must come a time when we evaluate the state of affairs and understand what is wrong. We cannot normalise infringing upon the constitution, we absolutely cannot. No matter what economic, political, social gain the government hopes to get out of its latest move, it does not outweigh the fact that they circumvented and violated the constitution while doing so. And fuck it, they don't give a damn, but we should. Stop looking at everything through the political lens of our leading parties and start looking at how it affects our entire country, our country is not just BJP it is not just Congress and it is not just any state-specific party, our country rests in our people. 

Progress with Purpose. That is what we need, that is what we should want, and that is what we should strive for.",cn1hn3,,false,/r/india/comments/cn1hn3/progress_with_purpose_not_for_the_sake_of_it/,Politics

In our neighbourhood, we used to have this uncle from bjp, grandfather's age kind a senior but at local level, his wife passed away one day. I was playing and  suddenly there was a white ambassador with red beacon got parked in front of our home. Security guards and there she came out very well dressed as usual in her saree. The moment i saw her i ran inside my home announcing at top of my voice to everyone that i saw her, i couldn't able to recall her name but know her by face. Everyone got excited and decided to wait to see her leaving. There she came out, waved at us with the same smiling gesture as she always have and left.

As a kid this whole thing had left an impression on me and from that day i never forgot her name. Used to gloat in school that i saw her in front of my home and how our area is politically active with such politicians thanks to that uncle.

Right now just watched NDTV documentary, a day with her from NDTV's vasu. Will post the link if found.

https://youtu.be/TYGGBt39tyE

The whole point after seen a bite from yogi adityayanath about her is she used to keep in touch for very minute things too and this documentary made me realise she valued the emotions of people a lot that's why now i can relate why she turned up for mourn. She was a real people's person. Don't want to compare but Indira Gandhi of BJP the way she herself compared in documentary.

RIP

I could've posted this in the Megathread, but I felt *it may go unnoticed. That said, we've (or, I've) been seeing several people and news articles saying this is unconstitutional, that it violates the Federal structure of India, that it gives the authority to the government to act the same way with any other state in the future, and most importantly, that it's affecting the lives of some people living there.

My question is: what could have the Government of India done better in handling this? Assuming the scrapping of the Article is inevitable (by this government), should they have given a prior notice? If it's good and if people like, appreciate and welcome it, why not come out in the open before the act? Some like this and some don't. Wouldn't this cause public outcry and probably protests and clashes? However, on the other hand, aren't disagreements and disputes expected and part and parcel of democracy? Why shut down the place altogether? Who's to say this won't happen to other states? Some say it's entirely legal while others say it's not and that it would be challenged in the Supreme Court. I'm curious and interested to know others perspectives on this. Thanks.",cnakb7,,false,/r/india/comments/cnakb7/what_would_have_been_a_right_way_to_scrap_article/,Politics

We have all been moaning about this problem since decades but nobody has done anything about it. Congress is criticizing this move now but why didn't they do anything in the ten long years they had?

From Pakistan's perspective, I don't see why are they making so much noise about Kashmir? Why can't they apply the Punjab model here too - just as Punjab is divided into Pakistani and Indian Punjab, why can't the same be applied to Kashmir too? Its a peaceful and least resistance path in the present circumstances.

Asking the citizens (plebiscite) is a wrong idea according to me because this will send a very wrong message to the integrity of our nation. Any state tomorrow will come with the idea of becoming a separate country in the name of plebiscite. Even strategically, J&amp;K becoming a country is out of question as it will be surrounded by super powers on all the sides.

If it continues to play out the way it is now, the end result is the defeat of the Free Planets Alliance.","Okay, so most of you have probably never heard of Legend of the Galactic Heroes (LotGH), so all I can recommend is that if you have even a slight interest in intellectually invigorating and somewhat wordy and slow-paced TV shows, give this one a try and watch at least the main series, which is 110 episodes long. Forgive me if some of this goes over your head, since I'll try to keep it simple without revealing too much about the show.

For the rest of you hindustani weebs (we have a [subreddit](/r/HindustaniWeeb)\* for it kek), I shouldn't have to say much more, but for the sake of the ones who are out of the loop, here goes.

Basically, the gist is, in LotGH, most of the Milky Way has been colonised and Earth (Terra) is nothing more than a frontier planet of minor significance. For various reasons (watch the show to find out) the galaxy has been divided into three parts - two superpowers, the Free Planets Alliance (FPA) and the Galactic Empire (Empire), and one small neutral territory with a lot of economic clout called Phezzan (or Fezzan).

As you can guess from what was said earlier, the FPA is at war with the Empire and has been for a _really_ long time. From the name you can tell that the Empire is exactly what the name implies, a monarchy, while the FPA is its foil - a democracy with elections to contest. Sub-national politics is not given any importance, so I cannot say how unitary or federal their government is.

The FPA has an RSS/VHP/nationalist-equivalent called the Patriotic Knights Corps (PKC). In reality they're just the henchmen of Job Trunicht, a politician who is introduced first as the Secretary of Defence and then the National Council Chairman. People who speak out against him are attacked in an attempt to silence them and enable the government's propaganda.

As you can probably guess, the FPA's politicians are extremely corrupt. They are more concerned with winning elections than governing their country. This leads them to consider a highly risky military campaign against the Empire. As SecDef, Trunicht is so corrupt that he actually argues in favour of launching that aforementioned campaign, while when it comes to a vote, he chooses the opposite stance. So he is able to create the public perception that he is not in favour of needless spending. The rest of the members of the council laugh off the pacifists who care more about governance than winning elections.

Obviously, the campaign is approved, and predictably it is such a major disaster that the FPA economy is shattered and their military is reduced to a shadow of itself. Unsurprisingly, the government falls and Trunicht gets that coveted chairmanship, since he had earlier popularised himself as a pragmatist.

When the Empire launches a punitive campaign in retaliation, he leads his country to a defea at the hands of the Empire, ordering his army to stand down when they're about to kill the Emperor because Heinessen, the capital, is under siege.

After that, he actually goes to the same Emperor who defeated him, looking for a job!

**How does this relate to the India?**

The parallel I am trying to draw is that Narendra Modi is playing a dangerous game, behaving very similarly to Job Trunicht. His government has taken all sorts of ridiculous steps in the previous term and this one which have weakened the economy, increased jingoism, drowned out dissent and opposition, increased polarisation of the electorate, and subverted democratic process and procedure. His bhakts, his IT cell, and the presstitutes under his thumb collectively make up the PKC, deciding what an ignorant people should be thinking. Unlike the FPA, which still had freedom of the press to a large extent, that is sadly not the case in India at the moment.

Pretty much every action that his government has taken has been timed to reap dividends during elections. At the end of this year, Haryana, Jharkhand, Sikkim and Maharashtra go to polls this year, and Jammu &amp; Kashmir may have their elections in 2020, along with Bihar. A whole bunch of important states will have elections in 2021 as well, and these elections will inevitably have an effect on the populace there, along with any other so-called masterstrokes that Modi's government will take.

I do not claim to know under whose orders Modi is acting (Trunicht was under the orders of someone else), or whether he is acting independently. However I do know that if this goes on for the remainder of his long four and a half years in power, at a time of increasing geopolitical and economic instability, it won't be very long before the damage to the fabric of this country is made semi-permanent and we lose a decade of progress to people like him. As I mentioned in another thread, none of his actions truly damage the poor in the short term, and they lack the education to realise the long term damage that they get.

I also do not claim to know an alternative, however I do know that an unrestrained power is dangerous. The recent political tumults in Kashmir have shown that the government is not shy to restrain people they consider dangerous to their political ideology.

What's worse is that the governor of Jammu &amp; Kashmir withdrew his invitation to RaGa just because he asked that he be allowed to tour the area freely, instead of the guided tour *a la* [North Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism_in_North_Korea) that was offered to him. Somehow Zee News found it fit to portray his demands misleadingly and push the blame on him.

PM Modi‘s diplomacy is a disaster.  Thanks to his megalomania &amp; love of self, he believes that belligerence &amp; hyper-toxic (but useless) masculinity is the solution to everything.

Now here’s an example of efficient diplomacy under Dr. Singh: 

Around 2009, China suddenly started issuing stapled visas to residents of J&amp;K &amp; a few other NE states of India. The intention behind China’s actions was, typically, to provoke &amp; intimidate.

This issue resulted in residents of these states being refused boarding on flights.

This mischief by China was a clearly belligerent move aimed at interfering with India’s sovereignty. This was their way of “staking claim” to sovereign Indian territory. 

The issue needed to be resolved soon without escalating tensions between the two countries. 

The PMO &amp; Indian diplomats started their back-channel talks in earnest. Till date, no one know the details of the pressure that Indian diplomats exerted successfully. 

What we do know is that the issue was almost resolved before Dr. Singh’s state visit to China in 2013.

Now just days before Dr. Singh’s visit, the Chinese tried their mischief again by issuing stapled visas to 2 athletes from Arunachal. 

This was pure belligerence as both countries were slated to sign a visa-liberalization agreement during Dr. Singh’s visit. 

When Dr. Singh arrived on his 2-day visit, the first thing the Indian delegation did was to raise the stapled-visa issue. 

And in a major surprise to the Chinese (who weren’t expecting it), Dr. Singh directly confronted Chinese Premier Li Keqiang &amp; demanded answers. 

On this visit by Dr. Singh, India signed 9 agreements with China. 

The most important of these was the historic Border Defense Cooperation Treaty which aimed at reducing border tensions between the two countries. 

But India held back on signing a visa agreement &amp; Dr. Singh bluntly told the Chinese Premier that the stapled visa issue was the reason for this. 

The Chinese Premier knew that this would now mean a roadblock for Chinese expats working in India especially in tech &amp; comms. 

Instead of public chest beating &amp; “laal laal aankhein”, India clearly told China that it could create visa nightmares for Chinese workers living in India. 

The Chinese Premier knew he had to back off or face consequences. 

Immediately after this visit, China stopped issuing stapled visas. This mischief was buried forever. There was no escalation of tensions &amp; no public tamasha. 

Dr. Singh subtly warned &amp; snubbed the Chinese Premier and the pressure worked. We got what we wanted. 

Until Doklam under Modi, the Indo-China border remained peaceful. Stapled visas stopped. The Chinese PLA began cooperating with the Indian Army as agreed upon in the Border Agreement. 

All of this was achieved without any hyper-toxic hyperbole &amp; public drama.

Modi can’t do this. His megalomania doesn’t allow him to. He’ll sabotage foreign policy just to look like a hero to his hyper-toxic masculine supporters. 

And his actions make life difficult for our diplomats who have to be in damage-control mode perpetually. 

We talk a lot about former Indian PMs like Nehru ji who were international statesmen. 

However, not much has been reported about the excellent &amp; impeccable foreign policy &amp; diplomacy skills of Dr. Manmohan Singh who was a genius at this. 

It was the same Dr. Singh who got the US to reverse the sanctions imposed under Vajpayee’s tenure after the nuclear tests. Dr. Singh made India a legitimate nuclear power with the Indo-US nuclear treaty.

Rajnath Singh, in his “let’s nuke them” hyperbole, forgets that he’s jeopardizing these efforts. 

Dr. Singh also built stellar relations with India’s neighbors. These have now been sabotaged by Modi who has alienated all of them. 

Modi is reversing a decade of India’s foreign policy successes under Dr. Singh. Why? Because Modi cares more about paid crowds fawning on him at Madison Square Gardens. His constant need for public validation contradicts the basic rules for successful diplomacy - which is to be quiet but firm &amp; resolve issues thru back-channel talks.

Example - Modi managed to piss off Myanmar when his govt. publicly revealed classified details of Indo-Myanmar joint ops in Burmese territory on the eve of a state visit. 

He jeopardized relations with  Myanmar only to give his trolls a “surgical strike” to gloat about.

Megalomania &amp; successful diplomacy do NOT go hand-in-hand. 

Instead of scuttling our foreign policy, Modi should sit down &amp; take notes from Dr. Singh on how foreign policy is to be conducted. 

That’ll happen only when Modi stops loving the sound of his own voice.

In my view, a significant number of issues that we are facing at the moment is because of the tension between the philosophical idea of India as a nation state, and the lived reality of it as anything but. A nation-state by definition, requires most of its citizens to be members of the same 'nation', by dint of a common language, ethnicity, or religion- none of which are true in India. A nation state also expects a certain level of uniformity across its populace- again something that is not applicable (or desirable) in India. It forces distinct communities to conform to the expectations of the majority (howsoever defined). In such a scenario would it help to re-conceptualize India as a 'republican empire' (with no prejudice or judgment on the use of the term 'empire'). In any imperial state, different regions and different peoples have differing relationships with the central imperium- some are closer and some are more tenuous. Would viewing India as such a republican empire help more people accept that some regions/groups might have a very different relationship to the state than others? (Again the use of the term 'empire' is not meant to be a value-judgement).",cvkjiy,,false,/r/india/comments/cvkjiy/conceptualizing_india_as_an_empire/,Politics
1566857810,noxx1234567,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cvv2cy/future_of_andhra_pradesh/,8,5,,,Future of Andhra Pradesh," There is a big  war of ideas  in Andhra  on how a capital should be developed with two contrarian models.  

First model by Chandra babu - A centralised location where all development will take place from IT industry , pharma , sports ,etc  .  The debt for this will be paid by all of Andhra . 

 It has almost no government land holding but land is pooled from farmers and given developed plots. 85% of the land is in hands of  Chandra babus community .  Proponents say we will have our own Hyderabad and Bengaluru in 15 - 20 years and the city will be the economic lifeline .

Second model -  [Siva ramakrishnan committee](https://m.jagranjosh.com/current-affairs/sivaramakrishnan-committee-submitted-report-to-union-home-ministry-on-ap-capital-1409293406-1).  

Basically a decentralized form of government by using technology ,where one area shall not be developed exclusively  .  It envisages setting up regional  zones  that should be developed  equally  depending on the locations strengths  and weaknesses .   

Proponents say development without equality is meaningless and will create regional hatred  and further divisions .

During a lecture by the police at the Anand Bhawan school about the right to raise one's voice and protest, a Class XI student, stood up and said:  

""You said we should raise our voice and protest. We know a teen was raped by a BJP leader. Everyone knows it was no accident. The truck number plate was painted black... It is one thing to protest when an ordinary person is involved, but what happens when the person is someone powerful? 
""We know no action will be taken if we protest and even if action is taken, it will be of no use. The girl is in a critical state... If we protest, how will you ensure justice? How will you guarantee my safety? What's the guarantee that nothing will happen to me,"" she further asked.

For which, ‘The police answered it with a vague “all complainants to toll-free number would be provided help”

I am not sure if this happens all the time, but recently i started noticing a gang of people making slogans against muslim's, other states and they came in full black painted omni van with orange highlights. The reason i am so concerned is because, my place is just a town not even city, and the place they did this was a really busy with huge people moving area. More over apart from the worst thing they do, they are allowed to stand in very busy traffic area with police permission and protection. if anyone know more about this, please enlighten me.",csswau,,false,/r/india/comments/csswau/recently_i_am_noticing_gang_of_people_shouting/,Politics
1566297861,insen2000,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cswj9h/the_witchs_broth/,237,640,,,The witch's broth,"The words, ""Taj Mahal was not built by Shahjahan. It was a Shiva temple."" still rings in my ears. My aunt who never had anything beyond primary school education told me so when I was a kid. My grandmother who never went to school knew that the first atom bomb was detonated in Kurukshetra during the battle between Pandavas and Kauravas in Mahabharata. Apparently, this is why not a shred of grass grows in Kurukshetra. Of course, she had not been to Kurukshetra and she had no idea about nuclear physics. But as a child, I had no reason to doubt their wisdom.

It is said that ignorance is bliss. But I firmly believe that ignorance is a curse. It corrupts the mind of the people. Our ignorant grandparents, uncles and aunts, parents have systematically, though not necessarily deliberately, shoved us towards ignorance and false pride. Their inadequate knowledge blended with haughty confidence has rendered most Indians into pompous fools.

These fools were relegated mostly to tasks that did not need intellectual acumen. They did their servile jobs and nurtured the pride that Ganesha had the first plastic surgery. They did their thankless duties and passed on their ignorance to their children. But someday, these fools had to come to prominence and they did. They started winning elections.

The electoral system is terribly flawed. It allows ignorants, uneducated people, idiots to become candidates and since power and money are all that is required, these imbeciles inevitably win elections. But it is not just power and money. People vote. If the people are uneducated, they would not know the value of education and they would help elect ignorants. And so they did. They elected those who would tell them how great a people they are and how quickly they would lead the world. In other words, they elected those who would give them the illusion of becoming a superpower or *Vishwaguru*.

Now that the ignoramus became leaders, it was no longer required to surreptitiously suggest that Newton did not discover the laws of gravity. The buffoons started finding Indic greatness in just about everything and made it their sacred duty to vomit their crazy thoughts publicly. They started investing effort in meaningless researches such as finding the suitability of Sanskrit in programming talking computers. But I hold responsible not just those who never went to school, for being ignorant. Such is the pathetic condition of the education system in India that having MS in Physics is also not enough to make a person educated in Physics or else why would a former lecturer of physics claim that Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is found in Vedas? Why would a judge claim that peacocks reproduce with their tears? Why would another judge declare that Brahmins are born twice? Why would an MBBS claim that the Vedas postulated a theory superior to Albert Einstein's theory of relativity? These people did go to schools and universities. But unfortunately, these schools and universities failed to give them an education. These universities washed off their hands having given these duffers just their qualification. I blame the worthless education system of India for the burden of ignorance these cretins carry exactly on their shoulders as much I hold responsible the ignorant parents these people had.

When ignorants come to power, they lead the country towards intellectual bankruptcy. It heralds the onset of disaster for a nation. Such a scenario was seen during the 1930s in Germany when the Nazis came to power. They claimed weird and unfounded theories about science, anthropology and history. They invested time, manpower and money in worthless researches. They promoted occultism and pseudoscience. They made racial laws based on pseudo-Darwinism.

When ignorants achieve power, they also want glory. They cook up stories of a great past that have made them a great race. It pumps false pride and prejudices in the people. It propels society towards collective lunacy. To assert their perceived supremacy, such a deluded nation ends up declaring war on other nations. Whether India follows such a destructive path or not, will be seen in a very near future. But the symptoms are already visible. There is a witch's broth being cooked, a diabolical concoction of patriotism, pseudoscience, the glorification of the past, nationalism, occultism, militarism and ignorance. India is going down a slippery slope.",cswj9h,,false,/r/india/comments/cswj9h/the_witchs_broth/,Politics

But 32,000 families in the Narmada Valley have still not been rehabilitated.","The Sardar Sarovar has been one of the most violent and unjust episodes of our country's recent history. It has displaced lakhs of people without fair rehabilitation and compensation. And is submerging many thousands of hectares of forests and fertile agricultural land.

Tomorrow, the Narmada Control Authority is meeting in Delhi to give permission to go ahead with this unbelievable decision. This despite multiple Supreme Court orders that people should not be displaced until they are rehabilitated. Narmada Bachao Andolan will be in Delhi to protest this decision.

The Gujarat CM is [celebrating](https://twitter.com/vijayrupanibjp/status/781510316161110016?lang=en) this tragedy as a moment of pride and [inaugurating ecotourism activities](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/now-enjoy-river-rafting-on-narmada-throughout-the-year/articleshow/70719393.cms) on the Narmada.

I thought this was very odd, usually the instructions are to keep them open while landing and taking off. But it went further than that. Someone on the flight tried to open the shutter while taking off and the cabin crew almost flipped out, they made repeated announcements and then one of them actually walked up to make sure it was closed! I have never seen a crew member walking while take off!

I asked one of them later why these instructions, they shrugged it off and just said that they have these instructions from their superiors so I couldn't get much.

1565938778,twinu89,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cr2rg7/a_short_review_of_josy_josephs_a_feast_of/,24,186,,,"A short review of Josy Joseph's ""A Feast of Vultures"" and why every Indian should read it","I happened to see an interview with Josy Joseph on Newslaundry.com sometime in 2016 or 2017, which made me curious and led me to purchase his book. It was only now that I could actually read it. People like Joseph is a rare breed in India today, people who risk everything to investigate the corrupt and the powerful, and for this very reason, if not just for the explosive contents and great writing, every Indian must read Josy Joseph. 

This book is divided into three sections. The first one talks about the ""middlemen"", people from all walks of life, from a peon in a Government office to Union Cabinet Ministers and Corporate and Underworld criminals, middlemen are the ones who essentially keep our democracy running, albeit for their own benefit. Anything and everything can be accomplished if you know who to approach to get things moving and if you have the resources required. In particular, I liked the second chapter about the famous personal assistants (PAs) of our famous politicians. By playing the trusted confidant and gatekeepers of the big and the powerful, these PAs became hyper-important just by association.

The second section talks about India's aviation industry and is my favorite part of the book. It is full of exciting details about the inner workings and despite being non-fiction, it made me read it with the excitement of fiction. As cliche as it sounds, truth is often stranger than fiction. It talks about India's entrepreneurial spirit, the Government, the criminal underworld and how our premier investigation agencies are just toys at the hands of the powerful. I highly recommend this book just for this section.

Finally, the last section talks about India's super-rich and how they became what they are. It talks about the Mallyas, the Jindals, the Saharas, the Adanis and last but most prominent, the Ambanis. The last chapter, ""A House for Mr. Ambani"" was a great read.

I appreciate the courage of the author to name and shame such big and powerful names in India. But he knows what he is talking about and is not just making things up. His investigations have led to several big talking points in India's current affairs and we need more people like him to be India's conscience keepers. I highly recommend this book to everyone who would like to have a reality check of India's celebrated democracy.

[Goa tourist taxi owners are on strike since Aug 2](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-travelling-to-goa-taxis-are-on-strike-heres-what-you-should-know-5876609/)

[Self-drive ""rent a cab"" association is supporting the strike](https://www.heraldgoa.in/Goa/Cabbies-to-surrender-en-masse-over-26000-taxi-permits-/149661) \- so you wouldn't find any self-drive cars too from today!

There are shuttle services operated by the state transport to Panjim, Margao, Calangute and Baga at affordable rates from the airport, railway station - I noticed them even in the middle of the night in the airport at 130AM today. However, you may have trouble finding connectivity for the last mile. Ask your hotels if they are providing pick-up and drop facilities. Keep yourself updated with the taxi situation before your arrival. 

[Yellow-black taxis might have withdrawn the strike from today](https://navhindtimes.in/yellow-and-black-taxi-operators-at-dabolim-to-call-off-strike-today/) \- I'll update this situation in the evening after visiting the airport.

Edit 645PM: No yellow black taxis available. Kadamba buses are the primary mode of transport. Saw some cabbies at the airport, probably the Goa miles ones. Scooter for rent available in cities.

Edit 8 Aug: Not really sure if this will be read, but Yellow black taxis will be available from tomorrow.

Edit 9 AUG: [Taxis resume operations](http://epaper.heraldgoa.in/viewpage.php?edition=oHeraldo&amp;edid=OHERALDO_GOA&amp;date=2019-08-09&amp;pn=1#Page/3/Article/OHERALDO_GOA_20190809_3_2/258.59166666666664px/13B131E)",cm7k9t,,false,/r/india/comments/cm7k9t/if_you_have_made_plans_to_visit_goa_during_the/,Politics

What strange idea of a unified nation are you celebrating when the decisions (some of which are yet to be formalized into effect) to alter an entire state's present and future were taken without its citizens' consent or even knowledge, amid a total blackout of communication services and lockdown on personal movement, so that the state's own people had no idea (and many might still not) what was going on until after the rest of the world? If this ever happens to you, I'd like to know how celebratory you feel.

2. What bold move are you celebrating when the only way this could have been done was in total secrecy and by silencing any voice of dissent from the state, by placing leaders under arbitrary house arrest? What courage does it take to silence and subjugate everyone and then make your move unimpeded?   

3. What historic step are you celebrating – the one that has set such a dangerous precedent for Constitutional principles and democracy, the one that has trampled all over human rights?

4. What is this #KashmirHamaraHai that you are shouting about? Is Kashmir just a piece of land to you, one to be annexed and forced into submission by trickery and without the consent or knowledge of the people who actually live on that land? Are you honestly just so excited about buying that retirement home in Sonamarg or Pahalgam that you've forgotten basic humanity?

5. What development opportunities are you so looking forward to – the arbitrary use of UAPA to arrest any protestor on charges of terrorism?

6. What firm message against terrorism are you celebrating - do you not see that this is smoke and mirrors to distract from the fact that the economy is doing so poorly?

7. Even if you genuinely believe that 370 and 35A need to go and that bifurcation is somehow going to be useful, is there any need to be so ridiculously insensitive to the absolute fear and panic within which all of this is unfolding, the fact that people have been unable to speak with their parents, unable to find out if they are even alive? You might argue the end justifies the means – that is, if you're even thinking about the means at all. But the next time something like this happens – and make no mistake, there will be a next time, and it won't always be in far-flung Assam or Kashmir that don't directly affect you or your family – think about how you reacted today.

Edit: This is a post from Facebook. I am not the one who wrote this. I shared it here because I found it raised some important questions, and we should put ourselves into their skin before taking sides. Or if there are indeed times when you can't take a side, then this is probably one of those for me. Also, I don't doubt the intent of the government, but I can not support the undemocratic way in which this whole thing was carried out.",cml5qs,,false,/r/india/comments/cml5qs/to_everyone_so_loudly_celebrating_today_ask/,Politics
1565074655,iheartsubmariner,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cmn8yy/amidst_all_this_uproar_about_kashmir_being_fully/,12,11,,,"Amidst all this uproar about Kashmir being fully integrated into India, one key element is being missed. The Governor of Jammu and Kashmir LIED on TV during prime time.","The media simply lapped it up without any kind of analyses, and I remember at least one channel (was it Aaj Tak?) praising the dude before they even began interviewing him about the the recent events.

What were the lies he said?

1. The troop movement was not unusual, that it was a change of guard, that there was a heightened terror threat
2. That NITs holidays were supposed to start so we started them a few days earlier, but other schools were not shut
3. That there was no curfew being implemented and people were free to move around
4. That Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti were spreading a message of fear
5. That the centre was not planning anything suspicious in the state, which he quickly changed to not receiving any information that the centre was planning anything suspicious in the state in the interview.

Proof:

1. The size of the mobilisation is unusual and came at an unusual time. Take a look [at this article](https://m.rediff.com/news/column/india-has-700000-troops-in-kashmir-false/20180717.htm). It says that of the total 470000 troops stationed in J&amp;K (including state forces) only 210000 are army personnel. Of these, two divisions are stationed in Kashmir, which amounts to up to 60000 personnel, and another thirty battalions, or roughly 30000 troops from the Rashtriya Rifles are stationed. That brings the number to 90000 troops. Add to that another 60000 troops from the CAPF. So all in all around 150000 central troops are present in Kashmir at any given time, exc. As of yesterday some 46000 additional troops have been sent there, bringing up the number by 30%. Lets not forget that out of those 150k troops, a large chunk guards the LOC. So the visible troop strength in Kashmir actually doubles.
2. Well, all schools have been shut now. This is an indisputable fact.
3. Section 144 of the CrPC begs otherwise, and people were right to stock up on rations.
4. They obviously had credible information that Kashmir's status was going to be affected, which would incite fear after surprise.
5. He is [on record](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/28-000-more-troops-deployed-in-kashmir-valley-1576280-2019-08-02) saying that Article 35A would not be scrapped.

Given the blitz with which this entire process was carried out, I cannot believe that the governor was not in the loop.

Ajit Doval [had visited the valley](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/28-000-more-troops-deployed-in-kashmir-valley-1576280-2019-08-02) at the end of July, and within a week or so of his leaving additional troops started being stationed there. It is very conceivable that he met the governor and apprised him of their plans.

I mean, the reports on the troop deployment kept mentioning that Kashmir's status could change based on inputs from 'top sources'. This isn't mere speculation. The TV media is already subservient to the government, and spared no effort to thrash any voices raising concerns over what the centre was up to, that everything was fine.

This isn't a defence for Article 370. It is simply a criticism of a constitutional figure.",cmn8yy,,false,/r/india/comments/cmn8yy/amidst_all_this_uproar_about_kashmir_being_fully/,Politics

&gt;RAW, ISI , Pakistan Government(PG), Govt of India(GoI) , US Govt, Taliban

Some facts first :

* Trump is in deep waters if he loses 2020 elections, may even go to jail. He wants a win badly, to sell to his vote base . His focus :
   * Trade deal with China.They are not budging
   * Nuclear Deal with North Korea, thats why his chummy messages for Kim-jong-un. They are not budging either. Just recently they conducted missile tests.
   * Iran. Not happening fast enough. All other against pulling out of the deal.
   * Mexico : Wall not happening.
   * Afghanistan. He wants to pull out all his troops from there.
* Out of all these, Afghanistan one seems most doable, since it only requires a deal with Taliban. A non-govt entity, which cant wait it out to end Trump's tenure.

So how come India and Kashmir gets into this particular picture ?

Trump wants to pull out  from Afghanistan since they have realized that they are fighting a losing war in Afghanistan, against Taliban, like Vietnam war(many parallels here : Nixon--&gt;Trump ; Kissinger--&gt; Zalmay Khalizad ; VietCong --&gt; Taliban). Now to get Taliban to talks, they need someone with sway over them, so enters Pakistan. If Pakistan /ISI is able to break a deal between Taliban and US, they would get into good books of Trump, hence renewal of Aid, removal of sanctions (FATF).

5 July, RAW Chief briefs PMO that US and Taliban could reach an agreement by 1st September. So if we want to get full control of Kashmir, the time is now. Because Trump may choose to reward Pakistan by meddling in this front. He already knows the situation (Courtsy Balakot, and Abhinandan's release negotiations. US govt was involved, Trump announced the 'good news' before Pakistan).

Direct quote from HT times article :

*.... following which Washington could choose to reward Islamabad for its role with the resumption of military and economic aid. That could lead to an intensification of Islamabad’s direct and indirect sponsorship of terror groups operating in Kashmir. If India had to make the move on J&amp;K’s special status that was on the government’s agenda, there wasn’t a lot of time to lose.*

22-23 July : Biggest blunder by Trump . Imran Khan was visiting US. And Trump said Modi has personally asked him to mediate on Kashmir, a claim refuted first by US state officials themselves. then by Indian officials. This was the final nail in the coffinn by thr US, clearly indicating a deal between US govt and Pak Govt could actually happen on Kashmir. Time to take action was now, or this could get really ugly in coming years (internationally)

So, what happened next ?

India sent Satellite phones and Heron drones in Kashmir.

Increased number of troops.

Closed Amarnath Yatra.

GOT FULL CONTROL OF KASHMIR, IN FORM OF UNION TERRITORY.

We can discuss all the legal, moral aspects of the manoeuvres done to achieve that (Curfew,house arrests, comm blackout etc.), but for GOI, it was now or never. And they choose now.

I realized that partial autonomy under India is much more preferable to living under sharia, Pakistanis rule or being invaded by China or Pakistan post theoretical independence .

But now I have lost all faith in thienindian government and a large part of the Indian populace .


* a monumental descion was taken without any direct or indirect involvement of the Kashmiri people . You claim kashmir is atoot and,but the warm Kashmiri bodies are an afterthought. 



* forget about involvement,  you basically confined them in an open-air prison. No landline no cellphones no internet . Not even the dignity of TV news so they can learn their own fate .



* most of my friends are toting the exact propaganda that was spewed by the Jan sangh - debelopmant will fix everything  and that kashmirs don't know what's good for them . The fiasco with the facx machine in the governor's office was a smart ploy to delay government formation. 


* the Indian public largely has no malice. But the right wing juices that they have been marinated with over past 5 years have now permeated thinking and is now a dangerous mixture of chuthiyapa and overconfidence and love for paternalism.  Many of my FB friends are solely celebrating( more out of navieness) the fact that one can buy land in kashmir and soon will become the land of milk and honey .the more toxic one are straight up calling this revenge on muslims and eagerly awaiting the demographic shifts.



*Big brother knows what's best for us . Thus is what pains me the most . They have gladly accepted, nay, cheered the onset of authoritarianism.  Modiji knows best to override all constitutional formalities  and representatives . He jailed ex-CMs of the state who were widely considered puppets of the Indian government.  This has happed to Kashmir today. any other state is fair game . He may even do more and more tyrannical acts and people will cheer him on , blinded by the illusion of development and  hate for the ""other ""And I'm sure people will cheer even then . 


No where in the world do you have young people cheering on internet and communication censorship and dictatorial tendencies . I weep for the future of Kashmir and the future of India.

*To: The Punjab Governor

Sir, With due respect, we beg to bring to your kind notice the following:

That we were sentenced to death on 7th October 1930 
by a British Court, L.C.C Tribunal, constituted 
under the Sp. Lahore Conspiracy Case Ordinance, 
promulgated by the H.E. The Viceroy, the Head of the
British Government of India, and that the main charge
against us was that of having waged war against
H.M. King George, the King of England.

The above-mentioned finding of the Court pre-supposed two things:

Firstly, that there exists a state of war between the 
British Nation and the Indian Nation and, secondly, 
that we had actually participated in that war 
and were, therefore, war prisoners.

The second pre-supposition seems to be a little bit 
flattering, but nevertheless, it is too tempting to 
resist the desire of acquiescing in it.

As regards the first, we are constrained to go 
into some detail. Apparently, there seems to be 
no such war as the phrase indicates.

Nevertheless, please allow us to accept the validity
of the pre-supposition taking it at its face value. 
But in order to be correctly understood, we must 
explain it further.

Let us declare that the state of war does exist and 
shall exist so long as the Indian toiling masses and
the natural resources are being exploited by a handful 
of parasites.

They may be purely British capitalist or mixed British 
and Indian or even purely Indian. They may be carrying 
on their insidious exploitation through mixed or even 
on purely Indian bureaucratic apparatus. 
All these things make no difference.

No matter, if your government tries and succeeds in 
winning over the leaders of the upper strata of the 
Indian society through petty concessions and compromises
and thereby cause a temporary demoralisation in the 
main body of the forces.

No matter, if once again the vanguard of the Indian movement,
the Revolutionary Party, finds itself deserted in the thick of the war.

No matter if the leaders to whom personally we are 
much indebted for the sympathy and feelings they 
expressed for us, but nevertheless we cannot overlook
the fact that they did become so callous as to ignore
and not to make a mention in the peace negotiation of
even the homeless, friendless and penniless of female
workers who are alleged to be belonging to the vanguard
and whom the leaders consider to be enemies of their 
utopian non-violent cult which has already become a 
thing of the past; the heroines who had ungrudgingly 
sacrificed or offered for sacrifice their husbands, 
brothers, and all that were nearest and dearest to them,
including themselves, whom your government has declared to be outlaws.

No matter, if your agents stoop so low as to fabricate
baseless calumnies against their spotless characters 
to damage their and their party’s reputation.

The war shall continue.

It may assume different shapes at different times. 
It may become now open, now hidden, now purely agitational,
now fierce life and death struggle.

The choice of the course, whether bloody or comparatively 
peaceful, which it should adopt rests with you. Choose whichever
you like. But that war shall be incessantly waged without 
taking into consideration the petty (illegible) and the 
meaningless ethical ideologies.

It shall be waged ever with new vigour, greater audacity 
and unflinching determination till the Socialist Republic 
is established and the present social order is completely 
replaced by a new social order, based on social prosperity
and thus every sort of exploitation is put an end to and 
the humanity is ushered into the era of genuine and permanent peace.

In the very near futur, the final battle shall be 
fought and final settlement arrived at.

The days of capitalist and imperialist exploitation 
are numbered. The war neither began with us nor is it 
going to end with our lives. It is the inevitable 
consequence of the historic events and the existing environments.

Our humble sacrifices shall be only a link in the chain 
that has very accurately been beautified by the unparalleled
sacrifice of [Jatin] Das and most tragic but noblest 
sacrifice of Comrade Bhagawati Charan and the glorious 
death of our dear warrior [Chandrashekhar] Azad.

As to the question of our fates, please allow us to say that
when you have decided to put us to death, you will certainly do it.

You have got the power in your hands and the power
is the greatest justification in this world.

We know that the maxim “Might is right” serves as
your guiding motto. The whole of our trial was just a proof of that.

We wanted to point out that according to the verdict 
of your court we had waged war and were therefore war prisoners.
And we claim to be treated as such, i.e.,
we claim to be shot dead instead of to be hanged.

It rests with you to prove that you really meant what your court has said.

We request and hope that you will very kindly order 
the military department to send its detachment to perform our execution.

Yours,
BHAGAT SINGH

* No transparency

* Authoritarianism/No power to people

* Human rights violations

* Government openly lying

* IT Cell working at full capacity to spread anti-muslim(or anyone who oppose RSS/BJP) hatred/rumors

* Use of pellet guns

* Rape (I don't have proof, but i know it's been happening, although this can be omitted from the list on the basis of No proof)

* murder (This one, you decide)

But it's something else that made me write all this, this : [How Kashmiri Children Are Being ‘Picked Up’ in Night Raids by Security Forces Across Kashmir](https://www.thequint.com/news/india/kashmir-situation-night-raids-children-article-370-srinagar-pulwama)

A parent won't have any difficulty to understand this : if your child's life are at stake then 9/10 parents won't care about law/rules/regulation/government atall, it's not even in your control to think about law it's just your body's reaction.

**Now here is the thing :** As we and the whole world knows pakistan's primary defense/offence is terrorism, it's part of who they are (it's indoctrinated through the web of madrasahs, just read about hafiz saeed).

All they have to do is transport guns and weapons to kashmir, **Before** this whole mess, the people of kashmir wouldn't accept any such weapon at large. But now they don't know if they are safe or not, and specially they don't know if their kids are safe or not. 
**Now** i think most of the kashmiris would accept weapons if they had a chance. Pakistan Govt. and army both would be more than eager to do this.

And then only a fire is needed to start a wildfire (something like Kathua rape case). 

**If kashmiris pick up arms against government now. would/should it be considered terrorism?**

I know it would be considered terrorism for sure because that's what government would call it and media would scream, if BJP/RSS can arrest activist who fight for villagers and other communities who don't have any voice In a cooked up case of terrorism([This](https://thewire.in/politics/modi-assassination-plot-letter-danger-democracy))  than i am pretty sure they would be called terrorist.

Why are Indian officials silent over the matter and are not trying to take advantage of the situation?

These protests have been going on from a long time now and are truly massive in scale. If we could help out Hong-kong in this this case then it might help out with Tibet, Kashmir border and some other issues.

There is be the possibility that the protestors are being manipulated by hidden interest groups but the situation really is strange.

This is not a party that wants any good for you. Please don't get fooled by the type of politics that is being played. Wake up and smell the coffee. Read history. Read about these organizations and their agendas. I'm not telling you to vote for Congress neither am I a Pakistani (anti national) preaching hate just to see my country in thrash. For God sake stop this nonsense. 


I request and plead my fellow citizens to start taking immediate stances and fight for the country by spreading the truth. What's happening across the nation is traumatizing. People are being lynched , economy is crashing , the media has been lying about the situation in kashmir and so on. I was expecting this page to be biased to one common agenda but it turned out to be much open than the Pak one. When I questioned in the Pak page about the stances and double standards of their govt, I got suspended from posting. This subreddit here has been a major model that allows both sides of the coin an equal share! 


There have already been so many people showing concern towards the path that we have taken. It's a major crisis as we all know. It is the essence of democracy to speak truth to the power and this must be done no matter what! 
We have a whole generation to look after and we can't afford any kind of war or b.s now!


The Kaveri river has been calling us. It's drying out! Floods have become a frequent tragic every year and it's on us my people to save the nation. Imagine what would happen if a war occurs! Imagine the after effects. These are not the medieval or ancient times where people fought with swords and arrows. We have nuclear weapons on either side. Imagine the after effects of a WAR.  Imagine how many of our jawaans and citizens will loose their lives. 



We as a nation stand by our jawaans, THATS FOR SURE. AND WE SHOULD! But the political elite have been manipulating their positions in the eyes of the people. DONT LET THIS HAPPEN. 



The least you can do now is speak the truth. The truth in the end of the day always wins! So keep all your biases aside and see your fellow citizens who endures the same hardships as you and start becoming responsible citizens.


I might have missed a few important points so feel free to merge in your thoughts in the comments below.

Highlights of this article being :

1. Jawaharlal Nehru was the only man who could have reached out to Abdullah. Had it not been for Nehru convincing Abdullah, **there would have been no Kashmir and no Kashmir question.**
2. SP Mukherjee was **for partition.**
3. The Sangh only wanted Jammu, not Kashmir ( a position which is completely justified ).

In the Kashmir posts I had mentioned that Pakistan is interested in Kashmir not just because of religion but because of water as well. People did not believe me..

Edit 2: Pakistan doesn't give a rat's ass about Kashmir, it's people or its Azadi. The only thing it cares about is water, well it's not the only thing, but it's the thing which matters the most to them. 

Since such critical rivers and other critical glaciers fall in Kashmir, I think it is an unfair demand that the Kashmiris have of 'Azadi'. They are surrounded by three nuclear powers and their lands have the critical resource of water. No way the Pakistanis or Chinese are going to leave them. They dont care aboy Kashmiris all they care about are the resources that Kashmir's brings along with them .",ctds8y,,false,/r/india/comments/ctds8y/work_to_stop_water_from_flowing_into_pakistan_has/,Politics

1565260035,captainpisspot,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cnjtne/my_take_on_the_abrogation_of_art_370/,1,14,,,My take on the abrogation of art 370.,"Well, this topic seemed too tasty, not to insert my f***ing big nose in it..

A. Abrogating 370, without the consent of JnKs constituent assembly might be a ""veritable treachery"" on the constitutional sanctity itself. But we all know Jnk constituent assembly doesn't exist. 

B. For all the hue and cry on women rights, refer to susheela swahney judgment by JnK HC. Regarding ""permanent residential"" status of women married to non JnK people.Article 370 itself is gender neutral, but the definition of Permanent Residents in the State Constitution — based on the notifications issued in April 1927 and June 1932 during the Maharajah’s rule — was thought to be discriminatory. 

C. Unemployment in india has reached decadal highs, our honbl home minister doesn't believe its that big a problem. What kind of pink elixir in blue bottles is being sold, that is expected to cure the problem in a state, where public administration contributes the maximum towards GSDP growth?

D. Abrogating 35A, and leaving 370 as a negotiation tool would have been a better way forward, to me. But then, there exists 371 that forbids you from buying agri land in himachal pradesh, and our so ""progressive legislators"" are prolly a bit blind on it.

E. Delving into historical statements, would need a historically particularist approach. The difference that vallabhai patel and Jawaharlal nehru and ambedkar had on this issue is, very well documented. Let alone this, their stances on even integrating kashmir was different.  

Nehru was undoubtedly idealistic and romantic about Kashmir. He wrote: “Like some supremely beautiful woman, whose beauty is almost impersonal and above human desire, such was Kashmir in all its feminine beauty of river and valley...” Patel had a much more earthy and pragmatic view and — as his masterly integration of princely states demonstrated — little time for capricious state leaders or their separatist tendencies.

But while Ayyangar negotiated — with Nehru’s backing — the substance and scope of Article 370 with Sheikh Abdullah and other members from J&amp;K in the Constituent Assembly (including Mirza Afzal Beg and Maulana Masoodi), Patel was very much in the loop. And while Patel was deeply sceptical of a “state becoming part of India” and not “recognising ... [India’s] fundamental rights and directive principles of State policy,” he was aware of, and a party to, the final outcome on Article 370.

Negotiations Indeed, the synergy that Patel and Nehru brought to governing India is evident in the negotiations over Article 370. Consider this. In October 1949, there was a tense standoff between Sheikh Abdullah and Ayyangar over parts of Article 370 (or Article 306A as it was known during the drafting stage). Nehru was in the United States, where — addressing members of the U.S. Congress — he said: “Where freedom is menaced or justice threatened or where aggression takes place, we cannot be and shall not be neutral.” Meanwhile, Ayyangar was struggling with the Sheikh, and later even threatened to resign from the Constituent Assembly. “You have left me even more distressed than I have been since I received your last letter … I feel weighted with the responsibility of finding a solution for the difficulties that, after Panditji left for America ... have been created … without adequate excuse,” he wrote to the Sheikh on October 15. And who did Ayyangar turn to, in this crisis with the Sheikh, while Nehru was abroad? None other than the Sardar himself. Patel, of course, was not enamoured by the Sheikh, who he thought kept changing course. He wrote to Ayyangar: “Whenever Sheikh Sahib wishes to back out, he always confronts us with his duty to the people.” But it was Patel finally who managed the crisis and navigated most of the amendments sought of the Sheikh through the Congress party and the Constituent Assembly to ensure that Article 370 became part of the Indian Constitution.



F. Both dixon, an Australian lawyer serving in UN and ambedkar after quitting law ministry did ask for trifurcation of kashmir. Ambedkar was also in favor of, ""plebiscite"" on the valley question. Kashmir plebiscite however isn't possible since the first condition to it, pak army withdrawal hasn't happened. Karachi and simla agreement, and probably, a read of the papers of accession by raja hari singh would be a greater source of info on the stand of India, than delving into personal opinions. Right wing, suitably forgets ambedkars stand on plebiscite

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.thehindu.com/news/national/idea-of-dividing-kashmir-has-a-chequered-history/article28839008.ece/amp/
Also read, the great partition, by yasmin khan.

G. If economics decided secessionist tendencies, Basque and catalunya would have never happened. Further, if a high handed attitude was enough to stop secessionist tendencies, hmm, good luck with that. From muktijoddhas in Bangladesh to Kosovo, the history is .... Well, rife with examples.

H. Lalkar campaigns, kathua,  this 

https://thewire.in/women/vikram-saini-bjp-kashmir-article-370

Makes me highly skeptical about the motives of ""women and children development""

I. Lastly, as long as the average kashmiri identifies himself as a kashmiri and not an indian, and as long as we keep on making our red piling memes on ""you kashmir, you bad"", things won't solve. A top down implementation never helps. That, the sangh has assimiliatory tendencies is beyond question. NRC, conducted in the name of ""removing immigrants"" has become a shitshow.

J. What if, I say, all this, is just realpolitik... Diverting the attention of the masses from a recession knocking on the door (RBI : lets cut the repo rate further)... And , just like demonetisation, creating a whirlwind of jingoistic fervor? They called me an idiot when I said demonetisation would flop, in 2016, in 2019, half of them have come to terms with the fact that no good came out of it.

I would prefer, in the words of economist thaler, a ""nudge""..too hard a pull might break this string.

I. Exterior - Lal Chowk - Day

The police move around in groups. The state is on high alert. The two previous chief ministers along with around two hundred of political leaders have been either been put in house arrest or taken to jail. The mobile and telephone networks are down. TV connections have been cut off. There is no radio or newspapers. Curfew has been declared in many parts. The constitutional right to small assembly of people has been revoked. Schools are closed. Not sure if hospitals are closed too. Panic in the air is so thick that you could cut it with a knife. There are news reporters but they have no means of transmitting their reports.
Thousands of miles away people gather on streets. They beat dhols and celebrate with fire crackers. They chant ‘Bharat Mata ki Jai’ and declare victory and they go back to their homes and settle in front of the TV before the India Vs. Windies T20 match begins.

II. Exterior - Lal Chowk - Day.

A young man stands on a platform and the crowd gathers. He is wearing an assortment of clothes with a cut off hangman's noose around his neck, a radio on a sling and he stands and addresses the crowd. 
""Hello...Hello...Mic testing one, two, three...Can you hear me? Hello...
UN council resolution number 47 of 1948, article 2 of the Geneva Convention and article 370 of the Indian constitution, Raises but one question!
Do we exist or do we not? If we do... then who are we? If not... then where are we? Did we exist at all? Or not?
Chutzpah is our problem. Do you know what chutzpah means?
Once upon a time a bank was robbed. Pointing the gun at the cashier, the burglar threatened, 'give me the money or die.' The cashier gave him all the money.
He went to the next counter, whistling on the way, and asked the man to open an account for him. That is chutzpah. Such audacity, such stupidity. Like AFSPA…
All for Law and order...Law and order...
There is no law, there is no order.
Whose laws? Whose order? Made on order... Law and order...
India! Pakistan! A game on the border. India clings to us. Pakistan leeches on.
What of us? What do we want?
Freedom!
Freedom from this side...Freedom from that side...
- Freedom!”


Now only one of the above two scenes is from a dystopian movie depicting the sufferings inflicted on people by dysfunctional and overbearing state. The other is the state of Jammu and Kashmir in world’s largest democracy whose Preamble of the constitution in which ‘WE THE PEOPLE of INDIA’ solemnly resolve and declare, “To secure to all its citizens…. LIBERTY of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship…” also feel the need to curtail the very liberty to one and a half crore people, in pretence of maintaining Law and Order. Who are we protecting with these laws and orders? What does it say about ourselves? I can see what is says about the strength of our state, but what does it say about the strength of our beliefs? Think about it will you?",cnkcwp,,false,/r/india/comments/cnkcwp/law_and_order/,Politics

In the very beginning of His speech, He highlighted the role of Pakistan in sponsoring terrorism in the valley, quoting around 42000 lives lost since 1948. He seems quite optimistic about the move of scrapping Article 370 and 35A, which he hopes will bring prosperity to the region. With the scrapping of the bill, he hopes citizens of J&amp;K will benefit immensely. He raised the following points to the benefit of the people of J&amp;K:

1. State employees of J&amp;K will be awarded same benefits as other state employees like LTCs, HRA, Education allowance, Health insurance, etc., some of which are currently not available to them.
2. Public sector units and private sector units will be encouraged to employ more locals.
3. Government's PM Scholarship scheme will be implemented there asap.
4. Voting rights will be awarded to people who migrated from Pakistan to J&amp;K during partition.
5. The election system will remain the same as earlier where they will elect their own representatives.
6. PM has urged the film industries in India to invest more in J&amp;K.
7. He wishes to give sports a boost in the state by opening new sports academies, new stadiums, and impart science back sports knowledge.

What are your views on his  address today?

1567185099,insen2000,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cxjuui/the_confession_of_a_pseudosecular/,11,9,,,The confession of a pseudosecular,"October 31st, 1984. We heard about it from the senior students that Indira Gandhi was assassinated by her guards. The teacher told us after a couple of periods that we all had to go home. We were happy that we would not have to attend any more classes. Then he gave the reason. As he said that the Prime Minister of India was no more, most of the students pointed towards the only Sikh boy in the class and said, ""*Sir Sir, iske logon ne mara hai*"" (Sir Sir, this guy's people killed her). The thin little Sikh boy shrank in trepidation. All his friends were accusing him. We were children. We were really small children then, hardly 12 or 13 years old but we knew who belonged to which community, who was a Sikh and who was not. We knew who was a Hindu and who was a Muslim. I still remember what followed Indira Gandhi's assassination. It was bad but it was said that it was the punishment for killing Indira Gandhi and so it was okay. If it was okay for the elders, it was okay with me. 

Fast forward to 1988 -

""Can anyone tell me what is the national religion of our country?"", asked Mrs Gulati.

""Hinduism, Madam"", replied the class, almost in unison. I also said the same after scratching my head.

The withdrawn guy sitting in the last bench perhaps did not say anything and so Mrs. Gulati asked, ""Khurshid, what is the national religion of India?""

Hesitantly, Khurshid stood up, blinked his bespectacled eyes and said, ""Madam, Hinduism?""

""India is a secular country. There is no national or official religion"", said Mrs Gulati.

Class X Section A fell silent. We had no idea what was secular. It was a new word in our very limited English vocabulary. After the class ended, there was a buzz in the air. Who is secular? What is secular? When did India become secular? Are Hindus also secular? Now, when I look back to the days of 1988, I wonder why even the Christian, Sikh and Muslim students had no problem saying that the national religion of India was Hinduism. But the reasons were in front of my eyes. I just overlooked them. It did not occur to me that we chanted a Sanskrit sloka every day in the assembly. We celebrated Saraswati Puja in the school.  We were taught Ramayana and Mahabharata in the class. We studied Sanskrit instead of Urdu which was more widely spoken in India or any regional language which was more useful. Mrs Gulati's assertion that India was a secular country was just a flash in the pan. We heard the term, found it to be quite confusing and quickly forgot it. 

My personal understanding was that India was a Hindu country no matter if people wanted to call it secular. Secular was a fancy word educated people used. India was a Hindu country where others also lived. They were also Indians but they were the other Indians much like the platypus that was also a mammal but not exactly. The novel idea of secularism did not sink into my psyche for most of my age. The stereotypes did not let it happen. The Christian was either a priest with a big cross hanging from his neck or an alcoholic rolling on the beaches of Goa. The Sikh was the virtuous but not so smart alcohol-glugging, Bhangra-dancing semi-Hindu who said ""*Chak de phatte*"" with or without a reason. The Muslim was either the terrorist or the smuggler with a beard and a skull cap, who ate beef. No matter how many Sikhs, Christians and Muslims I came across in my younger days, the stereotype reigned supreme. It did not occur to me that there were more smugglers in India who were not Muslim. It did not dawn upon me that my father did not have to be a Sikh to be an alcoholic. It did not occur to me that LTTE fighters did not need to be Muslims to pioneer suicide bombing. 

My mother wore a new saree to go to the *mandap*. The loudspeakers blared vulgar Bollywood songs while children played and women queued up to pay homage to Devi Durga. My head throbbed with migraine. But I was not unhappy. Durga Puja comes once in a year. What is the harm if people have some fun. But I did not tell myself what was the harm if the loud *azaan* from the nearby mosque wake me up. ""These bloody Muslims! Can't they do their prayers without the loudspeakers? Secularism does not mean you wake up people before the dawn every day."". It is not like Durga Puja that noise pollution increases only for four days. I did not think that it was not just for four days that noise pollution increased. Kali Puja, Diwali, Laxmi Puja, Jaddhatri Puja, Dol (Holi), Janmasthami, Saraswati Puja, Shani Puja, Shiva Ratri, Vishwakarma Puja and every conceivable Puja resonated at the same decibel level and gave me a migraine. But India is a secular country and so people have the right to celebrate their festivals. My definition of secularism was a polymorphic virus. It changed its attributes and purpose. When the Babri mosque was demolished, I did not feel any pain or remorse. On the contrary, I sort of justified it to me by thinking that Babar was indeed a tyrant. It did not matter to me why Babar's being a tyrant should justify the demolition of a mosque more than 400 years after his death. I did not think about how I could not morally oppose the despicable act of thousands of hooligans and vandals. 

But as the years passed by, I became less and less of a typical uninformed and unaware Indian. I understood that secularism was not what was told to us. Secularism was not refraining from hurting others' religious sentiments. Secularism was the principle of separation between the state and the religious bodies. India was not a secular country. The state relentlessly and systematically pushed and propagated the religious sentiments of one community and it was my community. It took years but I realized that I was not secular. It takes time to change the stance. Sometimes it takes an event or an incident to change the stance.

""Go back to India. People will kill you here"", said the Chacha in Bengali. 

""Why? What happened?"", I asked.

""Hindus are killing Muslims in your country"", said Chacha, adding, ""Don't tell me later that I did not warn you. Go away tonight."".

My flight from Dhaka to Calcutta was still a week away. But I managed to get tickets and left Bangladesh that very evening without visiting my grandfather's ancestral village. It was the second night of the Gujarat pogrom. On the short flight, I cursed the Hindus of Gujarat for not letting me visit my ancestral village, the sudden fear of death I had to face, for running away like a fugitive for no crime of mine. For the first time, I felt a repugnance towards ""my people"". My people? How could those *Trishul* brandishing, *Jai Sri Ram* chanting vermins on a rampage be my people? What was common between me and those vectors of the disease of communal hatred? Wasn't that Chacha who warned me of the impending trouble ""my people"" instead? Yes, he was my people even though his nationality was different and his religion was different. A person cannot be my people just because his religion or his caste or his nationality are the same as mine.

By the time 2014 general election came, I was a proud secular. I hated the system that kept the Muslims backward by giving them a few subsidies and recognizing only the Mullahs as the representative of the community as much as I hated the burgeoning majoritarianism of the Hindus. Secularism had to be redefined. It can no longer be sucking up to the fundamentalist elements of society. It can no longer be catering to the whims of the religious filth of the country. But it was already too late. Indians were giving up all pretensions of being secular. The term ""secular"" was becoming a cussword. 

Today when I see the hooligans in Kanwar-yatra being showered with rose petals from helicopters by police officers, when I see food-fascism by banning beef, when I see Muslims being lynched for mere suspicion of possessing beef, when I see Muslims thrashed to death for no reasons, when I see lynchers being garlanded by Harvard educated ministers, when I see the dead body of an alleged lyncher draped in tri-colour, I feel that this country needs to be truly secular. That is the only way this country can survive. 

It was our collective negligence and deliberate misinterpretation of the word ""secularism"" that today the word has become dirty and we are a proto-religious regressive fascist country, instead of a secular socialist progressive democracy.  Our children, the future generation will curse us, spit on us for what we have done to our motherland. It is now our duty to bring this nation back from the brinks of ruination.",cxjuui,,false,/r/india/comments/cxjuui/the_confession_of_a_pseudosecular/,Politics

1566592659,fencesitter076,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cujk35/karan_thapar_and_prof_faizan_mustafa_on_article/,28,75,,,Karan Thapar and Prof Faizan Mustafa on Article 370; My TLDW Version,"Karan Thapar did an interview for *The Wire* with Prof Faizan Mustafa, Vice Chancellor of NALSAR Hyderabad on the legal questions surrounding the dilution of article 370. [Here’s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiKuTsnR4VM) the link and following is my TLDW version of it.

Although I highly recommend watching this interview for the legal nitty-gritties, I have transcribed and paraphrased the operational parts of the interview here because I felt it will help greatly to counter and clarify some of the systematic misinformation provided about the whole matter. I have taken all the details there in good faith and haven’t independently cross-checked everything. If there are errors, please point out and we’ll have an addendum.

Here are some of the key takeaways from the interview:

**The Possibility of Supreme Court’s Intervention**

Any call the Supreme Court might take on the dilution of 370 is unlikely to have an effect, because a consideration by a Constitutional bench would arrive at a verdict only a few years down the line, by when a restoration would be redundant.

On the matter of the bifurcation of the state, again, even if the court might recognize the right of an elected assembly’s ‘views’ on the matter, the only consequence will be that elections would have to be held, the state assembly will likely express its dissent, and as was the case with Telangana bifurcation, the Centre can then choose to ignore the assembly’s views and proceed with the bifurcation.

**\[Minutes** [19:24 - 31:42](https://youtu.be/YiKuTsnR4VM?t=1163) **of the interview\] How much of the Indian Constitution actually applies to Kashmir? (This is the most useful part of the interview. Please at least watch these 12 minutes)**

Simple Answer: ""Almost the entire Constitution"". 260 articles of the Indian Constitution have been extended to J &amp; K, 94 out of 97 subjects in which the Centre can legislate are already applicable to J &amp; K. Of the130 articles that remain, Kashmir’s Constitution has articles identical to those in the Indian Constitution on a vast majority of them, such as the ones on the powers of speaker, deputy speaker, governor’s oath and privileges, anti-defection laws, all in Prof. Mustafa’s words “absolutely identical with the Indian Constitution.”

Since 1950, article by article, several provisions of the Indian Constitution have been made applicable to the J &amp; K, including the jurisdiction of Supreme Court, powers of Comptroller and Auditor General, Central Election Commission, Article 356 (applicability of President’s Rule). As part of the States Reorganisation Bill, a total of 166 articles of J &amp; K have been retained, 164 repealed (of which many like Hindu Marriage Act, Inheritance, Adoption succession etc. were repealed because Kashmir already had them) and 106 laws have been extended over time.

That several laws enacted by the Indian parliament ~~that~~ did not apply to J &amp; K, as claimed by Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad ~~were~~ is somewhat of a myth. Those Prasad named were the Prevention of Corruption Act, Prevention of Child Marriages Act, Right to Education, Right to Information Act and the law preventing Manual Scavenging. Prof Mustafa clarifies that Kashmir Assembly had passed a 2010 law against manual scavenging, a stronger RTI (2009) with Information Commissioners’s powers equal to HC judge (whereas other Indian states have Information Commissioners equal only to the rank of Chief Secretary), and a version of POCA which he believes is stronger than the Indian Parliament’s law. RTE \[rather the Special Education Act of J &amp; K 2002\] ~~applies~~ allows for free education till the university level whereas Indian law only covers education between ages 8 and 14.

J &amp; K Constitution committed to socialism and secularism in 1956 while those terms were added to the Indian Constitution only in 1976.

**What about gender rights in J &amp; K?**

Muslim Personal Laws (Shariat Application laws) weren’t enforced in Kashmir till 2007, ~~where~~ but Kashmir was governed by Sri Pratap J &amp; K Laws Consolidation Act 1977, where Kashmiri customs had prominence over Sharia. This enabled equal inheritance to unmarried women as their male siblings, as opposed to only half in Sharia, allowed adoption which is not dealt with in MPL, compulsory marriage registrations, which are not required elsewhere in India under MPL.

A Kashmiri woman not marrying permanent resident doesn’t lose inheritance as is commonly touted, it is only that a male who is not a permanent resident of Kashmir cannot become one through marriage or acquire property. (He cites J &amp; K High Court verdict in the Susheela Sawhney case of 2016.)

**SC/ ST Reservation**

J &amp; K already has progressive provisions for reservations (1987, 2004), not exceeding 50% for SC, ST and BC in proportion to population and allows carry over of unfilled seats to the following year, unlike in rest of India. However, this applies only ~~from~~ to permanent residents from the state, and notified SC ST communities *from within* the state.

**Centre Loses Special Powers, not J &amp; K**

As opposed to what is popularly claimed, Kashmir loses little by this ‘abrogation’ than the Centre. Once “integrated” with India, all acts passed by Indian Constitution extends to J &amp; K naturally, whereas previously, it needed a specific act of extension to J &amp; K by the President. By avoiding these ‘extensions,’ the centre often had easier control in J &amp; K than in other states over legislation on state subjects (Article 249 and wider powers of Rajya Sabha), the power to extend President’s rule for up to 7 years, whereas in other states it is not permissible for more than three years. Emergency can be imposed on J &amp; K on grounds on “internal disturbance,” (a provision struck down after Indira Gandhi’s abuse of it, but a deletion not extended to J &amp; K) whereas in other states it can only be on the basis of “armed rebellion” or “external aggression.” Additional restrictions on freedom of speech over what is possible within the ambit of Article 19 etc. were possible thanks to Article 370.

**The rest of the interview** covers miscellaneous topics such as the similar provisions over land ownership in HP, Uttarakhand, the scope of Article 371 applicable to states in the North East, the primacy of Naga customary laws over other statutes unless ratified by their Assembly and even municipal level devolution of powers where an Assembly’s bills need ratification from the district authority, the possibility of the expansion of the autonomy of Nagaland as part of peace negotiations with NSCN. etc. Prof. Mustafa thinks they are perfectly justifiable given the diversity of the country.

They speculate once again over how the Supreme Court might approach the legality of the dilution of Article 370. One caveat he points out is that the loophole the Centre used, the Governor’s concurrence under President’s rule, still should have been availed under the advise of the Council of Ministers. This will remain the case even in the new setup of J &amp; K as a UT. That was not done and should ideally raise legal objections.

The relationship between land ownership for outsiders and businesses is also briefly touched upon and thought to be of mild consequence because long-term leases for 99 years and so on have already been possible in the past.

**Absolute TLDR is the following.**

**Photo taken** \- July 2019

Its very said that people who live in the village are moving to cities. Its normal now a days but after moved to cities they hardly return to own village. Who don't want visit this location, but on other hand its not its to visit there. 2 hours to climbing not a easy task. I'm heard 2 years back that govt has passed road project to reach there. But don't think it happening soon. I hope good news will come this year.  

P.S - Last time i visited there 5 years back.

1. Blogging - Too many copy cats and scrapers, current start blog articles are only to make money of you from your click via affilaite income.
2. Youtube - Too many Youtubers with clickbaity titles, YT algo will never show your genuine videos.
3. Online coaching - Every one expects a free advice
4. E-books - Pirated the next moment, you will get it back as pdf in one of your WhatsApp/Telegram groups.
5. Productivity software tools - No one values time in India, no one is will pay money for apps to save time
6. Udemy Video Courses - Pirated the next moment
7. Sell on Amazon/Flipkart - Other sellers will make fake reviews on your product listing, undercut and bleed you to death
8. Freelancing - It's a rat race down the drain, you need to have a very specialized skill to excel.
9. Do manual jobs online -Mturk/Fiverr- Indian's cant register for Mturk anymore( i wasnt able to atleast when i last tried)

It mentioned that I had cleared some subjects while others would have to be repeated. After a spate of failures here I'm desensitized to it. It doesn't feel unfamiliar. On receipt of results it's customary for my classmates to post congratulatory messages on the WhatsApp group. I'm the only student who failed. Am I ashamed of it? Hell yeah.

I'm 2 years their senior. This is because I had too many failures in core subjects. I'm confident they look down on me. They make no efforts to conceal their condescension. For most classmates I'm a non-entity. I was a buoyant young man when I joined at 18. When I graduate I'll have become a meek, complaisant, despondent mid twenties guy. I too have to take responsibility for my failure. I concede that I didn't work as hard as I should've. I was remiss. Sometimes to drown my pain, self doubt I drink. I understand that it's idiocy to resort to alcohol for relief. But I've no alternative.

I was close to my previous batchmates. But now they've progressed in life and I'm a reminder of their unpleasant phase. They cut me off. Friendless, kissless,aimless I ofen sit in my room contemplating existence. And then I'm awoken out of my stupor by my room mate. I can't afford to be involved in such rarefied practices.

Other than becoming unlovely, unattractive I've seen no change in me over the past 6 years. I've ossified. I stare at a bleak future.

I flew Air India twice over past 3 days across different metros, and one thing I saw that puzzled me were multiple male cabin attendants in unusual uniform in both the flights.

Unusual as in: They were wearing a standard shirt-tie and trouser combination. However, all of them were wearing shoulder stripes, as pilots do. All of them had the same stripe pattern (two white stripes). Also common was them wearing half wing brevet badges (Sample, not actual image for reference: [https://sc01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1RRXuHFXXXXXRXVXXq6xXFXXXS/golden-half-wing-badge-pilot-hat-badge.jpg\_350x350.jpg](https://sc01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1RRXuHFXXXXXRXVXXq6xXFXXXS/golden-half-wing-badge-pilot-hat-badge.jpg_350x350.jpg))

I didn't get an opportunity to ask them whether they were pilots or not, mainly because I thought it would be rude to do so. However I have flown AI multiple times before and never recall male cabin attendants in that get up. In fact, I don't ever recall any airline I've flown with having male cabin crew wearing stripes and aviator badges. Did Air India recently change their uniform for cabin crew or what?

PS: These were a 777 and 787 I was flying on the two occasions, and were domestic legs of long haul flights. I never flew aboard large AI planes before. Is it possible that what I saw were relief crew lending a hand in cabin management?",clwh6n,,false,/r/india/comments/clwh6n/are_air_india_first_officers_being_made_to_work/,Non-Political

I'm very picky with it.,"I was kinda burned by Bollywood movies initially because there was so little nuance and subtlety in acting and plot. Atleast compared what I'm used to. Malayalam, Hollywood, French or Bengali movies. Then I tried a few...        
   
Lootera (Basically visual+emotional+musical poetry)     
Jodha Akbar (Played out like an epic and exquisite ballad)       
October (One of the few Bollywood romances with nuance)   
Haider (That last shot of a broken man walking away...wow)   
3 Idiots (Obviously)  
Tumbadd (A brilliant engrossing dark fairytale)   
   
Bollywood is brilliant at capturing 'ideal' and epic love stories in a much poetic way than other industries do. It's not good with realism or nuance, but its's good at telling stories in broad strokes. It also tries to bank on waves of emotions too much.        
   
What are some Bollywood movies that are not too overly cheesy but still epic? I don't mean gritty films or thrillers or gangster films. Just well written movies with a decent romance arc.

They didn't buy me gifts when I was a kid because our financial condition wasn't that good. I was a brat and always complained about how I want things that my friends have and my parents don't love me enough. When I grew up, I understood my parents stance.

My mother did beat me when I was a kid. She's also slightly, just a little bit narcissistic and my dad was also a hothead because of my mischiefs. He's calm now and became quite liberal when we moved to Mumbai. My mother can still get angry sometimes and even if we fight for a day or two, everything becomes normal after that.

Overall, I can still talk to my parents about the problems I'm facing. This has largely been because I think my dad knew I had some mental health issues and he was quite supportive. My mom also stopped scolding me. Because of how I was raised, nowadays I don't really care about materialistic things except a photo which will long last and new Laptops.

Could my parents have done something else to raise me; ofcourse but poor financial conditions, shitty relatives (some are really nice though) and a workaholic father doesn't give much room for better parenting. I'd still be stuck in that naxalite shithole if it wasn't for my parents. I'm happy that somehow we're trying to mend our relationship in some way. Honestly, I have no qualms about the mistakes they made. It was just a phase at that time.",clzf3k,,false,/r/india/comments/clzf3k/looking_at_this_sub_made_me_realise_how_good_my/,Non-Political

I recently came across [this](https://twitter.com/KangriCarrier) person who is called the ""Book Baba""  in J&amp;K. He is a mainland Indian who tries to procure / purchase books for J&amp;K students who either cannot afford them or don't have a way to purchase them. He provides a Google form which they can fill with their address and details and he sends them these books free. I think it is a great way to reach out to people of the valley and you can see the effect it has on students studying there by going through his feed.

Wanted to open a discussion on other ideas like this we can come up with to help them out in a way that helps them see actual change and brings some positivity into their lives.

Now hear me out. The reasons for the low number are plenty but one of them is so silly and stupid. Lack of toilets at work place. 

If you look at the road side shops/garbages/trade centres none of them have any toilets. There’s only men working there and when the nature calls you can see them looking for corners where they stand and deliver. Now women obviously can’t do that. If there is a toilet at the workplace more women can start working. And these small establishments won’t spend 50-60k on making a small toilet but it is necessary. 

The obvious solution is government tell these shops either make a toilet or shut shop - No licence till they have a toilet. In India even these big shops e.g. Sweet shops where you have 5-10 people working don’t have toilets. It’s actually embarrassing. If we make toilets in these establishments compulsory, our markets won’t stink of piss and you will find more women working. It’s a win-win situation at the expense of one time cost.",cog4xj,,false,/r/india/comments/cog4xj/about_the_lack_of_women_in_working_indian/,Non-Political

A close friend of mine comes from a conservative family in Bihar. She wants to study further but her parents are adamant on wanting her to stay at home and get married in an year or two. She wants to get her Masters, have a career, travel and live life on her terms. She's tried talking, explaining, even begging her family for support to study further, without any success. So now she sees no choice but to take matters into her own hands and run away and cut ties to her family completely.

She is financially sound and can take care of herself. What she's most afraid of is her parents filing a missing person's report in police station and the police somehow tracking her down. How can we avoid that? Is that even legal? She's an adult and not a minor and will be leaving a letter behind stating that she's leaving of her own will. 

Got any ideas for her to stay safe and follow through on her dreams? Any advice and ideas would be appreciated.",cogm42,,false,/r/india/comments/cogm42/19yearold_daughter_requires_your_urgent_help/,Non-Political

In the flight detail section, it said that Air Asia has [7kg cabin allowance and 0 kg check-in allowance.](https://imgur.com/a/VOLQgVt)

I checked for the same on MMT and it said it has 7kg cabin allowance and 15 kg check-in allowance.

To reassure myself I checked the official Air Asia site and it also said [7kg cabin allowance and 15 kg check-in allowance.](https://imgur.com/a/XTBKOin)

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone here have any recent experience with Air Asia domestic flight which can confirm the facts about luggage allowance limit?

Thanks in advance

UPDATE: I just contacted the customer support of AirAsia. They said the details on IRCTC are wrong. They do allow 15 kg check-in + 7 kg cabin baggage.",cwumxm,,false,/r/india/comments/cwumxm/some_confusion_regarding_air_travel/,Non-Political

Pointlessness of Kurushetra War.,"I considered Mahabharata a very consistent story until I realised a massive mistake from which the major character start acting out of their own character.

The whole Kurushetra War would play out as it did IF Krishna never broke any of his Vows. But he did!

https://i.redd.it/k89x3mrxvaj31.png

He broke his vow in front of everyone! Bhishma, Drona, Karna and many more where fighting for Duryodhana but they really did not want to. They were bound by conflicting vows, debt, honour etc. But they also identified Krishna as Supreme God!

So seeing Supreme God Himself break his vow in the time of crisis, would have relieved them of their clashing vows! Bhishma, Drona, Karna, Shalya etc. would have immediately abandoned Duryodhana and would join Pandavas or at least go Neutral like Balarama!  Because that's what their character would do! They are wise and  educated, They knew they were fighting for Adharma, and NOW it is completely okay to break the stupid vows. Duryodhana would loose all his Big Players and 99% of his army as they were following legends like Bhishma and Drona . Karna, would reveal his identity even though he was not an eyewitness to the incident he would believe the credible second hand accounts. The WAR WOULD BE OVER.

It was completely out of their character to keep on fighting as if nothing happened! YES! they were flawed but so were Pandavas and their allies! Shikhandi and Dhristadyumna's destiny can play out in different, completely non destructive way. And so could Karna's curses!",cwv9c3,,false,/r/india/comments/cwv9c3/mahabharata_massive_plothole_character/,Non-Political

 So this Janmashtami I saw this heart-warming scene.

A small dahi-handi was being broken by a mixed group of young boys and girls.

The girls didn't have to worry that the guys will be continuously looking for a chance to grope them.

They didn't have to worry that just because they are ok with guys touching them to help them climb and stay in place they are going to be judged as being ""open to be touched"".

They didn't have to worry that just because their tops might be a bit out of place every now and then, they are going to be slut-shamed and be judged as ""available"".

And since it was such a healthy atmosphere the girls were wholeheartedly participating and enjoying themselves as equals.

Definitely at least some green shoots of society maturing and there being real, healthy, open and equal interaction between the sexes leading to mutual fun and happiness.",cx0opa,,false,/r/india/comments/cx0opa/something_to_warm_the_heart/,Non-Political

Though I did work with his managers. Names are removed to protect identity.

Dear Co-Workers and Managers,

As many of you probably know, today is my last day. But before I leave, I wanted to take this opportunity to let you know what a great and distinct pleasure it has been to type “Today is my last day.”

For nearly as long as I’ve worked here, I’ve hoped that I might one day leave this company. And now that this dream has become a reality, please know that I could not have reached this goal without your unending lack of support. Words cannot express my gratitude for the words of gratitude you did not express.

I would especially like to thank all of my manager with the exception of the wonderful Mr. (Direct Manager), in an age where miscommunication is all too common, you consistently impressed and inspired me with the sheer magnitude of your misinformation, ignorance and intolerance for true talent. It takes a strong man to admit his mistake – it takes a stronger man to attribute his mistake to me.....

Over  the 10 months , you have taught me more than I could ever ask for and, in most cases, ever did ask for. I have been fortunate enough to work with some absolutely interchangeable supervisors on a wide variety of seemingly identical projects – an invaluable lesson in overcoming daily tedium in overcoming daily tedium in overcoming daily tedium

And to most of my peers: even though we barely acknowledged each other within these office walls, I hope that in the future, should we pass on the street, you will regard me the same way as I regard you: sans eye contact.

But to those few souls with whom I’ve actually interacted, here are my personalized notes of farewell:

To (Senior general manager) Sir , well, I wish you had more of a back bone. You threw me to the wolves with that witch B and I learned all too much from it. I still can’t believe that after following your instructions, I ended up getting written up, wow. Thanks for the experience sir, lesson learned.

To all of the executives of this company, Despite working through countless managers that practiced unethical behavior, racism, jealousy and cronyism, I have benefited tremendously by working here and I truly thank you for that. There was once a time where hard work was rewarded and acknowledged, it’s a pity that all of our positive output now falls on deaf ears and passes blind eyes. My advice for you is to place yourself closer to the pulse of this company and enjoy the effort and dedication of us “faceless little people” more. There are many great people that are being over worked and mistreated but yet are still loyal not to those who abuse them but to the greater mission of providing excellent customer support. Find them and embrace them as they will help battle the cancerous plague that is ravishing the moral of this company.

We don't love the art, we love the artist.","Amitabh is a great artist! He can talk for hours about acting. But why should his comment on cricket commentatory make Harsha Bhogle lose his job?

Shahrukh is a great actor as well. Ask all about his acting techniques. Why do you want to know what he smells like?

Why does PC being a hyprocrite with respect to smoking and diwali matter?

Why does Silpa being a hypocrite with respect to meat and animal cruelty matter?

Why does Virat's girlfriend list matter?

Why should Dhoni advertise Kabaddi?

Why should Sachin's son make news?

When you begin to like the person before art, we tend to adore and blindly follow everything he does. Can't we separate art from the artist? This too is specific to only movies and cricket. You don't stalk A. R. Rahman and ask for his opinion on Diwali issue but why do you care about PC's?

Our inspirations are screwed up as well. Most of us didn't hear about Sonam Wangchuk before 3 idiots. We don't know CNR Rao. We don't know Kailash Satyarthi. Scientists are so unknown in our country. Look at the other nations, Brian Greene, Bill Nye, ND Tyson, Richard Dawkins and many more scientists are so revered and they do a great job in making public rational. We don't hear about Indian scientists, we don't have kids aspiring to be researchers mainly because we are too busy with our actors and cricketers.

I recently started watching an Indian TV Drama known as ''Chakravartin Ashoka Samrat'' and I want to talk about it with someone.,"I've recently started watching the series thanks to Opera's built-in VPN. Whenever I watch any TV series I like to talk to people about it but no one in the USA knows what this series is so I'm posting this here in an effort to start a discussion with people of the original and intended audience. What are your likes and dislikes about the series etc ?I know the series is a soap opera but it's wise to remember that all soap operas are diverse in quality. American Soap Operas for example are known for largely focusing on family drama, Mexican soap operas are known for focusing on romance and batshit crazy, knife-wielding abuelitas. Meanwhile Indian Soap Operas appear to be largely historical in nature and all of these genres have differences between each other depending on who made them and how.

**Things I love about the series**

1. Historical dramas are nice and actually help teach the audience or get them interested in the real story
2. Casting is great, Siddharth Nigam is not only a perfect specimen of a human being but also identical to the real Ashoka.
3. Music is great
4. Set design is great
5. Acting is great

**Things I don't like.**

1. Early into the series, it seems that it attempted to deliberately rip off Game of Thrones by including a Khal Drogo esque character ( who's name I can't remember ) Helena is very similar to Cersei Lannister as well.
2. There are repetitive plots and Ashoka seems to have a prison fetish considering that he gets locked away, beaten and wiped in a suspiciously sexual manner and nearly executed for some crime that Sushim was probably behind every 15 episodes before being found innocent. So Either Ashoka enjoys being a prisoner or Bindusaras soldiers just practice unintentional fetish material, i'm not judging anyones sexual preferences but it's a bit annoying.
3. Bindusara is a fucking idiot who couldn't see the truth if it slapped him in the face. He is probably one of the unintentionally worst kings in fiction, rivaled by King Regis XV in Final Fantasy 15. 
4. The show has very high reviews and it appears that most indian critics view this show as superior to most soap operas despite the fact that it contains the same stuff as any other indian soap opera. 

Edit\*

Yeah I know my dislikes are viewed as pointless but let's focus on the positives of this episode people, id like for a good discussion about this show's positives not it's repetitive faults.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I learned something interesting about this show. Apparently Siddharth Nigam didn't know who or what Ashoka was before landing the role as the young ruler and had to do an extreme amount of studying before-hand. Older Indian people attacked Siddharth for not knowing this ''crucial'' part of Indian history and tended to express the whole ''hurr durr milennials stoopid'' attitude because of this. In the meanwhile every woman in India and probably some gay boi's too were too busy swooning over his body.",coxkim,,false,/r/india/comments/coxkim/im_an_american_i_recently_started_watching_an/,Non-Political

Yes dad, I understand you have experience in life and I am a naive idiot like you say. But I am going to call you out for being an asshole. If you think I am disrespecting you then I can only assume that you are a fool and become feeble with old age and I might start to think dementia has started. Just because you are old doesn't mean you get to talk shit about people behind their backs. Yes I understand you struggled hard in your youth and people stabbed you in the back and you had no meal for 5 days continuously, still doesn't excuse you being annoying now.

And Yes, I am grateful to you for providing me with a home and all the other things. But I didn't know any better when I was born that you would be the kind of person to play the gratitude card. You kind of decided to have a child and now it only feels like you are complaining that I am ungrateful. I accept that I am a bit of an ass, after all, I am YOUR child.

Showing gratitude is not the same as staying silent when you traumatize me with your shitty behavior. I am human too.

And you assume that I can't survive without you. Honestly I think that you should have kicked me out. Sure I would be homeless or living in a closet somewhere, at least I wouldn't have developed PTSD from listening to you going on and on about your past.

\*\*Rant Over\*\*

Edit: I don't totally hate him because:  


Mine's (My dad is) somewhat justified in that people around him asked him to be a good guy all the while making it impossible. My Mom brought financial ruin, parents didn't support him; (his parents, my grandparents) had 5 children and didn't have enough money to give him college education. The siblings had their own life to worry about (Ungrateful because some of them were doing better and could have helped.) and when it came time to support my father when I was born, there was no one. He practically was the bread winner for 5 people. I feel like he thinks I am also being ungrateful like the rest of them, which I think is a justified fear. But acting like an ass for something trivial doesn't exactly remedy the past. I am really not sure how to fix this. I don't think I can.. he seems broken beyond repair..",coyb2f,,false,/r/india/comments/coyb2f/anyone_think_that_dads_of_india_can_just_turn/,Non-Political

Being an atheist, I try to keep my nose out of anything related to God, irrespective of the religion, since I dont think I have a right to comment about something that I dont have the mental capacity to understand. Also, apologies for the long rant, but I had to vent off.

About an hour ago, my best friend, his wife, his son and I were traveling from Delhi to our home town. 1 part of the road had already been blocked for the Kaanwars procession, and so the other half was laboring along in traffic. My friend's son and I were in the back seat and had dozed off. All of a sudden, my head rammed into the front seat due to emergency break being applied as one of the Kaanwars had crossed into our lane and my friend had tried to avoid it.

Almost immediately, the 2 guys on the bike started shouting at us with expletives asking us if we were blind. It became apparent that they were drunk with their slurred voices and inebriated behavior. Knowing the pack mentality, and the fact that we had a female and a kid in the car, both of us tried to be as polite as possible and tried to cool them off. 

Things turned worse as a few other Kaanwars joined them as their DJ procession was pretty close. While a few others on the side started making videos and hooting, the passersby just stood and watched. Thankfully, there were a couple of older Kaanwars in the group who kept on trying to calm everything down and within a couple of minutes, the police arrived on the scene and we were asked to go after issuing an apology for bad driving and bad behavior towards the Holy Kaanwars. Surrounded by thugs, and those who are being paid by the government to support them, and fearful for our lives, we did.

I am not sure what is becoming of this country anymore and what's the endgame here. Sorry once again for the long rant.",coyp6x,,false,/r/india/comments/coyp6x/the_kaawariyas_have_become_a_group_of_thugs/,Non-Political

As per labor law, breaks are mandatory after 4 hours, which entitles us to two breaks of 1 hours per night shift. Overtime is fixed for 11 hour shift and not paid as per hours of overitme calculated which is stated in labor laws.

So after reading all the comments, I decided to sit down with my parents and confront them that what they're doing is wrong and told them they had to trust me and would never do anything wrong and embarrass them. We had a great conversation for about 2/3 hours. I even showed them some of the comments. They realized what they were doing is wrong and even apologised for what they've done! Honestly, I don't blame them for what they've done.

Bobs vagana and the like. Is it really that bad though? 


Where do you guys run into losers like that? I spent a lot of time on Yahoo messenger between 13 and 16 (2002 to 2005) talking in bad English to mostly Americans. Never had one person mock me for being an Indian. And I made plenty of friends online in other platforms until 2010 and still faced no issues. I haven't chatted much since then because I'm busy and also there's no real good site to meet new people. So I can't talk about how it is now. But still, I've carried on using the internet a lot and have been using reddit for at least five years. I do feel the issue is somewhat overblown by some Indians. I don't know what the majority think at r/India though.

The only place where you're sure to come across dumb statements are on comment sections in places like r/space. It just doesn't have a sting when it's a comment not said to me directly. Why care about what some rando said in some comment section. You'll always find such things online.

It doesn’t matter if its Hindu King, who wasn’t elected into power, signed the state over to India.

The muslim PEOPLE of Kashmir DO NOT and NEVER HAVE wanted to be part of India.

India is colonising Kashmir the same away the British Colonial Government had once enslaved India for centuries. India has become its own worst nightmare.

“We are protecting you from indignity.” said the Europeans while enslaving the Africans.

“We are protecting you from hunger.” said the French while starving the Vietnamese.

“We are protecting you from terrorism.” said the Indians while terrorising the Kashmiris.

Communication down. Hospitals, schools, and markets CLOSED. State leaders under house arrest. This is what the Kurdish people of Northern Syria experienced when ISIS rolled over into their towns with their guns.

All of this transpiring around the holy occasion of Eid. This shows just how “concerned” India is about the welfare of the Kashmiri muslims. Imagine India under siege during Diwali.

India has become a tyrannical regime.  


**EDIT**: For the dim in need of clarification as if it wasn't deafeningly obvious already: I'm for Kashimir's independence from India, Pakistan, and any other foreign element. Kashmir only belongs to the Kashmiris. To deny their right is to commit an **unforgivable** war crime. Kashmir's fate post its independence shouldn't be anyone's concern but of the Kashmiris.

You do realise we as Indians have allowed rapists and mass murders to control our politics right? Considering we, a nation much stronger, richer and prosperous than theirs can allow such a things to happen what exactly are we expecting from a country with people way worse of and powerless against its elite than us ? If we are so much nicer maybe give them a hand innit and be the bigger person.

Or maybe realise we are literally no better and as powerless against the politicians and the elite as our siblings across the border.

We speak of their politicians and how they spew lies and deceive, while our own politicians and elite deceive and lie on a daily basis to it's own citizens, from local mlas all the way to pm and his office. Maybe focus our energies on cleaning our own house first before we decide to go around cleaning up the neighbourhood.

Please let's just remember that they are also human beings and are dealing with condition way worse than what we have here and it's not look things here are amazing or something so we can only imagine how they have to live.

I reached out to their customer care but have not heard back yet. Do others see this in their bills too?

This got me curious so I decided to run some numbers:
I took the monthly numbers from [this ET article](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/newsbuzz/zomato-claims-to-have-hit-market-leadership-with-21-million-monthly-order-run-rate/articleshow/66090080.cms)
&gt; “At the beginning of 2018, we were at 3.5 million orders a month. With 21 million orders per month, as far as we know, we are now the market leader in the food ordering space in India,” wrote Zomato CEO, Deepinder Goyal in a blog post on Friday. 
&gt; Industry sources however peg Zomato’s absolute order volumes at over 14 million as of September. Swiggy clocks over 20 million monthly orders in absolute terms as of September, the persons cited above said. 

and kept the round off fee as INR 0.3 (half of what I was charged).

If they continue to ""round off"" every order (big assumption, which is why am curious to see if others are also charged today), they do seem to make quite a lot of money (INR 42 lacs per month, base case)

https://i.imgur.com/bstIRED.png

I might be overreacting and should probably wait for them to clarify this amount. What do you guys think?

But my bill suddenly shot up to 1k-ish per month for 2-3 months. 

Since I had also made some international calls in that period, I decided to ignore the breakup thinking it was charges from those calls.

But turns out, that these sneaky people enabled value added services without my consent. Something called ""All Channels Vodafone TV Weekly Pack"" and something else called ""Re.1 Store""

On my 1st attempt at talking to customer care to resolve this, the guy on the other end of the line tells me he cannot check my bill breakdown because his server is down, please call tomorrow. 

On my 2nd attempt, one day later, I decided to chat with a customer agent via the website, this bloke tells me I apparently opened Vodafone play app, requested an OTP and activated the paid service for Vodafone TV myself - blatant lie, to my face!

Also he refuses to tell me what Re. 1 Store charge (of Rs.99 + Tax) is for. He then says it is a 3rd party value added service. Vodafone has nothing to do with it. Never-mind I tell him I need the services deactivated, he takes a request, I get a message. Two weeks go by, nothing happens.

On my 3rd attempt to fix things, I called them again today and got the services finally deactivated (I think?!).

When I asked the customer care lady what was Re.1 store she repeated the same crap. She doesn't know what it is. And that it's a 3rd party service that customer has activated. 

When I googled it I found this link [https://discover.vodafone.in/documents/pdfs/re1store\_faqs.pdf](https://discover.vodafone.in/documents/pdfs/re1store_faqs.pdf)

It is basically some fuckhole list of Wallpapers, Animations, Themes, Tones, Games and Videos that I can download for Rs. 5 a day. Of course I definitely activated must have activated this - because why not, right?

Basically Vodafone is activating some scam services in an unsolicited manner for its long term, loyal, unsuspecting customers.

I'm so appalled right now. 

And its not for 500 bucks extra a month, but for the lies and deceit I had to face.

Why on earth will I activate Vodafone TV when I have DTH and host of on-demand services on my laptop.

TLDR - Check your monthly bill breakups people. The slowdown in economy is making even the good companies turn to unethical practices.",ctunu3,,false,/r/india/comments/ctunu3/vodafone_is_sneakily_activating_value_added/,Non-Political

When she told me about the incident, I felt so bad that I don't even have a word to describe it. That situation badly affected her mental health and she questioned me what could she have done to stop what happened with her? What if it happens again? And even, should women carry guns?(she is not a violent person, it was just her angst and fear talking) 

I googled about this groping in public thing and turns out that it is very common in India, and some other countries too! But my google searches did not yield me any helpful information about this social issue that almost every woman in our country faces. So I'm here to ask those questions.

1. How can a woman prevent and defend this? What precautions should she take? 

2. What should she do right away as well as after this happens? 

3. Best self defence methods in these situations? (Like pepper spray)

4. Any group or commission that help in such cases? 

5. How does our police act on cases like this?

Now, detail post below. 


My mother is really toxic person. She fights /has arguments with my father , MIL n FIL  of mother, all neighbors everytime whenever we move to different place. We used to live on rented flat untill we bought small low key house.

She always wanted our own house. She used to say she doesn't like to live in rented house. For that she uses to quarrel with my father every night. I mean fucking every night. My father is such kind soul. She used to scream on him. On neighbors. She has habit of screaming.

Now i am perusing my engineering in other city (i am 25M). I get dreams to my mother screaming at my father.   It really horrifies me. I told her multiple i fking hate she screams whenevi come home and she screams at people. 


For example : We have flower plant in our front yard, now some colony people sometimes comes n pluck flowers for Pooja arti of whatever their reason without asking. My. Mother literally screams at them. 


Other day, i came home for week, Cat come and inserted her mouth in milk can. My mother started shouting on my father. Saying it's happened because of you. My father doesn't make that cat go away forcefully like my mother. This is just example. 

I am unable to concentrate on my studies even when i am away from home . Her screaming sounds is in  my head. I picture herself quarreling with my father in my head. Sometimes i think, it would have been better had i been anath (parent less). It just small issue which annoys me like hell.  I

I have grown up all my childhood, where my mother keep screaming at someone for something.. Quarreling with someone. Please help. Is this normal?

Below is a very interesting insight :
 
Often heard nowadays that "" _indian Economy is struggling_ "". 

Sit back &amp; dispassionately think ""is the economy really struggling *or*  are business models struggling ?

Some food for thought:

1) Car sales are going down... *but Ola / Uber are rising.*

2)  Restaurants are going empty... *but home delivery is rising*

3) Tuition classes are not getting students *but online studying is rising*
4) Traders are struggling *but online market sites and reference based direct selling are breaking all records in sales.*

6) Cell phone bills have reduced &amp; *internet penetration is increasing.*

7) Stable (read ""Govt Jobs"") are dwindling *but ""Start up"" jobs offering equity &amp; Flexi work time are expanding.*

8) Jobs seekers are reducing but *job creaters are on the rise*.
Working 40 hrs a week for 40 years is trend of past. *Working for few years and spending quality time in contributing to society is the trend..* 

The bitter truth is what we are experiencing is a transition phase
&amp; Any transition is painful for the ""well set""...
""The masters of the past"". 

*_It's challenging for those who's business models are based on ancient data...._*

*_Sunil Gavaskar style 35 not out cannot win one day matches today._*
*_We need a Rohit/Virat style today._*

It's a mystery for those who have never looked beyond traditional methods or have assiduously resisted change of any kind.

Economy is not struggling...

They seem pretty confusing with their new ""IIITD Rank"". 

https://www.collegepravesh.com/cutoff/iiit-delhi-cutoff-2019/

The ranks seem to be fluctuating wierdly between different rounds too! (look at CSAI JEE Mains rank in Round 3 and Round 4) And they have taken people for CSE who've got 28K rank in JEE Mains (this was around 5K last year ig). 

So, I can deduce that they calculate their ""IIITD Rank"" using their [Bonus Points system](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/sites/default/files/docs/admissions/2019/BTech-Admission-Brochure2019.pdf) (in which you get bonus points for getting exceptional in boards, olympialds, sports etc).

They've mentioned that they give bonus points ranging from 1-11 but they haven't revealed what's the weightage of bonus points with respect to the JEE Mains rank. 

Can anyone explain how do they actually weight the JEE Mains score and the bonus points in determining the ""IIITD Rank"". And what would be a good score in boards and good rank in JEE Mains to be safe for IIITD CSE/ECE?

1566724972,loneguy_,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cv6fqo/urban_ladder_pepperfry_hometown_rentickle/,30,63,,,"Urban Ladder, Pepperfry, Hometown, Rentickle, Rentomojo Review","Hi all,

Just leaving my few cents on experience with the following online furniture retailers. 

Now After struggling to rent a half-decent 1BHK which did not cost 17-18k. I go to step 2 that is either buy or rent some furniture. When I checked out Rentickle or Rentomojo for 1 year the EMI was high high and well the cost of mattress+bed rent for 1 year would be 9k (rent per month will Rs 800 per month), not exactly queen size but well a big bed and then renting study table, chair another Rs 600-700 per month for a year.

Now for what reason the WTF light lit up in my brain and I decided buying this makes more sense I don't know.  Anyhow, I got to a few furniture shops everyone is like Teak, Neem, Mahogany wood beds. Now in the local shops, the beds did look sturdy a single bed costs around 7k without the plank/plywood for the mattress support but they felt heavy, had super rough/sharp edges, you will cut your fingers or have small skin tears when you make your bed(fix the bedsheet etc) or put the mattress for sure. Not an expert but they felt like are made of engineered wood(Not saying that's bad). They looked sturdy but didn't feel like buying as they looked cheap + rough sharp edges + shopkeepers bullshitting about using Neem/Teak/Mahogany I just didn't feel like buying.

Now I decided to give the online markets a try 

Here Goes....

Urban Ladder: I bought a single bed from here costed 11k it can support a mattress of max 78x36x5 (inches). The bed looks good is super lightweight, they didn't claim to use Teak or something, they said Rubberwood/Malaysia Rubberwood. Now I am aware most cheap furniture use this wood but I decided to go ahead and buy. The bed came with slats no need for plywood support for mattress. The bed is super light look good no sharp edges BUT and this is a huge BUT

I am not sure how sturdy the stuff is.. I did stand it on it post-delivery(am 84kgs), but frankly slats instead of plank/plywood was a fucked-up idea.... my rationale was when I move to a different place packing will be easier but I am regretting that decision. The bed itself seems fine as in the legs the support etc but the slats seem like the weakest link... 

For the price, I paid I was expecting something more sturdy than what I got.....

Warranty is for 1 Year

Hometown: I ordered a simple study table they sent the wrong product, the delivery date was postponed by a week...

Now coming to the table itself Its engineered wood seems to be sturdy but the edges are super sharp. The cost was OKAY, as in you can get a slightly bigger table from one of the DIY brands available on amazon but if you want someone else to do the job for you :P, Now coming to the whole experience it has been very poor... the customer care is very responsive and always answers the call but wrong product delivery + long long process for refund has frustrated me.

Pepper Fry: Cheap furniture, I saw a few sofas that I saw at local shops but they were cheaper by 1k and the wood used is engineered wood.  No claims of Teak or Mahogany bla bla....

Now for the price the furniture is fine. They always have some sale. If you buy from pepperfry please use the offer code applicable for that period as they don't auto-apply offer codes during bill checkout but show the discounted price on the product page. 

Pepperfry and Urban Ladder don't allow writing reviews. Hometown does....

&amp;#x200B;

Rentickle: I initially booked washing machine bed and other stuff via them but they declined my request as my Account was not a Salaried one and my Offer Letter was not sufficient for proof of employment...... (one fo the reasons I hit fuck it and bought most of the furniture)

So I requested to cancel the order. 1 week passes by no refund. I went nuts contacted them they said the order has not been cancelled  :| Gave them a dose they cancelled the order and after a week got the refund.

My friend also had a shitty experience, it took 3 weeks for delivery and mattress was not that great as well. Please do note if you live at 2nd floor or higher and lift facility is currently not available in your building you need to pay extra this is part of Rentickle policy many ppl fail to read this point.

You have to pay Rs 50-100 for taking the item upstairs to your room.

Rentomojo: Good experience. Rented an Automatic Top loading washing machine, delivered in 1 week no extra charge for delivering it even if the building has no lift service. The machine I received was brand new, from Haier works like a charm. The only downside was if the length of the inlet pipe is less/not sufficient than you have to buy a longer one Rentomojo will not provide anything other what you get with washing machine out of the box, but if you do buy a longer one the Rentomojo guy will install without any issues.

Note:

Writing this review if someone is wondering about the quality at any of these websites. Hope it helps. People who buy stuff online, please write reviews even if the site does not allow use someplace like mouthshut or reddit to leave reviews so that ppl can decide whether to proceed or not.

A review can help a great deal for some reason most ppl leave reviews when product is shitty or when paid to I rarely see the product fine/decent reviews for certain items. Ratings don't tell the full story but a few words can shed more light on stuff....

EDIT:

Anyone who purchased from Neelkamal, Usha or some of the known branded retailers

In my home, i feel no sense of privacy. My parents check all my text messages, gallery etc. The worse is that they don't do it daily (If it was daily, i would probably delete them everyday). Some random day, i get my phone snatched off me and they unlock it (they know my password), read my whatsapp texts (especially with girls), my IG and even my gallery. They once scolded me for using the F word with a girl. I tried explaining them the context (that i said it sarcastically like ""ohh fuckk"") but they're like ""You wanna make her pregnant or what? you scoundrel"" (yes,that happened) and the worse is they looking at my gallery with all my selfies with other girls too (they're my best friends). They just can't understand the fact that a guy and girl can be Friends without anything between them. It's been going on since a year and I never opened up about it because the abuse was usually emotional with shoutings, being grounded etc but today, i got beaten by my dad because I was talking to a girl at 11 night which is ""BAD"" and ""UNCULTURED"". That's the reason i opened up (at least on the internet cause IRL friends suck).

Most of the times they either cancel the trip 10 mins after they accepted it or they just keep wasting their own and my time by taking a very long time to cover very small distances to my pickup spot. 

I cant say the same about the other kinds of cabs because (1) I havent experienced this as much with them and (2) I mainly use Uber Go or Uber Auto and I have no complaints with the former.

Just now I booked an Auto and luckily he was just 1 min away from my pickup spot. After 10 mins of waiting I decided to walk over to where he is and lo and behold, the guy is sitting in his vehicle just seeing some movie, not at all bothered that he has someone to pick up and drop. 

When questioned he gave the excuse that ""Bhaiya ye savariya tang kardeti hai. Jab tak call na kare vo tab tak mai ata nahi hu. Pahuchta hu to hote nahi log pickup spot pe. Faltu me CNG nahi phookana"". I was literally 1 min away from him, even the app shows that, just how much CNG could he have wasted if he had come?

Before people say 'this guy again', yes, this is how I will need to keep talking unless things change. Its a dirty free for all the way Indians behave. The general masses have no standards, and when things are introduced with some standards (on-demand cabs, food aggregators, online shopping aggregators, and in this case classifieds websites) they shit all over them.

My issue with the websites is that 'dog' category has cats, 'cat' category has dogs, 'small animals' category has mostly dogs, and people abuse the word 'adoption' because it catches attention. Most breeders selling their pets are using the word adoption in the title which, anywhere else in the world, means rehoming or giving away pets for free/very low cost. Even called one of these fellows and he said sternly 'it is for sale not for adoption'. I asked him why his title said adoption, and he says 'adoption is the word for selling, if its being given away the title will say 'give away'. Not only did he contradict himself by saying 'not for adoption' when i inquired using the word within the first 10 seconds of the call, anybody in their right mind will not title it 'give away' they will say adoption.

But with that plan I barely for 4-5 mbps on good times. Both the test were made at the same place and around same time, midnight.

Sorry for the long post. TLDR in the end. 

I came across a new advertisement by Netflix India titled '[Pappu Pakitmaar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_350KdC5P8c)'. If you notice, in the second half of the advertisement, the pickpocketer Pappu gets beaten by a mob of people, apparently for pickpocketing / attempting to do so. There have been A LOT OF incidents in which people have been beaten to death by mobs on suspicions of theft or any other suspicions. While I am aware of similar ""mob lynchings"" for communal reasons, I am not mentioning those instances here. Some of the very recent reports I found online are below:

**August 05, Mumbai: Mistaken for a thief, 47-year old was beaten to death.** [Source](https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/mumbai/crime/mistaken-for-a-thief-47-year-old-beaten-to-death-in-kalyan-market/articleshow/70561561.cms)

**August 03, Patna: Child-lifting rumours trigger mob attacks, 2 men beaten to death in separate incidents.** [Source](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/two-lynched-three-injured-on-child-lifting-rumour-in-patna/articleshow/70525736.cms)

**August 02, Rajasthan: Man Lynched in Rajasthan Over Bike Theft.** [Source](https://www.thequint.com/news/india/india-latest-crime-news-6-august-2019)

**August 01, Jharkhand: A burglar was beaten to death, taking number of mob-lynchings to five deaths in less than a month in the state.** [Source](https://www.dailypioneer.com/2019/state-editions/burglar-beaten-to-death-in-dumka--j---khand-lynching-toll-touches-five-in-one-month.html)

**July 27, Kolkata: A snatcher was beaten to death.** [Source](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/snatcher-beaten-to-death-in-nadia/articleshow/70425298.cms)

**July 26, New Delhi: A 16-year old boy was beaten to death for stealing.** [Source](https://www.indiatoday.in/crime/story/16-year-old-boy-beaten-to-death-for-stealing-in-delhi-1574095-2019-07-27)

In the light of such horrifying events, this advertisement by Netflix India appropriates the public beating the pickpocketer. The character says, *""Lekin ek din jab maar pada na, tab dimaag ka batti jala.""* translated as, *""But then one day I got smacked, and then it struck me.""* It further goes on to show the character being beaten by a mob who is chasing him angrily, but do not report it to the Police, even afterwards. He further says, *""That was the day I stopped picking pockets and started this new business""* which is a second hand goods shop. 

The advertisement clearly justifies and appropriates the idea of ""mob justice"" in which anyone who is a thief, or is suspected of committing theft, is beaten by the public. This has led to several innocent men being lynched for no fault of their own. Even if they have committed theft, the ideal step should be to inform the police and hand him over for further investigation, rather than taking law in one's own hands. Restraining such person with force, as may be necessary, is another matter but beating till such person loses consciousness, or worse, is dead, is a criminal offence. Netflix India cannot appropriate or justify or promote something that, in the name of mob justice, 'teaches a lesson' to such person. 

I might be reading a bit too much into it, but this is really concerning, especially considering the increasing number of mob lynchings in India. Please let me know what you think of it.

It's only upto us to grasp it and make assumptions from what we know about his line of work but it's very hard to know. He runs his own thing. It's not a business but sort of self employed. 

He's  almost never provided my mom with household expenses only to leave her to spend from her own. She is a teacher and while she earns an average salary, she always runs out of it at the end of the month.

He has lied throughout his life that he doesn't have money whenever mom asks for help or anything but he's always driven a good car and has a good office. 

Despite all this, he says that he doesn't have much left at the end of the month after paying off his staff and office expenses.

He plays electricity, telephone bills, school/college fees of his children (which also mom contributed to)

Is it fair for a man to have this much power even though he's the dominant earner in the family?

My mom's a very simple person who's never asked for anything for herself. The exact opposite of a gold digger  Whether it's scorching heat, extreme cold or rainfall, she's travelled her entire life on her two wheeler while my dad hasn't been without a good car in years. He does care for his children though (I've a spare car since two years which he lets me use once or twice a week).",cn9psq,,false,/r/india/comments/cn9psq/is_it_fair_for_a_man_to_keep_his_wealth_and/,Non-Political

1565742653,Switchroo,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cq21z4/rant_pathetic_after_sales_support_by/,5,2,,,[Rant] Pathetic after sales support by flipkart/jeeves,"I ordered VU 65"" television on Thursday 8th August. Order Id: OD11\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*. The order was delivered the very next day. Great job. Then the installation was promised by Saturday 10th August.

I contacted flipkart customer care, 1800 208 9898, on 10th August 12:59 PM, to inform them about the updated number the installation guys should contact me on. The guy said me to wait till evening, the appointment has been booked at 6 pm and then contact again tomorrow if no one shows up. I sure waited till evening postponing my plans to see if anyone comes home to install the TV. But sure enough no body shows up.

I then get the call from Flipkart by number +91 8\*\*\*\* \*\*\*\*0 at 1:08 PM on 11th August. He said to me that he has placed a request for address change (cause he can not just change phone number, he has to request address change to change the phone number) and promised me that the installation will be done by 12th August. I waited at my home for installation guys to come home whole day on 12th August. NOBODY SHOWS UP. No call even on my updated number.

Now already loosing my patience, I call Flipkart customer care on 1800 208 9898 at 9:45 AM 13th August. She was not helpful at all. She said she was sorry and she is raising complaint and said that it will be resolved by 16th August. Furious, I denied to wait till then and wanted to get in contact with someone local. She denied that she can not give any number. However she did give me jeeves customer service number 1800 4252 365 365. I called jeeves number but it was not helpful at all as it was phone mobile phones.

I then looked up flipkart jeeves online and got the number 1800 4252 5252. I spoke to a lady and she said that the system says the customer is not ready. Surprised I asked why would it say that. I was ready waiting for the installation whole day yesterday and no body showed up. She also said that my new updated number is in the system and she is escalating the issue. And promised me that the installation will be done today by 7 pm. And technician will contact me within 3 hours.

I get the call from kunal from flipkart (not the technician) at 13th August 12:19PM to let me know that the installation will be done today by 7 pm.

I waited till more than 3 hours but didn't receive any call from technician. So I again call 1800 4252 5252 at 4:54PM 13th August and spoke with lady. She informed me that the technician has been assigned and he will install it by today 7pm. And that I can contact him on +91 8\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*.  I hung up the phone and called him immediately at 5:00 pm 13th August. He mentioned that he tried calling me yesterday 12th August but didn't get answer so we don't come. It is their policy to not visit customer house if they don't receive phone call. And he continued that it is 5 pm which is late now and there is no person available to perform installation today. I said I was promised to have installation done today by flipkart. And he said he can not come.

I immediately call the 1800 4252 5252 number at 5:11. Spoke with guy and said that I have the technician number. I said i spoke to him and said he cant come. But I cant wait and has to have this installation done which was 3 days overdue. He said that he has escalated the issue and there will be an alternative technician allocated for installation. I should not worry and sure enough that the installation will be done today.

I waited an hour and call the 1800 4252 5252 at 6:17 to get update on installation and alternative technician person. The person repeated same tale and said that he has escalated the issue and the installation will be done by end of the day today.

Waited 45 minutes and called 1800 4252 5252 again at 7:04 pm and said it is past 7 pm and no body has showed up for installation. He said installation will be done by the end of the day. however is was already end of the day. He said he is escalating issue and I said the issue has been escalated twice and nothing has been done. He said that installation will be done today. However the technician is not responding. I asked if technician is not responding then how will the installation be done today. He then proceeds to tell me that he is escalating to branch manager. He spoke to branch manager and has given my details to him also told me that branch manager will be contacting me within 15 minutes.

I sure waited 20 minutes and no body calls me. I call 1800 4252 5252 number again and repeated my issue and said that I want installation done today. Now they are saying that the branch is closed and installation will be done tomorrow. Again false promise. I ask her to ask branch manager to call me. She agrees.

I waited, but no one called. My installation was not performed. All I was given was false hope. I had to postpone my plans for installation. Utter example of pathetic after sales support.",cq21z4,,false,/r/india/comments/cq21z4/rant_pathetic_after_sales_support_by/,Non-Political

I'm pursuing B.com and I'm very much interested in programming and want to learn it in my free time. 

 So I was in search of a mentor. And luckily found a nice one but when I asked him if he would help me with this then he told me that it's of no use unless you have a degree in that field. 
He suggested me that I should not learn programming and should focus on my studies only. This made me very sad and I'm losing interest eventually. 

Is this the reality of India? Do people with degrees actually succeed? Even if yes why the people discourage others who are interested?

1567250198,ppatra,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cxutt8/my_wonderful_journey_with_bsnl_is_coming_to_an/,19,6,,,My wonderful journey with BSNL is coming to an end and it's entirely on them.,"If you remember I shared [my experience of getting a BSNL broadband.]( https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/58lwlk/heres_my_experience_of_getting_a_new_bsnl_bb_ll/), it's going ti be 3 years in next few months.

The connection and service was really beyond my expectations. I hardly had any problems and if there was any after lodging a complaint exchange used to call within 1 hour and lineman was at my door within minutes. I also used to get unlimited 10Mbps downloads, unlimited calling on my plan of ₹499+tax from last year when they revised the plans. 

But recently the connection quality degraded, there was frequent disconnection and to BSNL's credit they came and changed cable, did something at the junction box multiple times. But nothing could fix the disconnection problem. I even went to exchange to test my modem and it was fine, no disconnection there. 

Few weeks ago (about one month I think) they came and did something again which fixed the disconnection problem to some extent but there was still disconnection. What was worrying is my connection speed dropped to 2Mbps and below. Guy said it's a server problem and will be fixed, if not fixed then they will come again. 

I know it wasn't a server problem and told the guy multiple times to check. He did nothing and left. 

After that I called exchange multiple times, lodged complaints but all were closed saying fault is fixed. The linemans didn't come either. The exchange used to call and ask if broadband working or not, then after listening my problem he used to cut the call and after few hours I used to ger sms that fault is fixed .

After repeated calls to exchange, lodging complaints from last week the exchange told that the linemans aren't coming to work because they aren't getting salary from six months, they will send someone whenever they come. I waited for few days and called again and again, same story.

Now today they came and was working at the junction box, to my surprise they left without visiting my home. I called exchange to know what's going on and he said they can't fix it, and it won't go up from 2Mbps I'm getting. He told me to talk with officer. 

I said there was something that guys done and probably an easy fix if they reverse what was done earlier. The exchange giy didn't listen to me and hung up on my face! 

That's it BSNL, I don't have enough time and the mental power to take it up with grievance officer. I have suffered enough in last few months and wasted my time. I absolutely loved my time with BSNL, it's the only stable broadband that was available in my area. I don't have Hathway, Act or anything. I even requested them to give fiber line and 1 month earlier seeing my problem they told me that they'll give fiber but even after 1 month nothing progressed. 

Even customer care is clueless lately.

Goodbye my BSNL connection, you will be missed but not that much considering what I had to face at the end. I won't be taking your Fiber connection either.

This entire post is coming  from a guy who was really proud of taking BSNL connection in this era, alas BSNL, you failed me.",cxutt8,,false,/r/india/comments/cxutt8/my_wonderful_journey_with_bsnl_is_coming_to_an/,Non-Political

I have seen many similar threads here.I am a non-IT, non-engineering,non-science graduate working as a software developer in a big company.(yep,service based).I was once where you are now.Please hear me out why building a career in an indian IT company while having a non-engg/sci degree may be harder than drinking water in a 9AM Mumbai local.

First ask yourself why do you want to join IT ?

1. Chances are you screwed up somewhere along the way and you see ""IT job"" as an easy way out. There are always more vacancies than most other fields  which are accessible to a bcom/ba grad.
2. You want to make a splash.Change the world with the next fb/wa/insta.
3. You've heard the saying ""If you give peanuts,you get monkeys"" right?. Well your current job gives you peanuts.Developers get paid well. You don't want to remain a monkey ,do you?

Why these reasons are BS:

1. Life ~~mostly~~always gives you second chances.A low score in graduation can be overcome.The type of IT companies which are accessible to you as a BA/BCOM fresher are managed by incompetent slave drivers. You don't want to be on the receiving end of their tear-stained whips.
2. As far as working in an average indian IT company and creating cutting-edge tech is concerned,You can expect to make as much noise as pissing on a wet blanket.
3. No,they don't . In fact a 12th pass working in an international call center gets more than entry-level developers.There are plenty jobless engineers in India.The only reason a company would hire you is because they can pay you less and use your degree as a justification.

What then?

1. Please do a PG degree.In a saturated market,what willl always stand out is a solid PG from a reputed institution.After this,you can work/think about govt exams etc.
2. If you are dead set on a tech career,please go abroad,they have relaxed ug  requirments.I wouldn't recommentd MCA,since many companies discriminate here too.Product companes require BE. Have a look at the hiring challenges on hackerrank/codechef or even naukri.99%+ of those jobs require relevant degree.
3. Service companies are not good pay-masters.See point 1 if money is your motivation.

&amp;#x200B;

Disclaimer: The above is for an average grad looking to move into IT. If you are an exceptionally talented developer,I would recommend freelancing .Hoping for someone to prove me wrong in the comments.",cxxp0t,,false,/r/india/comments/cxxp0t/for_all_those_nonit_guys_who_want_to_join_the/,Non-Political

**This post will be pretty long but I hope everyone reads it, this needs as much light as it could receive.** 

I have a story to share and I hope people of r/India are able to pick this up boost this any way that they could. I haven't been able to sleep and this has been too much for me to keep within. 

It's about what happened last Friday, 16th August 2019 in Mumbai. I'm a close person of the victim and she was only able to tell me this after 2 days, that is yesterday.  She was extremely traumatized and couldn't build up the courage until I noticed her depression, (her behaviour was unusual and she would puke after eating anything).

I'm going to use antigrams of the Offenders' actual names(without their surname) whereas I'll withhold the victim's name by keeping it anonymous. Will call her Preeti. 

Preeti is 21 Y.O. had been friends with Kausal and Yaradh for 3 years. Studied in the same college. Kausal has been protective of her and also defended and supporter her through her abusive relationship with her ex. You can say, she counted him in the top 5 people in her life. A support system, someone she could look at for answers. A best friend. Yaradh is the kind of guy whose sweetest in the group. calls everyone his sister and pledges to protect them. He called Preeti a sister too! in fact, he's got pictures with her on his Instagram captioned ""best friend? she's more like a sister"". They had a huge group in college but After graduation, mostly only stayed in touch with Kausal and Yaradh. They would usually hang out and chill together. go to pubs and eateries together. She enjoyed their company and always felt protected.

On Wednesday, Yaradh told Preeti that as his parents are away, he's keeping a sleepover party at his place and he's thinking of inviting people from their college group. Preeti was invited. A day before the sleepover party, Yaradh and Kausal decided to not invite anyone except Preeti. Preeti told me about this and I was very sceptic about letting her go but they both were two of the nicest persons in her life. There wasn't any reason for her not to go. 

hours into drinking, Yaradh passes out in another room whereas Kausal and Preeti were in another. Kausal out of nowhere starts crying and then starts to confess his feelings towards her. Preeti tries to calm him down and tells him to try to sleep and then a minute later passes out on the same bed. seconds after regaining her consciousness, Kausal is kissing and groping her. he forcefully tries to undress her as she keeps resisting. he pins her to the wall and puts his pants down trying to do something only until Preeti starts screaming her lungs out. Kausal then gets scared and sits down with his hands on his head. Preeti dresses herself up and runs to another room and sits on the bed being completely horrified of what happened. after staying conscious for 10 mins and crying she passes out again. 

This time, she wakes up to Yaradh putting his hand inside her pants, roughly groping her, while having his pants down and masturbating. She tries to push him away but that only makes him even more aggressive shes able to kick him away and runs out to the living room while Yaradh passes out again. 

Cried sitting in the living room, traumatized and sick, waiting for the trains to start so she could leave the house immediately. 

she built up the courage and told me this 2 days after what happened. I was on the call with her, recorded her whole testimony, called Kausal, asked him to put Yaradh on the conference, recorded both of their confessions. although, Kausal agrees to what he did, Yaradh straightly denies all the allegations. Says he did nothing and he was passed out all the while.

Preeti's parents treat Yaradh and Kausal has their own sons. Also, they are extremely strict. She is dead from within and hasn't been able to recover since last 3 days now. 

We cannot go to the cops nor to the media. I want someone to help me out with options. I want to know what I could do and not feel helpless seeing her like that is breaking me from within. 

\*\*attached is a screenshot of her another friend, who messaged Yaradh after she learnt about this.\*\*",csf5af,,false,/r/india/comments/csf5af/lost_need_support_and_a_direction_to_look_into/,Non-Political

I am a Bengali so it is not very frequent I watch other regional films except hindi but I was just blown away by Syam Pushkaran, Fahadh Faasil and their determination to bring real stories in Indian cinema. We want more such films to bring a true cultural shift from a bollywood frenzy society to a more holistic and inclusive one.

Can I get more such recommendations apart from Angamally Diaries. Thanks",csfphk,,false,/r/india/comments/csfphk/appreciation_thread_kumbalangi_nights_super/,Non-Political

The current placement scenario for ECE peeps is not really bright,with very few core companies hitting the campus,and most students get placed in software. There's a bright side though,some good companies do come(eg Oracle,ABB,Samsung R&amp;D,SAP Labs,Amazon). People of r/India,could y'all please guide me as to how to proceed for these companies. I want to end up working in a product based company.

I have basic knowledge of C/C++ and Python,quite a decent knowledge of Web Development (did HTML/CSS,focussing on Django). My grades are okayish(~7.9),but I couldn't land with any Internship this summer.

I'm practising DS/Algo and doing couple of projects on Django. I will be grateful if someone could guide me on how to proceed for Placements in a timeframe of a year.",csiiic,,false,/r/india/comments/csiiic/advice_regarding_placements/,Non-Political

It has happened to me so many times that I almost saved my phone from facing an unfortunate death.

Today I had to use the internet to book a cab and this fucking piece of shit stopped working immediately.
It was like that for half an hour. If it hadn't been an emergency then I wouldn't have been this angry. What's the point of technology if they won't work for you in an emergency?

Hello,  just some basic information before I get into the issue: my family and I  (mother, father, brother and me) live in a western country. Brother and  I born here. We are not integrated in the local indian community

I  have a boyfriend with whom I have been together for 3 months. We met  through work and liked each other immediately but I refused to date him  because I knew of the consequences. 3 months ago I finally gave in. I am  very happy with him. He is my first boyfriend (im 28).

He  was dropping me off today at home after a trip and my mother saw him  kissing me. When I entered the home she was kind of mad and looked very  disappointed. In general I'm allowed to have a boyfriend. At least thats  what I was always told. My mum went off on how old my boyfriend looks  (he is the same age but looks older due a sickness when he was a baby),  that he isn't the right person, that kissing men is disgusting (my  parents marriage is arranged with my father being much older than my  mother), if I was having sex, that he is not good looking, if I already  met his family, that I went behind her back, she doesn't want to meet  him ever, that I can move out and be with him, that she want cut  ties....

She says that she is not  going to forbid me dating him, but that she never wants to meet him.  Fullstop. My brother and father doesn't know yet. My brother and I are  not really close and he I doubt he could help me as he doesn't talk to  my parents (despite us all living in the same house). My father is  already very old and sick so talking to him isn't an option.

Right  now I feel so alone. I don't know what to do. I have no one to talk too  about this, because I have no indian/asian friends. I feel like im  being torn between my mum and boyfriend. And I feel so bad for my  boyfriend. I have already met his parents and they were so lovely and  welcoming. He is such an amazing guy and now he has a girlfriend with  such a complicated family. I just don't know what to do. Part of me  hopes that my mum will come around because as bad as it sounds she is  still talking to me. But when will that be? next month, one year, ten  years? What am I supposed to tell my boyfriend. I don't want him think  badly about my mum. I know that her issue with this comes from a place  of concern/ignorance and not hate. She still made dinner for me and told  me to stop crying and keep my cool.",cvll1s,,false,/r/india/comments/cvll1s/unsure_how_to_navigate_relationship_with_mother/,Non-Political

Are the indicators or is the system broken? Here's my story, what's yours?","Ticket windows at most small stations in Mumbai are shut post 09:30 PM. I have faced this at multiple stations like Matunga, Vidyavihar, Marine Lines.

&amp;#x200B;

I asked the station master at Marine Lines that where can I get the ticket and he pointed me to other end of the station for which you have to go through the platform or cross a very shady road risking your life at night (same with other stations).

Upon raising the safety concern, he, along with another staff member, tried to attack me physically. I was lucky that a train just halted at station and I ran to board it risking my life further.

&amp;#x200B;

I tweeted to IRCTC and all they did was tag one account after another and nothing ever happened.

&amp;#x200B;

Do not ask me to use AVTM or UTS to book the ticket online. What about those who do not use tech as easily as we all do? Are they allowed to travel ticketless?

&amp;#x200B;

The recent Badlapur incident where a train was stuck in floods and passengers had to be airlifted. IS the system so incompetent that they cannot see the rising water to stop the train before situation goes out of control? It was not a flash flood which caused the issue. It had be raining since a week.

&amp;#x200B;

I might be completely wrong here and missing some critical thought process behind shutting shops and not planning the train signals. So any argument is welcomed but the way Indian Railways is evolving is making me wonder what is our future.

Please contribute.,"I saw a post on r/personalfinance about a lady being approached for an MLM. Which prompted me to make this post about the different and creative ways people do that here in India.

I have been approached a dozen times but the one that stands out is when someone I knew from school mistakenly sent me this text. ""Hey man, as discussed I have transfered 1,83,700  to your account :)) Also, the Singapore trip next month means we have only 21 work days so plan accordingly. Let's keep the momentum rolling.""

I replied right away saying he got the wrong guy. Immediately I get a call from him, apologising for the mistake. My name starts with A and he was trying to send the text to the person right below me in his contact list. I haven't spoken to this chap in years so naturally I ask him how he is and what's he doing these days. Tells me he's been busy making it big, wants to retire early, wants to be financially independent and you know where this is going. It was a 15 minute converation revolving around his lifestyle. We decide to catch up sometime. I cut the phone and block him every possible place I could.

His instagram is a mix of pictures from travels to South East Asian countries, boarding passes, Apple products, his watch collection and generic Yolo brand of quotes.

Fortunately, my MLM radar is off the roof so I have no trouble indetifying such pitches, but I have to give it to this guy, it was beautiful!

* *Prepare for interviews*. Almost all your skills would be useless unless you are able to crack the interviews. Each company has a well-defined interview procedure to hire Software Engineers. By-and-large it is the same for all the companies — 1 screening round (resume shortlisting), 1 coding test, 1–3 rounds of technical interviews. All of the interviews are generally focused on Data Structures and Algorithms, or rather, problem-solving capabilities. Some companies also focus on specific skills for which they are hiring. As an example, if the company is looking to hire a Web Developer, expect questions from your projects on Web Development. Similarly for other skills. I have seen people who complain — why do companies ask Data Structures and Algorithms while I would be working on Mobile App Development? Well, if you want a great job, *stop crying, start preparing*.
* *Diversify your skill set*. At the college fresher level, it is recommended that you should try and be a *jack of all trades, master of none*. This way, you will throw a wider net when you try and reach out to companies. For instance, an ideal resume would have 1–2 Web Development related projects, 1 Mobile App Development project, 1 project around Machine Learning, 1–2 projects around Operating Systems/Databases and obviously an internship experience. I have seen some students who try and specialize in a specific domain — most commonly Machine Learning. I am not saying it is bad but remember, *companies would generally not value your specialization too much, certainly not at the fresher level*. Unfortunately, that’s how it is and you’ll have to live with it.
* *Build a network*. Yes, programming skills are important. However, networking skills are equally important. You should have friends/colleagues who should be willing to help you connect with HR from their company in case you want to shift.
* *Create an online presence (build a personal brand)*. Try contributing back without the expectation of getting anything in return. *You would be amazed to see how much you’ll get back, without even asking*. Today, due to my online presence on Quora, LinkedIn and Facebook, I get an opportunity to connect with so many smart people from all over the world.

THE PATRIOT

Or

A VERY INDIAN POEM IN INDIAN ENGLISH

From *Hymns in Darkness* (1976); Part of a series he called ""Very Indian Poems in Indian English""

&amp;#x200B;

I am standing for peace and non-violence. Why world is fighting fighting  
Why all people of world  
Are not following Mahatma Gandhi,  
I am simply not understanding. Ancient Indian Wisdom is 100% correct,  
I should say even 200% correct,  
But modern generation is neglecting- Too much going for fashion and foreign thing.

Other day I'm reading newspaper  
(Every day I'm reading Times of India  
To improve my English Language)  
How one goonda fellow  
Threw stone at Indirabehn.  
Must be student unrest fellow, I am thinking. Friends, Romans, Countrymen, I am saying (to myself) Lend me the ears.  
Everything is coming -  
Regeneration, Remuneration, Contraception.  
Be patiently, brothers and sisters.

You want one glass lassi?  
Very good for digestion.  
With little salt, lovely drink,  
Better than wine;  
Not that I am ever tasting the wine. I'm the total teetotaller, completely total, But I say  
Wine is for the drunkards only.

What you think of prospects of world peace? Pakistan behaving like this,  
China behaving like that,  
It is making me really sad, I am telling you. Really, most harassing me.  
All men are brothers, no?  
In India also  
Gujaratis, Maharashtrians, Hindiwallahs All brothers -  
Though some are having funny habits. Still, you tolerate me,  
I tolerate you,  
One day Ram Rajya is surely coming.

You are going?  
But you will visit again  
Any time, any day,  
I am not believing in ceremony Always I am enjoying your company.

Decades later, Tamil Nadu women have gone to school, topped female higher education Gross Enrollment Ratio (GER), decreased Infant mortality rate (IMR) increased Female Labour Force Participation (FLFP) and decreased Total fertility rate (TFR). Basically, welfare schemes have made TN OECD equal.

Let's talk about FLFP. [Indian women spend 16 billion hours a day doing unpaid care work](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-women-spend-16-billion-hours-a-day-doing-unpaid-care-work/articleshow/69699732.cms). India's FLFP rate is among the worst in the world. India even trails Pakistan when it comes to FLFP. Indian economy would get a substantial boost if India manages to match China's FLFP. Free bus rides would obviously boost FLFP.

* KL &amp; TN top the list of **Mothers who had at least 4 antenatal care visits.**
* KL &amp; TN top the list of **Women having mobile phones that they themselves use.**
* KL &amp; TN top the list of **Women aged 15-24 with access to menstrual hygiene.**
* KL &amp; TN top the list of **Women who use hygienic methods of protection during their menstrual period.**
* KL &amp; TN top the list of **Institutional births.**
* KL &amp; TN have the **least percentage of women with BMI &lt; 18.5 kg.**


**M Karunanidhi promised and delivered free TVs.** It was derided as a freebie. There's now research to suggest increased penetration of TV in TN contributed to decreasing acceptance of domestic violence by women as a fact of their lives. The free TV actually made a substantial impact to our society.

There was a...

* decrease in the reported acceptability of domestic violence 
* decrease in son preference
* increase in women’s autonomy and participation in household decision-making
* increase in school enrollment for younger children

**Bottom-line:** GDP growth in India suffers far less from the lack of economic reform than from its women and girls being malnourished and illiterate. Send girls to school. Help them. Feed them. Economic growth will take care of itself.

Our immediate neighborhood and the ones around are littered with pubs and bars owing to the large population of college students and foreigners. 

However, yesterday being Independence day, most of these places were shut. Almost all “pure veg” restaurants and some good spots were open. 

Driving down these streets (a 3KM route) takes approximately 20-25mins with light to medium traffic. Yesterday owing to the national holiday and dry day, it took us 10min. Mostly empty streets populated by the locals there and others who have come out for dining. 

Even at the restaurant, there was calm music playing (we actually expected the general loud music that plays when alcohol is being served) and had made plans to leave early. Considering how relaxed the environment was, and the servers also looked relaxed than usual (although the place was full) was very refreshing. Possibly the best time I’ve personally had there. 

Oh, and before I forget: food was the best I’ve had there since I started going there. 

**Disclaimer**: both of us are casual drinkers and we sometimes enjoy a beer each (at most) when dining outside, we’ve started to actively avoid places that frequented by drinkers than diners (people preferring to drink more than eat and vice-versa).

At least two of my regular places have went to shit after Swiggy bullshit took over.

Dine in area basically feels like extended kitchen. Employees randomly packing orders wherever they want. No proper fans or lighting. 

Other suspicious things like selling tandoori chicken and shawarma when both of equipment clearly hasn't been used for some time.

They used to have hot tandoor baking fresh chicken one side and fresh shawarma on another throughout the day.

Now they probably just make it in bulk, then heat it up whenever ordered.

I also noticed a dip in proper manner/courtesy. Dine in customers are probably no longer their primary customers and they treat you like that. 

Then there is also the repulsive business model of companies involved.

Honestly someone should start a trend of ""This hotel/restaurants does not take orders from Swiggy/Zomato"" places. Like those ""Veg only"" places.",cm4btg,,false,/r/india/comments/cm4btg/anyone_else_noticed_the_dip_in_quality_of_local/,Non-Political

I live in Mumbai, and my dad and I got pulled over for ""breaking"" the red light in our car at Saki Naka. Anyone who has travelled through Saki Naka during the metro construction knows how meaningless the red lights were at that time.

Before letting us go, the cop gave us his copy of the challan and said in his typical Mumbai accent, ""*Yachya magey sign kara ani liha* \[sign your name on the back and write\]... I have paid the *phhaine* and *receiveda* my *lesson*!""

Really, they make you write that now? Sorry Lord, I will never ever break a traffic light again, *deva shappath* \[God promise\]!

I couldn't hold back peals of laughter. That earned an angry glare from the cop and an almost-escaped-but-controlled-at-the-last-minute grin from Dad.

""I have paid my fine and...?"" my dad asked him writing down the words.

""And received my *LAAISENCE*!"" the cop replied grumpily.

After launching five successful book giveaways — [first](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9z3lxo/hello_i_am_giving_away_free_copies_of_1984_by/), [second](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a22a3v/hello_i_am_giving_away_free_copies_of_animal_farm/), [third] (https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a7vzda/hello_i_am_giving_away_free_copies_of_both_the/), [fourth] (https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/az1i04/hello_i_am_giving_away_free_copies_of_crime_and/), [fifth] (https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cbccez/hello_i_am_giving_away_free_copies_of_brave_new/) — and getting tremendous responses by everyone, I decided to do this more often. Although I am planning to make this a monthly thing, it'd require some time to set it up. I'll've to arrange proper system and channels to ease the process, and have more transparency and automation. I am already on it! ��

**UPDATE #1**: The giveaway is still on! I am just taking a break and going to sleep a little :3 I'll continue again in the morning.

**UPDATE #2**: I'm sorry for people who missed out in the giveaway. It is only because you either shared the wrong link, or you haven't checked the third-party shipping box when you made the WishList (which is a crucial step to receive gifts!) That is to say, you didn't followed the steps mentioned in the post properly. I don't select people, I try to cover everyone here. If you missed out, please read the steps properly, and DM me the link again, I'll send the book right away! :)

**The Trial by Franz Kafka**

On The Trial: This is an iconic piece of literature! It shows the insanity of modern bureaucracy. The protagonist is arrested, but can’t seem to find out what he’s accused of. As he navigates a labyrinthine network of bureaucratic traps—a dark parody of the legal system—he keeps doing things that make him look guilty. Kafka become more and more ""realistic"", as our world turns more and more [""Kafkaesque""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkPR4Rcf4ww) (which also describes an aspect of society analogous to living under a totalitarian state.) Kafka can show the absurdity of ""justice"" in a world where power trumps reason, and political strength trumps fairness. I think you'll be left with a lot to think from Kafka's observations on human psychology and behavior. The book feels like a dream. The timeline of events are weird, there are no explanations, no logical sense of events. There'll be a lot of unanswered questions. It leaves the reader with an overwhelming sense of perplexity. But landing on the right questions is very liberating. 


Quotes from the book:

&gt; “One must lie low, no matter how much it went against the grain, and try to understand that this great organization remained, so to speak, in a state of delicate balance, and that if someone took it upon himself to alter the dispositions of things around him, he ran the risk of losing his footing and falling to destruction, while the organization would simply right itself by some compensating reaction in another part of its machinery – since everything interlocked – and remain unchanged, unless, indeed, which was very probable, it became still more rigid, more vigilant, severer, and more ruthless.”

&gt; “It is not necessary to accept everything as true, one must only accept it as necessary.”  “A melancholy conclusion,” said K. “It turns lying into a universal principle.”

1565032107,pyaarmedooba,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cmfd8a/i_just_broke_up_and_i_feel_nothing/,24,22,,,I just broke up and I feel nothing,"We had been dating for more than a year now, for context, she's in college and I have been working for the last 2 years now.

We have wildly different personalities in many ways, she's quite the open minded kind in experimenting with things (like trying out something wild to eat when she sees some street vendor selling it on the street, while I am a little averse to eating something like that).

Our families know that we are seeing each other and they are ok with it. The problem started out when I was about to leave for my masters and gave my tests for it, but then she happened, not trying to blame her for this, but I just wanted to feel this too. Falling in love and pursuing her. I decided to not go for my masters and it's not something which I have regretted.

I think it's just my inherent thought process, that I want stability for things and I asked her if she was open to idea of marriage later when the time came. She was initially very against the idea of wedding itself, as she saw it as something which would be used to tie down a woman. But she knew that I was feminist. Fast forward, she agreed to the idea of it and is ok with it.

She has this habit of interrupting all the time in the middle of a heated discussion and has caused a lot of problems with me feeling very angry most of the times. She has had depression and has insane mood swings some times, it gets to me that she only has 2 friends and the other one being someone who doesn't even consider her a great friend. Maybe this gets to me, me being someone who has always had friends around me and not having any difficulty in making friends. She has always been a star kid in school, but her opinions have always made her someone who was bullied constantly.

I am not sure if it's something common, but we used to fight every single day for sometime and it got very caustic. I thought it was best to break things off given the complication of things and the fact that she was making me stay somewhere in the middle for even starting a family, but it's fair from her side too. She's too young! Maybe I am not someone who can deal with all this uncertainity as I want to try out new things in my life and maybe move out of here (she doesn't like the idea at all and has told me she never wants to move outside), on starting a family, she hates kids (which is fine) and is a complete opposite for me who loves kids and would want one when I start a family.

I dunno if I have done the right thing or not, it feels that I may or may not regret this, but I feel the peace of mind with constantly not fighting with someone you love, the feeling of not feeling uncertain about something is something which I would like to experience.

I am not sure if this feeling of emptiness is common after a breakup, trying to keep myself busy with reading books.

Sorry for the rant.  


EDIT: I know it's stupid to delay my masters for a girl, but I really wanted to experience this, what it felt like. And give it a shot, we did and it didn't work out I guess.   


Regarding starting a family, she used to tell me that give her time till she graduates and asked me to wait till that time. When I asked, can the answer be a no too? She said yes, I felt it was best that I don't sign up for this possible heartbreak later. Maybe we both come from different phases in life.",cmfd8a,,false,/r/india/comments/cmfd8a/i_just_broke_up_and_i_feel_nothing/,Non-Political

And was returning as the train started moving. There was this guy PWD guy, had walking difficulties (had a walking stick in hand, so I'm believing he was having a medical condition), was running towards the train as he was yelling for help because his kids were in the train. There were policeman with him but they didn't bothered running to inform the train. Train at this moment had its tail on the end of station. I thought the train had stopped and didn't moved either. But to me surprise it didn't and continued to move out. 

There are only two groups at fault:
1. The policemen who accompanied him but didn't bothered to run and catch the train to pull chains
2. Everyone at the station, including myself. I feel bad that I didn't even tried to do anything. I could've contacted my relatives to pull the chain....
I feel really bad now. I hope the railway department would help him contact his kids and take them to the police station till someone of their family would arrive.

The order was supposed to reach yesterday between 6 AM - 9 AM, but it didn't. It was around 10 AM when I called the delivery guy and he said that he will be delivering the order till 12. The order got more delayed somehow and the ETA was pushed till 6 PM. At around 6:45 I got a notification that the order was delivered but it wasn't. So i hurriedly called the delivery guy and he said that he was standing outside my house for 10-15 mins and he tried to call me but couldn't connect. Could he not ring the bell for once? And he marked the order as delivered too. So that was it, I told him to come again as I will be outside the gate this time. He was not ready to come but upon pleading numerous times he reluctantly agreed to come once again.

When he came to deliver, he hurriedly placed the items on the floor and was going out of the house. He didn't even let me check the products. He said that he had to deliver some more orders and he left. When I was counting the products I found that most of them were badly damaged. The shampoo had leaked and had seeped into other things. There was also dirt and sticky sugar on it. The boxes of biscuits were crushed. So i raised a complaint from inside the app, I also sent them pics to verify. Upon seeing that they refunded the amount of the damaged products to the grofers wallet.

But today morning when I woke up, I see that the money which they had credited to the wallet has been debited back. I tried the in app customer support, they were ignoring me and they weren't replying. I called the customer support and they said the amount has been debited back and they will issue a return back of the products and will deliver them once again or credit the money to the wallet. I checked the order tab to see the date and time of the initiated return of the products after about 30 mins or so. And to my surprise, they had not issued any return back order. I tried to call them once again and this time the call was not getting through. Everytime I called, I was getting connected to some alarm company overseas and everytime a Ross came on the line. This was not Grofers support but it was the same number which i had talked to 30 mins earlier. When I tried to access my account I was not able to. They had conveniently locked me out of my account. I had some more money in that wallet which I couldn't access now. This is borderline theft. Never had I experienced such scammy service ever in my life. Fuck Grofers.

Edit - [We regret to inform you that once an account is flagged by our system it is not within the bounds of possibility to reverse the same by manual intervention.](https://i.vgy.me/XiJ5a5.png) haha..what a joke this is..they have delivered me damaged products of over ₹500 and my wallet had over ₹800. They duped my ₹1300. This is a scam. 
  


Tl;dr : Items in my order were damaged, got a refund for that, refunded amount was debited back again on promise of return of the products with good ones or cashback, was locked out of my account with some money left in the wallet which are gone now.",cri7ah,,false,/r/india/comments/cri7ah/just_wanted_to_share_my_pathetic_experience_with/,Non-Political

I have trouble in receiving payment. In past I have received the payment through PayPal but the company that is paying have limit on PayPal transaction for $5k.

I have sent them my bank details for wire transfer but they replied, ""We are unable to wire into that account, our bank told us that our bank doesn't have agreement signed with your bank, which means we can not wire in any currency other than your local one, and our bank doesn't sell your currency.""


The country of the company is Poland and their bank name is ""Bank millennium"". https://www.bankmillennium.pl/

I have a issue in my current bank too because of receiving $15k from PayPal in last three months, they are telling me to convert bank account from saving account to current account.

I have properly submitted ITR with the help of CA this year but he have worked for local clients only (tier-3 Indian city) so he as well many other C.A. in my locality don't have much knowledge regarding international transactions. So, please help me out.

What will be the optimal way to receive international payment through bank wire?

Which Indian bank will be best? (Most of the bank branch are not SWIFT enabled, please suggest 2-3 banks so one of then might be available in my town)

Should I get a firm registered and open a current account too?

1566051557,Ailaoan,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/crmpjj/which_relatively_large_indian_cities_have_unique/,0,5,,,Which relatively large Indian cities have unique landscapes?,"As we all know most cities are built on plains, some are inland and some are coastal, besides the skyscrapers they are not exactly interesting to look at. As a person interested in geography, I love seeing pictures of cities with unique landscapes as a part of urban area, as a person from China, I tend to follow the Chinese standard and only consider cities with 1 million+ population 'relatively large' cities, because I wish to see taller buildings constructed to fit in the environment and many so-called cities in Europe or North America look like small towns or even villages by Chinese and I believe Indian standard too, hence I posted here. 

Some examples from China: 

City on plateau-[Xining wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xining#Administrative_divisions)(Population: 2,371,100), it has an elevation of 2,275 m, [Xining video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6NUYdVLE1E&amp;t=66s).

City on archipelago-[Zhoushan wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhoushan)(Population: 1,152,000), it has 1,390 islands, [Zhoushan video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kU9uqWyezsI).

City with karst-[Guilin wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guilin)(Population: 4,747,963), it is a part of the [South China Karst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China_Karst), [Guilin video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4K1BrYt080).

These cities are what people call [prefecture-level city](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefecture-level_city) in China, some are pretty urbanized, some administer rural areas too, but most of them still have an urban area populous enough to have some high-rises. Again, cities with 1 million+ population, urban areas have unique landscapes, videos would be better, thank you.",crmpjj,,false,/r/india/comments/crmpjj/which_relatively_large_indian_cities_have_unique/,Non-Political

Everyone is proud. Meanwhile I'm tired of this bullshit.,"Abhinanda Ghosh, a student of IX Std, has scored well in the Olympiads ( 3rd position in international science olympiad according to the local news ) and is going to NASA for 3 months of training. This has made the local people super proud on social media especially Facebook. 
Meanwhile some misfits like me, are feeling demotivated and uninspired. How can we change this culture in our country?

*Downvote not because of you disagree, but only if you feel this discussion brings nothing new to the table.*

**Now, on to the meat:**Most sources (especially international) that discuss the Partition often mention that it was the result of a series of wrong decisions made by powerful people; that the average Hindu and the average Muslim on the street considered each other equals despite all their differences. Any historian worth their salt should be able to see beyond such claims, into a valley of violence forged over a thousand years between these two groups. A good source would be Ambedkar, who makes some fine points in his treatise on the [Partition](http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/ambedkar_partition/).  Speaking of the deep-rooted animosity between the two religions,  Ambedkar explains that starting with the very first invasion of India by the Muslim invaders from the north-west, the hatred between the two has only kept on increasing. The natural consequence of these events was that by the time we get to the Partition era, Hindus and Muslims did not look upon each other as friends:

&gt;The methods adopted by the invaders have left behind them their aftermath. One aftermath is the bitterness between the Hindus and the Muslims which they have caused. This bitterness between the two is so deep-seated that a century of political life has neither succeeded in assuaging it, nor in making people forget it. As the invasions were accompanied with. destruction of temples and forced conversions, with spoliation of property, with slaughter,, enslavement and abasement of men, women and children, what wonder if the memory of these invasions has ever remained green, as a source of pride to the Muslims and as a source of shame to the Hindus? But these things apart, this north-west corner of India has been a theater in which a stern drama has been played. Muslim hordes, in wave after wave, have surged down into this area and from thence scattered themselves in spray over the rest of India. These reached the rest of India in thin currents. In time, they also receded from their farthest limits; while they lasted, they left a deep deposit of Islamic culture over the original Aryan culture in this north-west corner of India which has given it a totally different color, both in religious and political outlook. The Muslim invaders, no doubt, came to India singing a hymn of hate against the Hindus. But, they did not merely sing their hymn of hate and go back burning a few temples on the way. That would have been a blessing. They were not content with so negative a result. They did a positive act, namely, to plant the seed of Islam. The growth of this plant is remarkable. It is not a summer sapling. It is as great and as strong as an oak. Its growth is the thickest in Northern India. The successive invasions have deposited their 'silt' more there than anywhere else, and have served as watering exercises of devoted gardeners. Its growth is so thick in Northern India that the remnants of Hindu and Buddhist culture are just shrubs. Even the Sikh axe could not fell this oak. Sikhs, no doubt, became the political masters of Northern India, but they did not gain back Northern India to that spiritual and cultural unity by which it was bound to the rest of India before Hsuan Tsang. The Sikhs coupled it back to India. Still, it remains like Alsace-Lorraine politically detachable and spiritually alien so far as the rest of India is concerned. It is only an unimaginative person who could fail to take notice of these facts or insist in the face of them that Pakistan means breaking up into two what is one whole.

Some historians argue that the deeper Hindu-Muslim divide - the kind that  has manifested itself in riots against Muslims, for instance - is a consequence of the British invasion and the nationalism it sowed. Romila Thapar, for example, [claims](http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00islamlinks/txt_thapar_somnath.html) that Ghazni's invasions of India and the subsequent destruction of  Indian temples by his hand should not be considered an instance of  'Hindu-Muslim enmity', because he punished Muslim heretics just as he  did the Hindus, but that makes no difference to the average Hindu - as  far as he is concerned, Islamic conquerors made an attempt to wipe out  the history and religion of a land that never made any efforts to  disturb other nations. And so in his mind, the religions simply cannot get along after all that has transpired between them. In thinking so he would find the Muslims agreeing as well: they themselves were of the opinion that the two religions were fundamentally incompatible; like two immiscible fluids they'd try to fight to get on top of each other and eventually settle to a compromise. According to MJ Akbar, even the so-called ""Muslim reformers"" - such as Sir Syed Ahmad Khan - were ""[addressing the native Hindus as apes as late as the 1870](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09700161.2011.628465?journalCode=rsan20)"". Khan was the first figure in the history of modern India who propounded  the theory that Hindus and Muslims practiced incompatible religions. He, in turn, was influenced by great Muslim thinkers such as Shah Wali Ullah, who was preaching the Muslims about the ""dangers of living with Hindus"" in the 18th century, [and made public his hopes for renewed  Islamic dominion over the Hindus](http://www.southasiaanalysis.org/paper629).

This is where your average 'sanghi' or 'bhakt' in the Partition era drew motivation from: his genuine fear that the religion that had pillaged and looted its way across their country for over half a millennium would reign over him once again. The historic wrong made against their religion that was content on living and dying on its own piece of land deserves to be rectified. The Hindu way of life, complete  with its culture and other pieces of its identity (language, festivals, cuisines) must not die out after having endured for over two thousand years; instead, it should be restored to its glory before the Islamic invasions. The Muslim, given the chance, wastes no time in aggressively  preaching and spreading the word of Islam; the Hindus should do the same in the name of their religion. The decades after the Partition saw  yearly riots and strained relations between the two groups. Notably, the '64 Kolkata riots and the '69 Gujarat riots led to widespread loss of property and lives and established the RSS as ""Hindu protectors"". Things took a turn for the worse in 1971, when during the Bangladesh Liberation War, [Hindus and Buddhists became the targets of extreme violence](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-21712655) and threatened  the state of Hindu-Muslim relations in the country. The Kashmiri exodus made matters worse and finally, India and Pakistan fought an all-out war in 1999 where many radical Hindus hoped that their neighbor's forces would be vanquished once and for all. By this time, nationalist parties had already made their presence felt across the country and many political figures had publicly made known their allegiance to Hinduism.  But the visions and ideas of these fundamentalists mutate into something more radical as we enter the 21th century.

Islam, for all its religious dogma and intolerance (against homosexuals, women's rights, freedom of religion, etc.) ends up becoming a darling of the West in the  by the end of the 20th century. Plenty of countries style themselves as  'Islamic Republics' and proudly advertise their rich history of conquest and murder. [Citizens of these countries were forced to live  under the shadow of Islam regardless of their opinions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination_against_atheists#Muslim-majority_countries), are forced to study their religion and embrace it in all its glory.  Before migrations from the middle-east to European countries became a major phenomenon, the average Indian view was that the citizens of such states actually didn't mind these theocracies. And while Islamophobia was certainly a thing in the West, the radical Left started making noises about this supposed discrimination and made it an object of  public discussion. In 1988, after Rushdie's Satanic Verses made headlines because of the fatwa issued against him, we saw a few loud  voices actually defending the horrific treatment that was being meted out against him. Yasmin Alibhai Brown, a self proclaimed 'anti-racist' Muslim, had this to say about the reaction to Rushdie's book:

&gt;I felt quite comfortable within the liberal camp until the Salman Rushdie affair. I thought those who believed in religion were backward. The Rushdie affair changed all that. I was shocked by the way that the liberals, who proclaimed their belief in freedom of thought and expression, were completely unwilling to listen to the voice of very  powerless people who felt offended by the book \[...\] My liberal associates were talking about them (the people against Rushdie) in terms of pure hatred. But it was not just the hatred which angered me. It was also the way the liberals totally misunderstood people's continuing need for religion, particularly among members of Muslim groups who are still finding it hard to find their place in British society.

By 1998, Islamophobia had become a genuine synonym for racism and quite a few Western governments found themselves fighting against it (see the [Runnymede report](https://www.runnymedetrust.org/companies/17/74/Islamophobia-A-Challenge-for-Us-All.html) for an example). In stark contrast Hinduism had few voices ""speaking out"" for its defense against racism (which basically meant its interactions with Islam), which irked the radicals - while it was true that they craved a homogeneous Hindu nation, at the very least they were not violently overthrowing sovereign governments (Afghanistan) or waging wars against their neighbors (Pakistan-funded militants). No sir, they were content with fighting for their land (remember, all violence towards the Muslims was justified in one way or the other); and if the world could turn a blind-eye to the Taliban doing the same thing (hell, [Sayed Rahmatullah Hashemi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayed_Rahmatullah_Hashemi) of the Taliban was even invited to the US to meet the President!), what right did they have to chastise the Hindu fundamentalists who 'merely' wanted to purge their own lands? With the fight against Islamophobia raging around them, they feared that the Western governments would see their innocent, justified actions against Muslims as acts of genocide, which would bolster Islam's standing in the world. And more glory to Islam, compounded by their higher growth rate (29.5% vs 19.5% for the Hindus), could once again lead to a situation where Muslims would rule over their Hindu counterparts.

Now, one could accuse them of exaggeration here, but they'd need to be careful: while it is true that numbers-wise India would retain a Hindu majority until 2050 (and beyond), the ""Hindus"" that the fundamentalists hope will populate the  nation are the ones who actually follow the religion, rather than just being born into it (atheists were probably none of their concern: a growing number of people started abandoning religion at the beginning of  the 21st century, but this number is minuscule - less than a percent of  the nation's population). The truth on the ground was that while Islam  enjoyed status as a 'state religion' in several densely populated countries of the world, 'Hinduism' enjoyed no such privileges. Mythological stories were not being taught across middle-class schools, the Vedas were not being studied by eminent scholars in clerical universities; instead, a 'pop' version of the religion was flourishing through TV shows and movies. Your average Hindu was certainly pious -  they'd go to the temple, not eat meat on certain days, not cut their  finger-nails in the evenings, etc. - but they weren't advertising their religion, they weren't truly embracing the culture that came along with it. And how did they reach this conclusion? Surely, even they could see  the ever-growing crowds of people at religious festivals across the country or the number of people tuning in to watch B.R. Chopra's epics on the TV? Yes they could, but what was most necessary for a Hindu,  according to them, was to always defend their religion against the ever-present threat of Islam. Why weren't they advocating for the study of religious texts in schools? Why weren't they rallying to make cattle-slaughter illegal? Their fervor ended at the doorsteps of their houses and they did not truly carry the zeal for Hinduism in their hearts, their actions were merely byproducts of the culture around them, which was slowly but surely declining.

But they had a solution! Once Hinduism pervaded every aspect of life - like it had in the days before Islam or in the Hindu kingdoms such as those of Shivaji - the  general populace would undoubtedly notice the richness of this religion. So the 2000s come and goes - Gujarat burns again, the BJP's agenda turns ominous after Vajpayee's term ends, social media takes off and the left starts making itself heard. Islamophobia surges once again after 9/11, but saner voices prevail in the end (for the most part), and those disgusted by the mistreatment of Islam speak out loudly. Hindu radicals don't back down, of course; they double up and start an information war against the extreme liberals that advocate for greater protection for minorities. Why do they need protections, after all; Hinduism is the religion under threat, not Islam! The Hindu culture is slowly diluting and if the left can't speak out against the atrocities of Islam - of its brutal culture against LGBT people, treatment of women, etc. - then why does it pester the Hindus who merely act out in the defense of their culture? How could a religion that instructs its followers to kill all non-believers ever be in need of further protection? And this brings us to the crux of this post: in a warped sense, their thinking is actually understandable.

Yes, the media generally never chastised Islam for its toxicity until very recently.

Yes, the Muslim population really was rising significantly faster than the Hindu population.

Yes,  Islamic countries often tend to be based around religion (and a religion which punishes atheism probably does exhibit slightly ""more  devout"" followers).

Yes, it is OK to feel a deep attachment to your religion and believe in your connection to a higher power through it.

Yes, it is perfectly alright to want to preserve and grow your religion and its culture (languages, art, stories, etc.).

And yes, ultimately, it is understandable to want to return your religion to its ""former glory"", if you really feel it's been harshly treated for the past millennium. And your average student of history - who has at  least once encountered an act of Islamic barbarity in Indian history - probably feels that way too, not just your right-wing nutjobs.

So the question ""do the ends justify the means?"" carries no weight to the fundamentalist, be they Islamic or Hindu. Of course they do, it's our basic ""us-vs-them"" instinct that's been honed over a 100,000 years or so. For radical elements on either side of the divide, the fear of having their cultural identity rooted-out from a region has always been a potent rallying cry, capable of garnering support for violence even in the darkest times. But we aren't justifying or dissecting the Islamic fundamentalist POV here - we are digging into the motivation behind ""saffron terror"" (although that somehow ties radicalism with the RSS, which is partly incorrect in my opinion), and deep down, like perhaps all conflicts in history, it is rooted in blood.

EDIT - 

**TLDR:** *Just like Islamic fundamentalism, the Hindu radical elements have sprung from the desire of preserve their religion in the face of 'religious invasions'. And similar to Israel's bullying, the end-goal of their agenda is to ensure that the tables never turn against them ever again, instead of the constant back-and-forth that they have had over the past 1000 years.*",co4qwx,,false,/r/india/comments/co4qwx/unpopular_opinion_the_bhaktsanghi_idealogy_is/,Non-Political

I wanted to extend an invitation for you all to join us over at /r/IndianMuslims.

We're a fairly new sub that are largely focused on issues related to the Indian Muslim community at home and abroad and wanted to reach out to the broader Reddit Indian community. We'd love for our fellow Indians to join us in discussions and exploring our shared history and culture.

As most of you may know, India has the 3rd largest population of Muslims in the world (2nd by other estimates) despite only making 15-18% of the entire population in India. However, this has still led to a lot of misconceptions about the Muslims of India, our culture, our religious views, politics, etc. by both our fellow Indians and the broader Muslim community.

/r/IndianMuslims serves to give the Muslims of India as well as the diaspora of Indian Muslims on Reddit, a platform to discuss the many political and social issues affecting our community. We also aim to explore the Islamic culture of India through art, history, architecture, film, music, food, poetry, and other important factors that make us who we are in relation to India and the wider Muslim world.

All are welcomed, whether you are Muslim or non-Muslim, Indian or non-Indian. It doesn’t matter where you live, whether in India, Middle East/Gulf countries, North America, etc., you are all welcomed to be a part of our community.

Hope to see you all soon!

The startup I've worked kept on changing the platform, which resulted in me spending most of the time learning new tech, and very little time on actually doing stuff. And to add to my woes, a project which I was working on for a client of the startup got abandoned ( the client took whatever we did so far and probably gave it someone else).  Now I have no specific tech that I'm good at, no projects to showcase myself, which leaves me in a very bad state in the eyes of prospective employers.

I am applying everywhere, but I'm getting rejected and failing to clear interviews. Now, suppose I got laid off,  and I failed to land in another job for some months, is that considered too bad?

Fake news, health tips, advice, stories, quotes. They are all aware of the fake news issues but still exercise no caution.","With my parents I used to explain it to them, but they would never take heed. I finally got them to stop and exercise caution by openly embarrassing them in group chats by disproving their stories. But I can't do this with my relatives (my parents are laid back).

It honestly seems like most of the information that gets passed around in India is either fake or selective, only reading the stories that match your outlook. 

One instance that angered me a lot was when my uncle shared a video of Muslims in Karnataka rioting against dalits. I noticed all the signboard in this video were in Bengali, I looked it up and found it was a video of a riot in Bangladesh from 10 years back. I told this to him, and told him there was no Muslim rioting in Karnataka. He responded even if it's fake the ""meaning"" is real. wtf is that supposed to mean?

In speaking to a Muslim co worker she informed she gets similar fake news only in reverse. Photos of Palestine and Iraq getting passed over as Kashmir or Uttar Pradesh.

Fake news is making communities live in their own separate fictional realities. And these days people spent more time online then they do speaking to those in their neighborhood. Our reality is warped.

And that's just for politics. Forget the ridiculous claims that cancer can be treated by drinking fruit juice and that Buddha gives advice on how to make lots of money.

Honestly after some thinking I think the root of fake news is confirmation bias. People want to share and believe news that confirms how they already feel. Since most Indians have this false belief that ""natural"" = good they automatically believe claims that fruit juice cures cancer and vaccines cause autism. Only way to fight it is to challenge the belief that natural is not good by default. Same with my dumbass uncle, who thinks Muslims are troublemakers and thus will share any such news even if he knows it's fake.",cxgpl9,,false,/r/india/comments/cxgpl9/23rds_of_what_my_family_shares_with_me_over/,Non-Political

My family is looking for someone from our community and today something incredibly funny happened. My sister has a boyfriend from work but is afraid to tell dad (me and mom already know) , but that is a different story.

We recieved a 'rishta' from some distant relative of some distant relative. 
Even before talking about my sister, they said that have a few demands and the first one of them being 50L cash as dowry. Can you fucking imagine?

But that's not the funny part. It was explicitly stated that 50L is the demand of the guy and not his parents. He said that his parents will have other demands once we move forward with the 'rishta'. Now the thing is, that the guy is not even a graduate and just runs his father's truck business. They might be well off but that is just because of something his ancestors built. How can someone, who is not even self made, be so demanding ?

1564891598,lovejackdaniels,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cls3p1/indian_government_borrows_money_at_46_higher/,7,29,,,Indian government borrows money at 4-6% higher interest rate than most of developed countries,"This is a bit technical topic so I have tried to simplify it with some approximations.

Governments across the world need to borrow money to manage their day to day finances. These are in form of bonds. The money borrowed is given by investors (such as banks, worldwide specialist funds, other country's central banks) which demand a certain interest rate to lend money to a government. Another dimension is maturity of loan (does government want 1 yr loan, 2 yr loan, 5 yr loan, 10 yr loan, 20, 30 yr loan).

One of the most popular series is to compare interest rate on a 10 yr loan paid by various countries. While India has a yield (read as interest rate for simplification) of 6.4% for 10 yr bond, countries like Switzerland, Germany, France, Japan have a negative interest rate. This means investors are 'okay' losing money for holding money in these countries. Imagine taking a home loan and paying negative interest rate on it.

https://i.redd.it/m8c1akikozd31.png

**Highlights**

* *In brief:* On July 30th, 2019, Truecaller users faced automatic registration of their unified payments interface (UPI) based IDs without their knowledge and consent. Truecaller representatives have attributed the issue to the result of a ""software bug"".
* *We write to the NPCI*:  The magnitude of such a security breach has brought to the forefront the continued lack of data protection and security measures available to the users of the online sphere. We write to the NPCI suggesting a few measures to consider in addressing these issues.

We would like to thank Srikanth Lakshmanan (@logic), Anand Venkatanarayanan ([**@iam\_anandv**](https://twitter.com/iam_anandv)), Srinivas Kodali ([**@digitaldutta**](https://twitter.com/digitaldutta)) and Abhay Rana ([**@captn3m0**](https://twitter.com/captn3m0)) for their technical inputs and analysis, without which IFF would not have been able to address the issue.

### The Breach

On 30.07.2019, media reports and various user complaints brought to light an issue that caused the automatic registration of unified payments interface (UPI) based IDs of Truecaller users without their knowledge and consent. Users reported an indecipherable SMS sent out with a response later received through their banks alerting them to a UPI based registration. Both the official twitter handle for TrueCaller and representatives of Truecaller have indicated the issue to be the result of a “software bug”.

### Time to be accountable

Truecaller has become a widely used service that does not only identify incoming calls from unknown numbers but also offers payments services through the use of UPI. This payment method is governed by the National Payments Corporation of India set up with the support of the RBI. In light of this, we [**write to the NPCI**](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1IeG8YsMJradxS3cvNPrSYA80T5Jz3fWL) on the systemic deficiencies that need recognition and suggest steps in addressing security and data protection issues:

Immediate steps:

1. *Technical assessment*: The NPCI should investigate this security breach and provide information on the bug but also on its impact to each user.  Further steps include an audit of other payment platforms that utilise UPI.

*Intermediary steps:*

1. *Complaint and redressal mechanism:* A complaint addressing mechanism with a structurally designated office and channels for redressal focused on data/privacy/technology issues, available to the users should be put into place by NPCI. In line with this, there is need for structure;  
2. *Establish a working group for oversight:* If not already in existence, in order to review security and data management practices through UPI, an independent working group should be created to conduct investigations, provide best practices for UPI and periodically review the platform, ecosystem partners.
3. *Architecture documentation:*  Public facing technologies need documentation of all aspects of the technology to create trust and establish norms on correct use. The working group should strive to put all architecture documentation in the public domain to help researchers determine if any such vulnerability exists.

While the concerns for such breaches of user consent, security and data continue to loom, all hope is certainly not lost! With the support of such enthusiastic rights oriented individuals, civil society organisations and even cooperative companies, user rights and protections will triumph.   
IFF as always, will continue to ensure your digital rights bloom in this gloom.

1) Campa Cola Building in Mumbai: 
The builder illegally build 17 floors instead of 5, somehow the extra 11 floors were invisible to the authorities.
The buyers were duped by the builder and they lost their life savings and came on the road after their building was demolished. 
When the cities of the world are growing vertically, did it hurt the government so much that they could have allowed the building. After all in order to accommodate the growing population in the future the government itself will encourage cities to grow vertically.

When the building were being demolished the residents did a peaceful sit in, how did the police respond by doing a lathi charge on them.

2) Sealing in Delhi:
Okay so this one is a bit tricky. Certain commercial activities did make life difficult for residents. But a solution could be reached for that , so that the person is able to earn is livelihood and the residents are not disturbed as well. Something I would like to point out in this is that in sealing of Amar Colony Lajpat Nagar 4 the traders were themselves the residents as well. So they didn't have any problems.

Sealing of Defence Colony market, so this was a market so the residential aspect really doesn't come into this. They just sealed it on technicalities.

Did the government think where it will provide the employment to the business owners and employees of the seal establishment.

The traders did a peaceful dharna, how did the government respond, well their response was somewhat similar to the above Campa Cola response.

3) I read a post on Reddit where someone said that the 10 year tax liabilities of salaried professionals were being scrutinised and heavy penalties to the tune of 10 lac plus were imposed and in some cases jail. Think about it for technicalities a person was jailed, whereas if you go to the police station to register a complaint for a serious crime the police outright refuse to register it. And this is for salaried professionals think about what honest businesses and startups have to cough up. No wonder experienced hardened business men are committing suicide.

4) Greater Noida Housing Fiasco:

So the Land in Greater Noida was acquired by the Uttar Pradesh Government, and this is important by that it was done by the government. And then land was sold to developers to make homes, the developers do so. Now after two years suddenly there is ruckus that land was acquired 'illegally' because of which the projects were stalled for five years. Then the housing market slowed down and the builders collapsed. 
Now let's say you are a prospective home buyer, you say you don't want a campa cola like situation, so you scout greater Noida projects, you see the land has been acquired by the government. The projects are being built under the Greater Noida Authority aegis. But despite that due diligence look what happened. The homebuyer thinks he's dammed if he did and dammed if he didn't.

5) Now let's say I am a middle class Indian, I work hard and save that money. Now I want to invest said money. I look at real estate and see Campa Cola and Greater Noida and the housing crisis and I say nope not here. I see the Equity markets and think outside of the inherent market risk what can go wrong ? Well the LTCG gets removed and ILFS gets exposed.

I can go on and on.

The point I am trying to make here is not that this government is bad or that government is bad. And I also agree that all of the above projects have a different reasons because of which they didn't work out. What I am trying to do here is to nurture a environment for healthy discussion as to why successive governments from both sides of the spectrum have tried to make the rich poorer rather than try to bring people out of poverty.

Also before I am called a Sanghi or a Congi, I am not pointing fingers at any particular government. The problem seems to be systemic and a lot of these problems like ILFS started in previous government and continued in the current government, so there is a problem that is not specific to one party.

[Edit: at the suggestion of u/abtam11, I am adding a link to a video that highlights some aspects of the bill. https://youtu.be/8l0wPyLQSDg]

Between Teen Talak, Chandrayan, nationwide floods, Article 370 and Economic crash most of you must not have noticed the National Medical Commission Bill (NMC) that was sneaked into the parliament and passed in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha recently. This bill that shakes the healthcare system of the country to the core (and not in a good way) was vehemently opposed by doctors all over India, by black bands, marches, burning copies of the bill and when all else failed, even strikes. Many even got arrested during the protests. Yet, it never even made it to the National news. And the bill passed with barely any opposition. So what is it, why doctors are protesting it and is it really that bad?

Let me save you a lot of time - YES! But that is my opinion. Please feel free to form your own opinion. I am attaching a copy of the bill so you can read it yourself if you want,

 [http://164.100.47.4/BillsTexts/LSBillTexts/Asintroduced/185\_2019\_LS\_Eng.pdf](http://164.100.47.4/BillsTexts/LSBillTexts/Asintroduced/185_2019_LS_Eng.pdf) 

Here are some of the points in the bill that I found very disturbing. 

# Legalization of quackery : 

First please understand that under the current system, students after clearing +2 medical undergo MBBS entrance exams through NEET. After clearing one of the most rigorous competitive exams in existence, they study under gruelling circumstances (in govt colleges and a handful of private colleges) for 4.5 years. The exams every year and after passing Final year MBBS, they have to do one more year of very hard training (internship). After that, they have to pass yet another exam called the NEET PG entrance exam to gain admission for MD/MS courses to become a specialist. Since the value of MBBS has greatly decreased, this has become a mainstream process for ost doctors across the country before practicing.

Also note that India has a massive shortage of doctors. According to **WHO, the doctor patient** ratio needs to be **1:1000.** Note that WHO specifies this for government Allopathic doctors. In India this ratio of government allopathic doctors is **1:10,189**. Which means that there is a massive **shortage** of doctors - amost **6 lakh** doctors in the country. This shortage is found in **both urban and rural areas** though the shortage in r**ural areas is more severe.** However, the urban areas are not doing that good either. This is especially when the entire rural population is also seeking healthcare in the urban areas due to **lack of basic facilities and infrastructure** in the rural areas. These deficiencies would not allow for much healthcare provision even if doctors were there.

Also, note that according to WHO standards, India **lacks 2 million nurses** as well. WHO has issued warnings to India regarding its dire state of healthcare and the crisis faced by the people. So the ""brilliant"" (massive sarcasm) solution is this NMC bill was Community Healthcare Providers. We already have a similar system of ANM's that kind of fit the description, so why is this a problem.

The problem lies in the **language of the bill** which is **very vague**.  It states that ""Any person connected to the allopathic heathcare system"" can provide ""primary and preventive healthcare"" ""for a limited period of time""  after a ""6 month training program"". They can work without supervision here. However, under secondary and tertiary hospitals, they will have to work under doctor's suprvision.

Look at the statements in quotes. What does **""any person connected to allopathic healthcare""** mean? Can an ambulance driver get this accredition? Can a ward boy get it? The bill makes no specification. It does not specify the minimum qualification needed for the course. (I could be wrong but I did not find any description). It does not state any experience required or previous job status - nothing.

next it talks about a **6-month training** program. Again, training for what? What courses will be included, What these people will be trained in. How they will be trained. Nothing is specified.

Next it talks about providing **primary healthcare**. From what I understand. Primary healthcare means the treatment one gets at the first point of contact with the healthcare system. Generally, In sane countries where stuff like people's health is important, this means a contact with GP - a general practitioner or physician that can provide basic treatment for basic things. But In a country like India where ""Superpeciality Hospitals"" are the first point of contact for people, the lines between primary and tertiary level healthcare are blurred. **The bill does not define what Primary and Preventive medicine mean**. It is not understood or implied because as I said, anything can be considered primary when given at first point of contact with healthcare. So what treatment can the Community healthcare providers provide? Can they write cardio medications? Can they write pediatric medications? Note that even MBBS students cannot write super specialty treatments or even a head CT to look for brain problems unless under supervision. Even PG students (3 more years after MBBS and internship which makes them a specialist) cannot fiddle with other departments' treatment. And for good reason - the medication and treatment is way more complicated than making a Chandrayan rocket. SO can these people write that? Can they perform operations, which MBBS students cannot do unsupervised? Even PG and beyond need supervision. 

Doctors are strictly regulated when it comes to ultrasound to prevent sex determination and female feticides. (I am not trying to open a debate about whether that is good or bad. Doctors, please focus on the issue at hand) What is the guarantee that these people will not just determine the sex? 

Again, these people are supposed to be practicing in rural areas. There is **no mechanism to make sure** that they will actually **practice in rural areas** and not just peddle pills in urban areas. 

Also, while doctors are bound to write generics and single-dose combinations, there are **zero regulations** in place for these Community Healthcare providers. (CHP) How is this in line with the intention to decrease unregulated indiscriminate use of drugs?

Also, how much time is ""limited period of time""? 3 months, 1 year, 10 years. 100 years? Nothing is specified. Even doctors have to renew their registration every 3 years.

Already people illegally practice allopathy and kill so many people and give them lifelong problems. The govt has claimed to ""stop all quackery"" with this bill. Well yeah, this is one way of doing it. Legalize quackery so there won't be any quacks left. Note that the reports of how well these CHP's do are mostly self-reported and up to now have been for things like uncomplicated delivery and diarrhea. If you talk to doctors they will tell you that in uncomplicated deliveries (which form a large chunk of the deliveries) you have to just catch the baby. The baby and the mother do all the hard work for you. In many cases of bleeding, a simple massage can help stop it. So that is not a very complicated thing to be entrusting to the community. However, comparing that to all primary healthcare is very wrong.

Now, note that doctors are **not opposed** to the idea of community health practitioners **in principle**. Like I said ANM's already exist. However, how the system is set up and managed is the issue. Something more sensible would be welcome. For example. 6-month training program for a nurse with more than 7 years work experience in an MCI approved medical college/hospital specifically to help prevent Acute Encephalitis Syndrome and provide aftercare once the kid has been discharged from the medical college. The appointment should be for 3 years pending renewal and the power to practise should be void outside the specified areas. Add to that some basic management like ORS for diarrhoea, basic hygiene education, women's health education, checking BP, temperature or changing dressings etc (which nurses already do in most hospitals). However, management should be according to doctor's prescription and on any changes immediate referral and contact with the doctor. I don't think many doctors would be opposed to that form of a system. However, this vague wildfire like scenario is extremely scary.

Regarding **no** **supervision** \- why would anyone want to work under supervision when they can work unregulated alone? This will take away nurses etc from the hospitals. As I already mentioned that there is a massive shortage of them, the conditions in hospitals will become even worse as more and more of the nurses (and other professionals or non-professionals) set out to practice legalized quackery. This system should be started after ensuring an increase in the existing personnel, not just redirecting them.

If you want **more rural practitioners**, research has shown that the best way is to **make the system more inclusive** of people born and brought up in rural areas. The medical profession in India is barely in the reach of urban lower middle-class families. Rural population cal only dream of becoming doctors, here in such an exclusive system. But more on that later.

Also, for the people who cite **WHO recommendation for CHP**? - Note that WHO stated this for **very poor countries** that cannot train doctors due to complete lack of funds or war etc. They also stated that this is **highly dependent on the kind of training** received by the workers and care should be taken to ensure proper training for the work. Many countries much much poorer than India have managed a much better healthcare system without the use of these things. In India ( the 7th largest economy set to be a ""5 trillion dollar economy"" (ahem, ahem), what sense does it make to adopt measures for very poor and war-torn countries when we can afford better systems. 

The only sense I can make of it is that it will allow the govt to artificially inflate the numbers on the paper and say that they doubled or trebled the number of ""allopathic"" healthcare providers without having lift a finger. The situation on the ground will not change and might even become worse.

&amp;#x200B;

# 2. The Bridge Course 

The notorious bridge course is back. This allows AYUSH practitioners to practice allopathy after a 6-month ""bridge course"". This is also ridiculous. Note that Ayurveda, Unani, Siddhi and Homeopathy are very different from allopathy. 6 months is not sufficient to learn the materials MBBS doctors find it hard to grasp in 5-8 years. It is hard and a lot of clinical time is required to gain the skills (yes even the meager skills of the doctors these days). That cannot happen in 6 months. This would be like asking a history PhD to build a nuclear reactor. History professor may have a PhD but it is not in physics. similarly, AYUSH is not the same as allopathy. Just as I would not want allopathy people practicing AYUSH. Now, I am not saying Ayurveda is not helpful or good. It is and should be allowed to flourish and thrive (don't get me started on homeopathy. I feel and this is my personal opinion, it is absolute garbage. But to each their own). However, I do believe that these practices should be kept separate and should not be allowed to mix.

AYUSH practitioners practicing allopathy, performing unauthorized surgeries and even running ICU's is a big reason for the poor healthcare, especially critical healthcare in the country.

While we should be investing in training Trauma surgeons, intensivists for better emergency management and taking of the massive work burden off of the specialists so they can focus on OPD's we are legalizing quackery. Training paramedics and issuing proper well-equipped ambulances would be a much better use of resources, help massively in cutting down the number of deaths and even stimulate the automobile industry. But no. 

If we really wanted to eliminate quackery, we would have one national database for registration of doctors. The doctor's name, place of work and registration number would be available for people to see. Anyone could type that in and check whether the doctor is an actual licensd practitioner or not. Would not be that hard. 

However, as was said in the Parliamentary discussion "" **The content of the bill is directly opposed to the stated intent of the bill"".**

# 3. The Very Misunderstood NEXT exam.

A lot of people think that NEXT exam is a good thing and will improve the clinical skills of doctors because that is what the Anti-Health Minister Harshvardhan Sinha stated. However, this is a pure recipe to **destroy all clinical skills** in medicine for good

Understad that currently every single yearly exam for MBBS (1st prof, 2nd prof, 3rd prof and 4th prof) is conducted by the university. The exams consist of theory regarding mostly the most common diseases found, practicals and clinical case discussion. Note that the object of the exam is to reject people unworthy of practicing medicine (I am obviously not including the donation and capitation seats and the completely useless medical colleges)

On the other hand, NEET PG entrance asks about questions that have very less clinical value and often about stuff that is rare and theoretical. The object is to rank students and select a handful out of thousands for future courses. Success is largely dependent on one's ability to take coaching and capacity to memorize MCQ's.

NEXT proposes to merge the two. These two exams are polar opposites of each other. One cannot satisfy both criteria. 

Now, if one says that NEXT will have clinical exams. Then that poses a massive problem for PG entrance. First, it is **nearly impossible to conduct clinical exams** at such a massive scale at the same time. Next, **clinical exams are subjective.** This subjectivity poses massive problems for **PG competition entrance** which should be objective, especially when there can be as many as 200 candidates at the difference of a fraction of a mark in the exam. Note that practical examiners are prone to **biases** and generally being one of the minorities, women, people from lower socioeconomic status, religion or someone not liking your face can cause you to fail because of their **discrimination**. Universities tend to protect agaist this to some degree. However, without any university to intervene, **scandals** in exams will become even more rampant than NEET. 

Note that this exam will be necessary to gain your degree. If an **MBBS student fails** this exam, they will be **equivalent to +2**. The bill makes no mention of how many attempts candidates get for this exam. By the looks of it, students can take this only once. Chances of failing are very high the first time especially when the exam is designed to reject the majority of the people. This will **destroy the careers of students for good**. This is devastating when you consider the amount of time and money spent by students for MBBS. Many students have taken **loans**. This makes no sense when **the difficulty of the exam has nothing to do with what actually it takes to become a good doctor.** Meanwhile, nurses, ward boys and AYush are having a gala time. Note the level of difficulty for MBBS doctors who actually study the required subjects and the ease with which non-MBBS people will have in order to practice the same management.

On the other hand, **if** one says that there will be **no clinical exam**, then this will **decimate the clinical skills of doctors completely**. Already MBBS students are found more in the coaching classes than with patients. Why would anyone go to clinics?

Moreover, note that the **final year MBBS has 6-7 subjects**. While **PG entrance has 19 subjects**. If one says that only final year MBBS subjects will come in the exam, then how does one justify admission into non-final year subjects (MBBS teaches stuff like microbiology in 2nd year. However, PG is gained in microbiology only after clearing PG entrance.) Also, an overall knowledge of all subjects is required to become a good doctor, Preclinical knowledge (non final year subjects) is as important as clinical. This was precisely why just 2 years ago the govt proposed ro make it compulsory to pass (gain at least 50 percentile) in the NEET PG entrance exam to even practice as an MBBS doctor. That kind of a reform would make more sense. ( I am not here to  debate how NEET is not Clean, focus doctors, focus). To take admission in an engineering college one must have studied maths in +2. One does not get admission based on class 9th marks of maths while they have studied History and arts in +2.  Then why is PG entrance allowing for this?

On the other hand, final year degree examination (similar to 10th exam or passing +2 which can be done in any subject) comprises of only final year subjects. So if one follows the PG entrance pattern, how does one justify making someone study ALL the subjects?

The cherry on the cake is that all this has been done **without standardizing the medical syllabus.** So different universities have variations in what they teach. This is what allows some universities to be awesome, like AIIMS and PGI or even the whole state of Tamil Nadu's awesome colleges. But it also allows some colleges to be absolute garbage. However, since the universities have their own exams, the students have to qualify them based on what they learned. If one wants to conduct one exam, it is imperative that the syllabus and the books be standardized. Else it will not be fair. It would be like studying the table of 2 and being asked about the constitution of India. It makes no sense. We have already seen how badly NEET has affected TN and its medical education system. That will be the story for the whole country

[Edit: Moreover, it seems like it eliminates internship. Understand that Medical students need to pass 4th prof to do internship. They do internship and then take NEET as an Exit test to qualify and practice. Internship is the most important thing in the entire career of a doctor to gain clinical skills and get an all-round knowledge of healthcare. That is one year in between the final year and the NEET entrance. However, the bill has combined those two exams one year apart into one and nothing has been mentioned in the bill as to what will happen to the internship.] 

This will promote **coaching culture.** Coaching is the **termite** that has hollowed out the medical system in India. IMO, this poison should be exterminated for good. However, this bill gives it more power. Already if one has not taken coaching in a metropolitan or sub metropolitan city, cannot afford coaching or is rejected by coaching institutes or cannot access them, they have **very low chances** of getting into MBBS or PG entrance (unless you ave backchannels through dalals. But most of them work through coaching institutes anyway). Now, these students **will not even be able to gain a degree**. They will not be able to practice even as MBBS doctors. All the while, CHP can practice medicine after a 6-month course! If your intent is to increase the doctor-patient ratio, how does this make any sense?

# 4. Reservation for the rich

ote that Medical colleges, both for MBBS and PG, have ""regulated and unregulated seats"". Regulated seats are where the fees is regulated by the government. They are affordable for even lower middle income groups. The unregulated seats charge amounts that only the very rich can afford, (no, even upper middle class cannot usually afford it) The Anti health minister claimed that the NMC bill will regulate 50% seats. Sounds great. But it isn't. When you look at the current system, the central government and the state governments together regulate 75-85% of the seats. This is a net **drop from 85% to 50% in the affordable regulated seats.** The increase in unregulated seats has been called reservation for the rich as **universities decrease the minimum marks required for admission to accommodate students that pay more at the expense of more deserving candidates.** Medical education is slowly becoming less and less accessible to the common man. Note that the **less the access of medical education to the common man, the less is the access of healthcare to the common man.**

This is obviously to put more money in the pockets of the politicians and their cronies that own so many medical colleges across the country.

# 5. National Medical Omission Bill

Note that until now, there is a **set method** of maintaining **medical colleges**. There are **strict requirements** to open a medical college, maintain one (keep one open), to increase the available seats for students, etc. It makes sense because medical colleges **treat people and train future doctors**. It is imperative they have proper requirements to do so. For eg, one cannot become a surgeon is there is not an operation theatre (or enough tables in the operating theatre for students to learn on). Until now, this regulation was done by the MCI or the medical council of India.

Yes, the same one. However, recently MCU has been **closing down many medical colleges** across the country , even government colleges, as **the government has not provided appropriate funds to maintain the infrastructure.** I am not even going to start with private medical colleges (not talking about the few awesome ones) While the govt likes to brag about ""creation"" of new seats in medical colleges, they conveniently forget the seats lost due to lack of upkeep of existing medical colleges. Just **last year** about 2000 seats were created and about 3000 seats were lost. There was a **net loss of about 1000 medical seats.** But instead of spending money on the colleges, the govt decided to eliminate the body that shut down incompetent medical colleges. 

Now the colleges **do not need to be inspected. Inspection is optional and can be done after 4 years of the opening of medical college** \- at the time the first medical batch passes. What is to stop you or me from opening a **Trump University** like medical college, charge lakhs of rupees per student per year and then close the college after 3 years and then open another one? Absolutely nothing. This will destroy the careers of thousands of students per year. This will destroy their homes and lives (remember how much money these colleges will charge). Students will pay the fees, join coaching, and study and due to no fault of them, they will be left with no degree. Just like with generics, for medical colleges, there will be **no pragmatic way to tell reliable and unreliable ones apart** (except for a few ones). This is l**egalized conmaship. (420si)** Not to mention the money laundering hubs these paces will become.

Note that the old MCI head was in trouble for taking money to allow some sub-par medical colleges to function. So the solution is to remove ALL regulation from ALL medical colleges. What a cognitive dissonance sir jee.

This truly is the National Medical Omission Bill.

# 6. No more AIIMS, PGI?

Well,techncally they will still exist. You must know that AIIMS, PGI, JIPMER like institutes enjoy a **fairly autonomous status** and the **government** is **not able to interfere** in their working by and large. Correct me if I am wrong, but NMC bill **removes this autonomous status.** This autonomous status plays a great part in making these colleges hubs of learning and research, incredible studies and **institutes of excellence.** This will be a massive blow to their functioning and will reflect in the quality of their care and research. I have no explanation as to why the govt would want to do this.

Another point is that these institutes have PG exams twice a year. However, under NEXT, that will be reduced to once a year. This will cause droppers to lose an entire year instead of months. 

# 7. Replacing MCI with worse.

So we have all heard about the corruption stories of MCI. No one is defending the MCI here. However, this bill does away with the MCI and replaces it with the national Medical commission. This will consist of all government appointees so they will be pretty much like Niti Ayog. What is amazing is that the **medical community gets nearly no representation** in the NMC. Ask yourselves about how much you know about the medical system and how it works (non-medicos obviously). That is exactly how much these people will know. And they are supposed to make decisions about medical education and healthcare. Imagine handing plutonium to a monkey. That would be safer.

Now, there has been many proposals to fix the MCI problem. I liked the one where MCI would be elected and the members would be on partial terms like Rajya Sabha. Their functions would be the same as the old MCI. To control the corruption, one could have ahd oversight by a National Health Comittee with represenation of govt and medical communty; Kind of how it works in Germany. This may not be the best solution but this is one of the scores of solution sthat were better than the NMC.

The state of economy that we see today will be the state of healthcare very soon because it will be managed by similar people.

&amp;#x200B;

# 8. Barely any State Representation

The NMC has a structure where states get rotational representattion. Which means a **state**, especially smaller stated that need more **representation** will get a chance to be on the committee **after as much as 12 years**! After slight dissent from the (non) opposition, this rotation was changed so that states could get representation a little sooner, However, even that is pretty vague. So obviouly state interests are not protected.

&amp;#x200B;

# 9. Too much power

The NMC has too much power. Even **MCI** inspected the colleges and provided guidelines over the medical syllabus, it **did not fix fees, decide new branches** unilaterally **or have complete control over exams**. NMC has all that and more. **The definition of the powers and purpose is so vague that it is meaningless.** They could do anything and it would be binding. 

Moreover,  **the decision of the center in all matters is final.**  so the center could issue a fatwah on anything in complete opposition of the opinion of the entire medical community, all the states, all professions involved (like this bill) and everyone will have to follow it no matter how senseless or harmful. This is total dictatorship and seeing the past few decisions regarding healthcare, will be devastating!

&amp;#x200B;

These are just some of the most important problems I saw at first glance. As I learn more about this. I will keep you posted. I thought everyone should know about these problems as each of these directly affects your healthcare. The politician will fly to USA at taxpayer money for their treatment. We will have to suffer the consequences. If you are outraged by this, please spread the word. Contact the media and ask them to cover this.

My take :

Create Gorkhaland and Bodoland from W.B and Assam respectively.

Make Karbi Anglong and Kukiland a UT.

Divide UP into 6 parts for better administrative efficiency and perhaps make Bundelkhand a UT for speedier development.

https://i.redd.it/dbfff8lv7di31.png

Today marks the second year anniversary of a momentous day in constitutional history in the digital day and age. On August 24, 2017, the Right to Privacy was identified as a fundamental right under the Constitution of India by a nine judge bench of the Supreme Court. The declaration of privacy as a right has had manifold impact not only affecting direct issues of data protection but even larger areas of mass surveillance and personal aspect such as the right to one's own sexuality.

The Right to Privacy is very close to our hearts, it has been one of IFF's core issues and we have consistently been working to ensure the same for citizens of India.  Our fight for privacy has persisted since the introduction of the Draft Personal Data Protection Bill, 2018 with submissions to public consultations, RTIs requesting transparency and disclosure, advocating for privacy through intrusive government schemes such as CCTVs and facial recognition systems and most recently, the tabling of the Personal Data and Information Privacy Code, 2019 in the Lok Sabha aided by the wonderful Dr. Ravi Kumar (Lok Sabha, MP from Tamil Nadu). This is only the beginning.

We will work with all institutions of governance and also continue to challenge them to do better, to continue to work towards ensuring an individual's right to privacy is put first and foremost.

In light of this journey as country, IFF due to the partnership and support of Mozilla will celebrate today with an event that will feature talks and a conversation with Justice B.N. Srikrishna. This will be to the benefit to a cross section of stakeholders and we hope bring varied perspectives such as on gender and criminal justice that are an integral parcel of privacy right. Since seating and space has been limited we are video recording this event and will post it online soon.

We are also encouraging a wider community today to mark, celebrate on what privacy means to them by posting on social media. We have created a document with a few tweets on privacy [at this link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iYlIC7Pv8TxkIm3tKXv1DqyHvSWPsMVf-OcQRJydb7s/edit?usp=sharing) for you tweet out personally. If you feel like it please do consider tagging it with #PrivacySupreme.

Thank you!

If you support the Right to Privacy, help us support you. [***Become an IFF member today***](https://internetfreedom.in/donate/)***!***",cuqjw9,,false,/r/india/comments/cuqjw9/privacysupreme_two_years_of_the_right_to_privacy/,Policy/Economy

I do not have a complete understanding of Indian tax system. One purpose of this post is for me to learn.

That being said, from what ever I have read, news papers, online forum etc, it seems like proportion of indirect tax, ie, consumption tax, is higher than direct tax and corporate tax compared to OECD countries. This is my perception. May not be true. At the same time, business owners are hounded by the tax authorities.

Two things stands out to me in this regard -

1. Although every one I know feels like they are over taxed, Indian welfare benefits are not at all generous. Public health benefits are substandard. So are government run K-12 schools and most of public colleges and universities. Good quality public goods like parks, libraries are scarce. Public infrastructure is also not something to be proud of. Number of government employees per capita is lower than most of the developed countries. 

We are also not running budget surpluses. Then where does the taxed money go?

2. Greater burden on consumption tax implies greater burden on people who consume bigger portion of their income. Which makes it regressive. What is the justification for this structure?

https://i.redd.it/r1u801m8uye31.png

On 30.07.2019, media reports and various user complaints brought to light an issue that caused the automatic registration of unified payments interface (UPI) based IDs of Truecaller users without their knowledge and consent. We wrote to NPCI indicating concern and suggesting immediate and intermediate action ([**read more**](https://internetfreedom.in/true-caller-or-false-caller-we-ask-ncpi-to-answer-this-question/)).

NPCI wrote back to us in less than 48 hours agreeing with the contents of our representation. It also indicated two specific steps. *First* it had stopped on boarding new Truecaller users on the UPI Platform. *Second* the matter is under investigation and we will be informed after diligence is completed in all matters. We will keep urging for public disclosure that will have multiple benefits. It will help inform impacted users, improve processes in technology companies and further greater trust in the UPI ecosystem.

But also, let us step back for a moment. This is not only about Truecaller. It is about user consent more widely. The privacy, safety and security of users of the UPI interface. While for a complete remedy we need a data protection law (*which India does not have yet*) that is user centric *(*[***like the Indian Privacy Code***](https://saveourprivacy.in/principles)); we appreciate and commend the actions being taken by NPCI within its mandate and urge it do more.

Limited to the UPI ecosystem, in our representation we made three specific suggestions on the basis of inputs and tweets from Srikanth Lakshmanan (@logic), Anand Venkatanarayanan ([**@iam\_anandv**](https://twitter.com/iam_anandv)), Srinivas Kodali ([**@digitaldutta**](https://twitter.com/digitaldutta)) and Abhay Rana ([**@captn3m0**](https://twitter.com/captn3m0)). We continue to urge the NPCI to walk towards them and are hopeful that our wide community of supporters encourage them to do so as well.

Are there any news on this?

1. Passport is not meant to be address proof
2. Most people move in a span of 10 years and address on passport is not current address for them. This ends up as multiple verifications over many addresses.
3. Police verification usually asking of bribing, intentional delays. They can instead verify from court and criminal records.

https://i.redd.it/5re8uegffeg31.png

Hello beloved community members,

We have some exciting news! We were just thinking to ourselves that we don't do enough community events. But with perfect timing, HasGeek reached out to us to be a community partner for a talk on Net Neutrality by the brilliant Dr. Vishal Misra, Professor at Columbia University.

Dr. Misra began looking at Net Neutrality from an engineering and networking perspective a few years ago. At this talk, he will touch upon issues such as the prediction back in 2008 about rise in paid peering and the negative impact of differential pricing on competition to name a few.

Piqued your interest? We thought as much. Head on over to HasGeek house, Indiranagar at 11:00am on August 15th. As you make your way to the event, make sure to meet our super cool trustees, Karthik Balakrishnan and Rachita Taneja, to get some IFF merch. So what are you waiting for? Hurry up and [RSVP at this link!](https://hasgeek.com/fifthelephant/2019-public-lecture-by-vishal-misra/)

Given it is Independence Day tomorrow, we hope you take this national holiday as an opportunity to look into your digital wallets and channel some funds towards protection of digital rights. We've made it as seamless as possible with a special page on Razorpay for your generous donations (link at the bottom). In the spirit of optimism and as we as celebrate India's Independence, we hope to raise close to Rs. 1.5 lakh through the support of our community.

Of course, if you can't donate yourself, please do ask your family and friends!  
1 share = 1 prayer for protection against the ""all-seeing eye of surveillance""  
We joke we joke, we kid we kid! Not about the need for greater support in protecting fundamental rights in the digital sphere though.

No amount is too small! We appreciate your generosity and will continue to do everything we can to protects your digital rights.

https://i.redd.it/j4p04f4ojlh31.png

**August 20, 2019:** A few weeks back, IFF intervened in an ongoing public interest litigation filed with the Madras High Court had permitted IFF regarding linking of Aadhaar with social media accounts, as we explained in [**our previous post**](https://internetfreedom.in/vanakkam-updates-on-the-aadhaar-social-media-linkage-and-encryption-pil-before-the-madras-hc/). This case has gained such importance due to the spectrum of issues no longer limited to Aadhaar and social media linking and also brought within its ambit big companies such as Facebook, Whatsapp, Google etc.

On August 13, the Supreme Court of India proceeded to hear a petition put forth by Facebook to transfer the case pending before the Madras High Court to the Apex court. The matter was adjourned, to be heard on August 19 which was pushed once again to August 20 with continuing suspense of whether the case would be transferred, keeping everyone on edge especially with the next hearing in the Madras High Court scheduled for August 21.

Today, the case was listed as Item No. 13 in Court No. 13 before the division bench of Supreme Court with Hon'ble Justice Deepak Gupta and Hon'ble Justice Aniruddha Bose in a hearing that continued for over 45 minutes. Arguments made were not purely limited to the transfer prayed by Facebook but also included substantial arguments on the encryption and the linking of Aadhaar. However, the judges made it clear that at this stage the Court was only concerned with whether the petitions should be transferred and not with substantive merits of these cases. The Hon'ble Court agreed to examine these aspects as it issued notice to the respondents in the petition. While it did not restrain the Madras High Court from continuing hearings, it did direct that it shall not give any final orders. The next date for hearing before the Supreme Court is September 13, 2019.

Arguments were made by Senior Advocates Mukul Rohatgi for Facebook, Kapil Sibal for WhatsApp and the former Attorney General of India K.K. Venugopal representing the State of Tamil Nadu. Issues of the existence of cross purposes in the relief claimed by cases in the Madras HC and the Supreme Court, the magnitude of the impact of this case on global products such as Whatsapp, even examples of the Blue Whale challenge as a justification to identification of originators were voiced.

The next scheduled date for hearing in the Madras High Court is August 21, for which IFF will be present. We have also prepared submissions to Kamakoti's response which will be submitted to the court. As always, we will continue to update you with the happenings of the case while sipping the best filter coffee.",csxv5u,,false,/r/india/comments/csxv5u/updates_from_the_supreme_court_facebooks_transfer/,Policy/Economy

Access to the  internet is a human right. Massive economic, social and individual harm  caused when it is disrupted. But the human costs are much deeper.  Cutting off Internet access prevents people from using the Internet to  reach out for help, and makes them panic. They cannot make sure their  loved ones are safe, or practice their right to expression and political  participation - the government cannot unreasonably deny anyone in this  country this right. We believe that internet based communications play a  vital role in promoting greater trust between people and their  government.

Arguments on security and public safety which are  often made have resulted in a situation where India has the highest  number of internet shutdowns globally. Most of these happen in Jammu and  Kashmir. As per SFLC’s internet shutdown [tracker](https://internetshutdowns.in/)  this is the 51st time (atleast) this year that Kashmir has faced an  internet shutdown and it won’t be the last until there is a serious  reform on shutdown laws.

We have through our work consistently  over months highlighted how it results in harm to different parts of  India. From Rajasthan, West Bengal, Maharashtra. But tonight, we are  concerned about Jammu and Kashmir. People there who are suffering from  anxiety and bewilderment due to a deprivation of internet and mobile  communication services. We are concerned for their safety, physical and  mental care. 

The last few days has underscored the need for legal  reform given that as per our understanding the existing law under which  orders for internet disruptions are passed undermine our fundamental  rights. **IFF urges the government to stop these arbitrary shutdowns that lack any sort of structure or oversight.**

Jammu and Kashmir and all of India deserves better. These are our constitutional promises which must be fulfilled.

1565075562,billionaireinindia,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cmndkk/rant_criminalization_of_csr_is_another_pain_for/,29,61,,,[Rant] Criminalization of CSR is another pain for companies,"This is another sort of rant about a bad policy by the government. Id first like to clear something up. I’m NOT against mandatory  CSR. I personally don’t like the very idea of mandatory CSR but since it’s law, our company fully complies with all CSR requirements. It’s just the way the government is amending it to make non compliance a criminal offense that is problematic. Let me explain: 

When a corporation is profitable, it pays corporate tax. On top of that, it generates jobs and wealth for individuals and provides valuable goods and services. This boosts the economy. When companies do CSR, they are essentially doing social service and there is nothing wrong in that. 

The problem is why the bloody hell does the government want to criminalize it? I know that non compliance is an issue but this just makes it an additional headache for companies. The compliance officer may not have the same view of CSR as companies do and will eventually end up harassing us. Since there is no concrete framework for CSR i.e. what is and what isn’t CSR, it is largely open to interpretation. And if the government puts another bureaucrat they’ll have absolutely no idea on CSR. 

In fact, I don’t even understand why the government is doing this. The last time I checked, CSR compliance is at 91.25%. There are certain policies (such as the tax on the super rich) which is vote bank politics but this effectively starts an ‘inspector raj’ all over again. 

And if companies have left over money for CSR, we have to deposit in an escrow account after 3 years?! We are not criminals. We WILL eventually use that money. The government is literally putting its hand in our pockets! This is a sad state of affairs. We aspire to be a 5 trillion dollar economy. The government wants ‘animal spirit’. And the ease of doing business here is being dragged down.",cmndkk,,false,/r/india/comments/cmndkk/rant_criminalization_of_csr_is_another_pain_for/,Policy/Economy

Since economy works with buy-sell of products and services, current slowdown can be attributed to 

A. Cash crunch in hands of citizens. (I mean income, not currency notes)

B. Oversupply of pricey products.

C. Lowered consumer sentiment.

Etc etc... You must have got my point by now...


Since GST and demonetization, money from parallel market is invested (cough! Real estate! Cough! Gold!) And any bulk sale of these asset will raise suspicion.

Thus it's slowdown.

And since people are waiting for things to be rosy again, they are willing to wait for luxuries.

Now comes BMI. 

IF govt decides to push money to poor households...

Purchasing power of poor will multiply manyfolds.

And assuming, they will go buying...

Economy might revert back to health.

Basis for my understanding: was talking to a prof of commerce. Was talking about  current slowdown. When he pointed towards 2008 depression and MNREGA. He explained about the bottom byuoncy which kept local economy in good health despite external flu. This enrichment of lower strata of society with cash flow kept demand high thus subverting depression and subsequent rejuvenation of economy when depression subsided in world economy.

Since MNREGA is still available, on this he told... Economy has now equilibrated with  effect of MNREGA. 

His view about recent spurt of economic activity in Kashmir was favourable.

[Uber reports biggest loss ever of $5.2 billion in Q2 as growth falls](https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/uber-reports-biggest-loss-ever-52-billion-q2-growth-falls-106944)

- RESTAURANTS ARE CLOSING DOWN, BUT FOOD DELIVERY SERVICES ARE GOING UP.

[Zomato posts $294 million loss for FY19](https://www.businesstoday.in/top-story/zomato-posts-294-million-loss-for-fy19-revenue-up-3-fold-to-206-million/story/334528.html)

(Though I wonder what is Swiggy and Zomato going to deliver if the restaurants close down, padosi ke ghar se khaana deliver karenge kya??)


- DEMAND IS DOWN, BUT CONSUMPTION IS UP.

1567139414,jawaharlawl,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cxc1wp/two_ideas_1_neutrality_index_ni_an_indicator_for/,2,7,,,"Two Ideas: (1) Neutrality Index (NI), an Indicator for News Houses &amp; (2) Blockchain Voting System - A Protocol to Ensure Tamperproof Voting","**Neutrality Index (NI)**

We have always heard of TV channels getting TRPs. In general, the more the TRP, the better.

But why should we have TRPs for news channels? Is including a TRP index for news channels or houses justifiable? **A news house's objective is to host a platform for unbiased news; not to gather view count. Why not leave TRPs for entertainment channels?**

 Why can't we have a separate index for news and similar mediums?

**Neutrality Index**: Having a Neutrality Index (NI) could significantly help stop the propagation of biased selective news. However, the very first step in doing so is by taking TRP ratings off these news channels.

Today, the essential core objective of most Indian news houses is NOT to show news, but it's rather to show propaganda and that can be clearly seen by the pressure of the ruling government. NI is a way to break that link. With NI, the news house is bound by a constraint, and that is to keep up with its neutrality.

**How will NI be calculated?**

We very well know that in our country voting has become more or less of a joke. That said, using a voting system is probably not the right choice. Let me suggest having an independent body that has absolutely no relation or inclination, with politics. What can be one? Maybe an internationally well-known agency that has been doing such work for several decades. Maybe something else? This is still a work in progress.

**Blockchain Voting System - A Protocol to Ensure Tamperproof Voting**

On a side note, I would also love to hear your thoughts on how can we tackle the problem of EVM and vote manipulation in the country? We've seen it happen in India and recently in the US too. So it is very well possible and in no way can we dismiss the fact that vote manipulation did happen in the last general election.

Problem: **EVM vote manipulation and repeated voting for the same person**

A possible way to tackle it? **Blockchain**.

In simple terms, a blockchain is a kind of data structure (kind of a tree) that is made up of blocks (duh?) and uses a hash function to ensure the integrity of the entire blockchain. In other words, it cannot be tampered with. If tampered, all the next blocks will carry the footprint of the block where the tampering originated.

We can use a blockchain voting system, paired with a unique identifier for each individual voter (Aadhar, for instance). A receipt of the vote will be directly sent to the voter (on phone, printed, etc.) and the voter can rest assured that nobody will be able to tamper with it.

I won't go into the entire systems design but the system is highly scalable and efficient.

Guess what, there are multiple blockchain projects for implementing such a system already on github (repository for hosting IT projects) and West Virginia is already in the plans to adopt it.

Apart from that khoya is used for making halwa and  icecream too. In India everyone loves sweets thus we can find a sweet  shop in any small street. In order to make pure sweet khoya is a must  have item which is made after boiling the milk. Still Confectioner use  hands to make khoya but there are machines that can make khoya on a big  scale. If you have enough money to invest in somewhere then I am here to  tell you how to start a khoya making business with a single khoya  machine and you can fulfill the demand of your city.

**Marketing Survey for Khoya Business**

It is essential to do market survey before starting khoya business in your area.

=&gt; How much khoya demand is there in market?

=&gt; Where you can sell khoya after making it?

=&gt; How many sweet shops are there around your area?

=&gt; How much khoya these sweet shops use daily?

=&gt; How many suppliers of khoya are there in the market?

You  can contact all the shops in the 5 kilometer range around you who use  the khoya. Find out about the quality and Quantity of them. This will  give you an idea of what kind of a plan you want to make?

There  are many types of khoya in market. Nowadays, khoya that is supplied is  not of good quality make the shopkeeper trust you that you will provide  the purest quality of khoya to attract him.

**Raw Materials Needed for Making Khoya**

Only  Milk is needed to make khoya. The Quality of khoya depends on the  quality of milk. 1 KG of milk contact 8% Fat and gives your around 400  to 500 gm khoya. 6% fat gives 300 gm fat

**From where to purchase Raw Material?**

For  huge Quantity of milk you can contact the village nearest to you. You  can also contact any nearest dairy to you. You can also use packaged  milk but that will prove costly to you and less profit. You can also use  full cream milk to make khoya that can give a better quality of khoya.

**Cost of Raw Materials**

The  price of milk is different everywhere, yet buffalo milk can be found  between ₹ 50 ₹ 60 kg and cow's milk can be found between 40 to 50 years.  Packet milk is also found in these prices. If the cow or buffalo's milk  does not get milk, then this business can be started with packet milk.

**Space Needed to Start Khoya Business**

To  start this business, about 450 square feet is needed. 5 × 5 is enough  for the machine, but a place to store milk is also needed. Apart from  being lost then a place should also be needed to keep it. You can start  this work by replacing 10 × 10 Square Fit in the beginning. After that  as you grow your business you can take more space.

There  are lots of variables available for the khoya machine in the market  such as stainless steel, iron and mix. You can choose the machine  according to your budget.

**Khoya Machine Price**

The  cost of a Khoya machine depends on its capability. But if you take 150  liters of capacity, then you can buy between 40,000 and 95,000. Standard  steel and iron are used to make the machine. The price of the machine  depends on which grade of steel or iron is being used in the machine.  You can customize it according to your budget and needs.

In addition to this machine, to store the Khoya, a deep freezer will be needed and the gas cylinder is needed to heat the milk.

There  are two burners in this machine. You can use gas or diesel to heat the  milk. If both systems are kept in this machine then you can use it as  cheap and convenient as you think. Electricity is required to run the  machine. You can run it from the single-phase electric used at home.

**How much khoya can be made with 150 liters of milk?**

I have a few freelancers working on the project remotely while I take care of support. The team in place is quite sufficient and does not require a physical office space.

Given my situation and desire to take this beyond my city how easy it is to setup this company?

* Should I register it as a ""Sole Proprietorship"" firm or are there better options?
* Can I use my permanent residential address to register the business? 
* Can I sell the product without any tax?

I have cut down on any spendings other than the grocery, fuel and bills. 

Please let me know if anyone has been in the same situation before and got out. What should I do? Borrow this amount from someone and pay off? Also, if I can't borrow from any person, what are my options?

**Hypothetical example**:  
I am a founder of a well known IT company in India which is staring down the bankruptcy barrel. My company is a publicly listed company.Would I as a founder, be held personally liable for any outstanding debt owed by the company?

Bankruptcy laws in other capitalist countries make it clear, that under normal circumstances the founder CANNOT BE held liable for any company related debt.

Does the same apply as per the IBC code? If so, could someone please share official links?

What do a planned US$15 billion Saudi investment in petroleum-related Indian businesses and a controversial boxing championship have in common?



Both reflect a world in which power and economics drive policy, politics and business at the expense of fundamental rights.



And both underscore an emerging new world order in which might is right, a jungle in which dissenters, minorities and all other others are increasingly cornered and repressed.



Rather than furthering stability by building inclusive, cohesive societies both support trends likely to produce an evermore unstable and insecure world marked by societal strife, mass migration, radicalization and violence.



A world in which business capitalizes on decisions by a critical mass of world leaders who share autocratic, authoritarian and illiberal principles of governance and often reward each other with lucrative business deals for policies that potentially aggravate rather than reduce conflict.



No doubt, the planned acquisition by Saudi Arabia’s state-owned national oil company Aramco of 20 percent of the petroleum-related businesses of Reliance Industries, one of India’s biggest companies, makes commercial and strategic economic and business sense.



Yet, there is equally little doubt that the announcement of the acquisition will be read by Indian prime minister Narendra Modi, days after he scrapped the autonomous status of the troubled, majority Muslim region of Kashmir, as a license to pursue his Hindu nationalist policies that discriminate against Muslims and other minorities and fuel tensions with Pakistan, the subcontinent’s other nuclear power.



The ultimate cost of the fallout of policies and business deals that contribute or give license to exclusion rather than inclusion of all segments of a population and aggravate regional conflict could be far higher than the benefits accrued by the parties to a deal.



Underscoring the risk of exclusionary policies and unilateral moves, cross border skirmishes between Indian and Pakistani forces erupted this week along the Kashmiri frontier in which at least five people were killed.



The timing of the announcement of the Aramco Reliance deal in a global environment in which various forms of racism and prejudice, including Islamophobia, are on the rise, assures Indian political and business leaders that they are unlikely to pay an immediate price for policies that sow discord and risk loss of life.



Like in the case of Saudi and Muslim acquiescence in China’s brutal clampdown on Turkic Muslims in the troubled, north-western Chinese province of Xinjiang, the most frontal assault on a faith in recent history, the announcement risks convincing embattled Muslim minorities like the Uighurs, the Kashmiris or Myanmar’s Rohingya who are lingering in refugee camps in Bangladesh that they are being hung out to dry.



To be sure, Kashmiris can count on the support of Pakistan but that is likely to be little more than emotional, verbal and political.



Pakistan is unlikely to risk blacklisting by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an international anti-money laundering and terrorism finance watchdog, at its next scheduled meeting in October by unleashing its anti-Indian militants.



Anthony Joshua’s controversial fight with Andy Ruiz scheduled for December in Saudi Arabia, the first boxing championship to be held in the Middle East, pales in terms of its geopolitical or societal impact compared to the Saudi Indian business deal.



Fact is that Saudi Arabia’s hosting of the championship has provoked the ire of activists rather than significant population groups. The fight is furthermore likely to be seen as evidence and a strengthening of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s selective efforts to socially liberalize the once austere kingdom.



Nonetheless, it also reinforces Prince Mohammed’s justified perception that Saudi Arabia can get away with imprisoning activists who argued in favour of his reforms as well as the lack of transparency on judicial proceedings against the alleged perpetrators of the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Saudi Arabia insists the killing was perpetrated by rogue operatives.



What Saudi investment in India and the scheduled boxing championship in the kingdom have in common is that both confirm the norms of a world in which ‘humane authority,’ a concept developed by prominent Chinese international relations scholar Yan Xuetong, is a rare quantity.



Mr. Yan employs the concept to argue without referring to President Xi Jinping, Xinjiang, China’s aggressive approach towards the South China Sea or its policy towards Taiwan and Hong Kong that China lacks the humane authority to capitalize on US President Donald J. Trump’s undermining of US leadership.



Mr. Yan defines a state that has humane authority as maintaining strategic credibility and defending the international order by becoming an example through adherence to international norms, rewarding states that live up to those norms and punishing states that violate them. Garnering humane authority enables a state to win allies and build a stable international order.



Mr. Yan’s analysis is as applicable to India and Saudi Arabia as it is to China and others that tend towards civilizational policies like the United States, Russia, Hungary and Turkey.



It is equally true for men like Anthony Joshua promoter Eddie Hearn and business leaders in general.



To be sure, Aramco is state-owned and subject to government policy. Nonetheless, as it prepares for what is likely to be the world’s largest initial public offering, even Aramco has to take factors beyond pure economic and financial criteria into account.



At the end of the day, the consequence of Mr. Yan’s theory is that leadership, whether geopolitical, economic or business, is defined as much by power and opportunity as it is by degrees of morality and ethics.



Failure to embrace some notion of humane authority and reducing leadership and business decisions to exploiting opportunity with disregard for consequences or the environment in which they are taken is likely to ultimately haunt political and business leaders alike.



Said Mr. Yan: “Since the leadership of a humane authority is able to rectify those states that disturb the international order, the order based on its leadership can durably be maintained.”

What is true for political leaders is also true for business leaders even if they refuse to acknowledge that their decisions have as much political as economic impact.

This year, understanding the need of promoting water  conservation, rainwater harvesting and plantation, Fiinovation through  its CSR-CSO Partnership practice assisted Uflex and Aroh Foundation in  implementation of CSR initiatives in the national capital region. The  project will be carried out for the next three years where the capacity  of the local communities will be build to conserve and optimize the  natural resource base.

The project is being funded by Uflex which is one of the largest  flexible packaging company in India. Aroh Foundation is engaged in  implementation of the project and have been chosen for the same after  thorough scrutiny of credibility and previous experience of similar  projects.

The Uflex project is being implemented in two villages of Gautam  Budhha Nagar and is estimated to benefit more than 400 farmers. The  project will involve construction of in-situ and ex-situ rainwater  harvesting structures to address the water scarcity concerns of the  people. Aroh Foundation is known for their work in the social  development and environment restoration and will help the farmers build  field bunds and farm ponds to arrest rain water. The project will also  include organic and inorganic mulching to protect the degrading top soil  and plantation drive.

Other aspect of the project is the horticulture production which  shall be grown in the community and individually owned land. The  specific activities will be beneficial for the livestock also due to  availability of fodder all year round in the implementation area. The  farmers will also benefit from the plants bearing fruits.

[Fiinovation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxro9bso574)  expects that the project will increase the ground water levels due to  increased percolation and therefore, there will be better availability  of water for domestic and agricultural use. There are plans for  implementation of similar water conservation projects across India,  especially the drought hit regions. Today, such initiatives are not only  beneficial for the farmers but has become a necessity. It is inspiring  to see corporations such as Uflex investing their CSR funds towards  environment conservation and sustainable development.

Let us hope that through the water conservation projects, India will  be able to resolve the water crisis in  future. Fiinovation urge  corporations to focus on partnerships for implementation of similar CSR  initiatives.",cuby2w,,false,/r/india/comments/cuby2w/fiinovation_assisting_corporations_and_ngos_in/,Business/Finance

I've regularly seen Indian media sites like Zee News and others post warnings about impending earthquakes every few months. I believe this spread of pseudoscience must be limited as it leads to unnecessary panic in the minds  of  people who don't know how earthquakes occur. It is not yet possible to predict earthquakes days in advance and the best technology can give a warning a few seconds before the tremor starts. Each day there are thousands of earthquakes  with most being of extremely low magnitude,  [https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/map/](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/map/)  I believe an awareness program should be started to educate people about earthquakes, their causes,effects and safety measures during such events. In place of that we have large media companies posting nonsense about linking of seismic events with cosmic mumbo-jumbo. They should focus on education like  [https://earthquake.usgs.gov/learn/kids/eqscience.php](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/learn/kids/eqscience.php)  .

Our education system is so flawed that I know people who've studied in top schools and universities that too with civil engineering who believe that slaughter of animals causes the release of pain waves which lead to catastrophic events like earthquakes.

**Redmi Note 7 Pro:** 4+64: 14k | 6+64: 15k | 6+128: 17k

**My use:** A couple of messaging apps, a social media app, e-mails, light web browsing, sometimes Kindle app, a lot of music, some video playback, a few other apps. No gaming.

**My top priority question:** Considering advancement in Android (memory footprint of newer apps, power/RAM-management features of newer Android versions), is 4 GB RAM enough in this era?

**Other things to consider:**

* Camera: Undecided - I don't take many pics but it is important. AFAIK both have the same sensor but how is post-processing? I do not care about selfies.
* Audio: Realme X - I saw that Realme has Dolby Atmos so kinda leaning towards it
* Screen: Realme X - I have never used anything with a notch so far so I'm not sure how I'm going to feel about notch of RN7P.
* Battery: Realme X - RN7P has a bigger battery but RX has a fast charger in-box.
* SoC: I don't care as long as it gives fluid experience.
* \*add something if there is anything else to consider\*

So in the end, I am stuck because of the camera and the topic of memory requirement/management. Help me with it!

Did I pick the correct device in the rest of the categories?

Considering Vivo Z1 Pro on the side. It has a much bigger battery with 18 W charger &amp; a newer SoC. However, I cannot stand micro-USB &amp; I'm unsure about its camera from various reviews. But let me know if you think its pros outweigh the effing micro-USB (I don't know why I hate it!!).

Or is there any upcoming phone within my price range (around 15k)?

I was very interested in upcoming Mi A3 but 720p AMOLED is painful. I had smaller AMOLED screens and over 5 inches it was okay at best. 6 inches is meh.

I have checked several Samsung phones, and I have decided against them for various reasons (VFM, past experience). Still, if you have a strong recommendation for a Samsung phone let me know.

1566490198,throwaway93681,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ctzkd1/rant_im_seriously_tired_of_this_is_so_called/,6,16,,,[Rant] I'm seriously tired of this is so called education,"This is mostly your weekly education rant, nothing new. Throwaway account since I'd like to stay anonymous and wanted to let my thoughts out in the open.

A bit about me first. I loved computers from a pretty young age but at the time I simply loved it as a hobby. I also remember the young me reading tons of books on topics like space and nature. The only thing I was good at my middle school was Physics and Computer Science but kinda ignored all the other subjects. I also loved helping other students with these subjects to the extent teachers would point out to me with ""stop being so noisy"" and ""get back to your seat"" kind of synonyms. I was pretty open to the future wondering what it held for me. Anyway, I decided to pick up Engineering.

Everything has been going in a downward spiral since then. As any typical kid in India trying to get into a good Engineering college, I went to these so called JEE coaching classes. These places were so horrible. Over time, I realised that these coaching classes are simply forcing down material onto their students. If there was some actual learning happening in there, given the vast syllabus, it wouldn't be so surprising whenever a high school kid from India marked an innovation in science. Rather we see students killing themselves for not being able to score good marks in the examination. There is such an intense pressure on kids since you're constantly being told that not making into a good college equates to no woman marrying you and you're going to be working an awful job, if not jobless. In short, your life is going to become so fucked up that we see kids already making peace with death instead. And then out there are some fucking assholes who feel that this is helping in reducing the population of our country by weeding out the unworthy. Just stop making kids at the rate you shit, fuckheads. Instead of making a positive effect in the country, these coaching centres asking for a shitload of money are simply saturating the already saturated field of Engineering in India. Some parents also force their kids to these coaching centres just because of their faculty flaunting their achievements as if they are a God's gift to this world. Anyway, these coaching centres are just a symptom of the core problem of how most reputed colleges in India accept students solely on the basis of one or two examinations and how colleges like to be seduced into being an AICTE approved college. This whole education thing has turned into fucking business.

I failed my JEE since I couldn't keep up. The failure doesn't hurt me, partially because it is my way of rejecting this system. I've come to a realisation that I cannot learn things solely by books and paper, I need to experience it in reality, or I cannot digest anything. Which is why I was probably good in and loved Physics and Computer Science. It costs virtually nothing to see things in motion and see that the equations really do match up, and write computer programs to do stuff for you and everything makes sense. The thing is that doing everything in such a way consumes a lot of time, but I feel it is worth it. It's extremely hard to work on all the high school concepts here and look out for their real world significance at the same time, all when the examinations are pretty much all formulae and rote based.

Anyway, I joined a tier-3 college hoping to at least make it nice in Computer Science since all you need is a Computer to experience anything. But oh lord fuck this place. Just so you know, I spent my high school years learning to program by writing small scripts to manipulate my environment and eventually, I started working with other people to make open-source software. So all this helped me get into GSoC in my very first year of college and worked with some genuine people working hard to make a positive impact to this world. If not for GSoC, I'd also have been forced to attend the ""summer training"" to ""learn HTML &amp; CSS"" along with other students in the college itself, where the students are kept idle for like half the session and you know what all restrictions they put on even when you are idle - no phones, no YouTube, no heads down for taking a break, no talking to other students (seriously?!). I had another friend of mine who did GSoC in the 2nd year but you know what, students were supposed to ""attend a training institute"" by paying the institute money during this summer break but apparently his GSoC wasn't considered since it was seen as an online course (as opposed to going and attending a training institute) by our Head of Department. So, rejected. Poor guy still had to pay a private institute for his forged training certificate despite of working so hard and lie that he worked on both his training and his GSoC project.

I'll talk about some more wonders here. Our college has so called Soft Skills sessions where instead of learning how to communicate properly with other people, you are simply taught how to flaunt and bluff every little thing to everyone and speak hollow words to ""impress"" other people (since in the end, this college only cares about to headline the highest number of placements offered in the Limca Book of Records). Rather than receiving proper technical knowledge, we spend time practising aptitude questions. Many students here have difficulty communicating, structuring grammar and forming sentences in simple English due to their unfortunate backgrounds and yet no work is ever done to help those students become proficient. It's been 3 semesters since we've been studying about Software Engineering and Software Testing to learn the craft of creating and maintain a software, and literally not a single fucking line of code yet! Most students still believe all that there is to testing a software is looking for bugs by hand. There hasn't even been a mention of automated tests and sort till date and I am 3 years in. And, if the authorities find any students good in solving aptitude questions, they are going to differentiate them by making them solve CodeChef problems in extra classes as if remaining students are merely a possession to the college for the time.

We are assigned to work on a team project every semester and are evaluated by professors who have no experience in the said technology the project is based on. These professors then end up judging students by asking standardised definitions from the desired technology in the final viva instead of actually evaluating by asking project specific questions. No wonder the majority of students steal from GitHub or copy-paste projects from their peers, no one cares. Also, the assignment questions are so blunt with hardly any thinking involved, you can look them up and boom you get full marks if you submitted it on time. Now, I could keep listing whatever the hell is wrong here: Minimum attendance: 75% or no exams for you. Students are forced to stay seated and their heads up even if the concerned subject teacher is on leave and the substitute teacher has nothing to teach about. Internet/WiFi is censored by some company called FortiGuard, anyway the Internet hardly works here. Can't eat, roam or leave the campus before 12 noon. Worst of all, there are students who have been so brainwashed that they blindly trust the authorities just because they believe the faculty is truly full of professionals and are the ones who can help them get a job if they keep repeating their words. We aren't really learning anything here of actual use.

I don't even know whether this is the situation for most colleges in India or I just happen to be in one.

Now here is me who helps with some really nice open-source projects, writes technical posts trying my best not to repeat what the Internet already knows, fighting censorship, trying to help my peers and random internet people with anything technical whenever possible, just because I like to care about people.  All this when college eats up my 9+ hours (including commute) everyday, I really feel like a fucking idiot now. What am I even doing. I don't even want to bother with money or be a rich man, just enough to feed myself or if a family happens someday. This shit has been so sickening lately that I've started doubting that it's just me who the real asshole here is.",ctzkd1,,false,/r/india/comments/ctzkd1/rant_im_seriously_tired_of_this_is_so_called/,Science/Technology

Just a day before the whole debacle, it seemed the protests and critique of the government was certainly picking up major velocity in not just internet circles like this sub but also mass media. And then they announce this and it's almost like everyone forgot in one day the reality of rape culture that persisits and even grows as per some records, in our country. They effectively dodged quite a bullet and a lot of bad PR in one fell swooop.

I would like to believe that this is mere co incedence but the teachings of Edward Bernays would say otherwise. The current party in power has a track record of using such techniques and methods and are even credited with popularising this sort of campaigning after the last elections, including using many modern day tools and technologies to further enhance the impact and effectiveness of these methods, such as those, but not limited too,  that have been recently brought to the public eye in the documentary ""The Great Hack"". The expeneses of the party also reveal a major chunk of their finances being used with respect to PR politics and it's methods and techniques. There are also strong allegations and reports of them heavily influencing and interfering with the media, that seem to be systematically being silenced in the most suspicious of circumstances more often than not by unknown characters. There are also strong links between the controlling shares of major media outlets and political parties, along with sting operations revelaing how the biggest news outlets such as TOI and even major celebrities charging crores of rupess for a certain degree of control over what is printed/reported and what is not and in what manner that were systematically repressed and hidden from the public eyes, again in the most suspicious of circumstances. Below is also an extract from a recent interview by Ravish Kumar just to give one example Bernays techniques in action being confirmed by a credible personality  -

&gt;**What do you think happened to the Indian media in the last four years?**  
&gt;  
&gt;Unfortunately, the media have been serving only the powers that be and generating controversies that serve their purpose. \*\*\*There are diversions being created to take attention away from serious issues.\*\*\*The Aligarh Muslim University controversy is a case in point. It is an engineered controversy and so was the controversy around JNU ...   

In summary I strongly believe that this not merely a coincedence of the Engineering of Consent techniques and methods being applied in practice, but rather it is being done so very deliberately, in this case to avoid the very obvious pressure and heat the government was facing due to the rape culture that they would have been forced to do something about and speak against, including and mainly to avoid upsetting a lot of political relationships that they have built if they chose to actually speak against and take actions against the powers that be in UP, a very important state when it comes to national elections considering the number of seats and votes they have in parliment. I was wondering if one farmiliar in such methods and the teaching of Bernay's to weigh in with their thoughts and ideas on the same.

China and India Population is given in the below graph.

[Population Comparison between China and India](https://i.redd.it/cgsprcjyssi31.png)

&amp;#x200B;

The difference between the population of India and China is not even 6 crores. But the 10 ten web sites as 3 china specific websites. India has ZERO. You can say [google.co.in](https://google.co.in/) is there in the list. But, I am not treating that as India's indegenous website.

Similarly, China has its own Chatting app and may have other specifics too.

Seeing such things gives a feeling that India has not planted its own presence in the IT infrastructure and applications, etc.

The situation should change and India should run on its own services and Other countries to become India's customers...!

&amp;#x200B;

I bought an ASUS ROG Strix Vega 64 from Vedant Computers for 26999 - Asus seems to be taking huge hits on inventory losses in India to sell out stock.

My GPU was imported in March 2018 and the MRP is OVER 1 LAKH on the box. So it's basically being sold at nearly 75% discount on MRP.

&amp;#x200B;

Buy now before Asus runs out of stock. Some websites are also selling a similarly priced Gigabyte card.

These prices are actually on par or even cheaper than what you are getting in EU/US. So HURRY!

I am the author of some free open source utilities. Many of them are available in the default repos of popular Linux distros and Homebrew. I was thinking of adding documentation in Hindi (and probably more Indian languages if someone is interested) for some of these utilities and have specific Hindi wiki pages which Indian users can refer to. I believe it will be a great value addition.

My personal knowledge of Hindi is limited and it would be of great help if someone can pitch in. It's OK if (s)he is not very technical as I can help with simplfying the details.

But it did carry out the first and most detailed search for water on the Moon using radars.

Chandrayaan-2 is scheduled to land near the unexplored south pole of the Moon.

This mission focuses on the Moon, to find useful information about water, minerals and measuring moon-quakes.

India used its most powerful rocket, the **Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark III (GSLV Mk-III)**, for this mission. It weighed 640 tonnes (almost 1.5 times the weight of a fully-loaded 747 jumbo jet) and, at 44 meters (144ft), and was as high as a 14-story building. The journey is assumed to be a little more than six weeks, which is a lot longer than the four days the Apollo 11 mission took, 50 years ago, to land humans on the Moon for the first time.

To save fuel, ISRO has chosen an indirect route to benefit off of the Earth's gravity, which will help fasten the satellite towards the Moon. of the Earth's

""There will be 15 terrifying minutes for scientists once the lander is released and is hurled towards the south pole of the Moon,"" ISRO chief K Sivan said before the first launch attempt.

He explained that those who are controlling the spacecraft until it lands the moon will have to sit back and pray because the landing is automated. So, the actual landing would happen only if all the systems performed as they should. Otherwise, the satellite could crash into the surface of the Moon.
