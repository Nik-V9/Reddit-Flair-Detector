"What are your thoughts on Zomato Gold's Infinity Dining offer? For the uninitiated, it's a new scheme launched by Zomato, for exclusively its Gold members, which allows you to sample the entire menu of a restaurant [Food (barring some imported products) +non-alcoholic drinks] at a fixed price. Think of it as a buffet of sorts.

I was excited initially, and was actually thinking abt sampling some of the restaurants here, but the prices seem a bit steep for me, 1000 bucks for 1 person for the ones I wanna visit. Also, there's a distinction between imported meats (which you can't order) and the rest of the meats. 

At best, I think this scheme is suited for really high end restaurants, whose dishes are expensive enough to buy a slot and taste them out. 

Of course if you're a fan of non-alcoholic drinks, freakshakes and whatnot, you're in for a treat bcoz all that is covered in the cover charges. (entire menu!
) 


Also, looks like a lot of food is gonna get wasted this way. No doggy bags here either. People are just gonna order on whim and throw away the remaining food. 

What do you think?

In the light of some selfish thoughts, here's my zomato Gold code - use it to avail 20% off on Zomato Gold memberships, which can be used to avail Infinity Dining.

"Web Development vs App Development in India as a career. Hi, I am going to start my BTech in CSE from next month from a third tier college in West Bengal. I already love web development and I am proficient in HTML,CSS and Vanilla Javascript at the moment. My plan was to become a full stack developer. The career opportunities and salaries of Full stack developers are also very good and there is a demand of full stack developers. But I looked at starting salaries in my city Kolkata, they are paying 8k-15k per month for starting positions. How is that even a livable salary? They should atleast pay 20k for starting positions. Anyway, I looked up android development salaries and they are a bit better but available jobs are way less for android developers throughout the world.  What are the pros and cons of both in terms of career? Which can provide bigger salaries and bigger career opportunities in the long run? My aim is to get 4-5 years working experience, then move to Europe/USA. Can you please share  your experiences or give advice?",AskIndia

"My assessment on Indian Olympics contingent I was very excited about India's chances at Rio Olympics but sadly we were very unlucky there. I was very heartbroken after last Olympics. Been following Indian Olympics sports very closely for last 4 years and I feel this time we can genuinely finish with 10 medals (if we get some luck in our favour). Here are my predictions :-

1) Shooting is very unpredictable sport but this time we have many fearless youngsters who are performing exceptionally well. We should win more than 3 medals at least if all goes well. Our best chances are in events like 10m Air Pistol (both men & women), 10m Air Rifle (both men & women) and Mixed Air Pistol & Mixed Air Rifle team event. You can check performance of our shooting team here https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_ISSF_World_Cup

2) Mirabai Chanu is most certain to win a medal for us at Tokyo. At recently concluded World Championship she finished at fourth place with Chinese occupying top 2 spots. But in weightlifting, a country can only send one athlete in Olympics so that means Mirabai will be 3rd at worst. She is currently 13 kg ahead from her nearest competitor https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_World_Weightlifting_Championships_%E2%80%93_Women%27s_49_kg

3) I think everyone here is aware about Sindhu's badminton exploits. So I won't explain too much. We can also win a surprise medal in men's singles.

4) In Wrestling, Vinesh Phogat & Bajrang Punia is most certain to win a medal for us. We can also win one or two medals from wrestling if we get a favourable draw. Check our wrestling performance from ongoing World Championship https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_World_Wrestling_Championships

5) Amit Panghal is a favourite to win a medal in boxing. He is current Asian Games & Asian Championship gold medalist. He has recently won a silver in World Championship. There were 3 other Indian boxer who were in QF at world championship. I'm slightly unsure about India's chances in women's boxing.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_AIBA_World_Boxing_Championships

Outside of these 5 sports, we have half-chances to win a medal in few other sports like Archery, Hockey, Golf and Tennis. I'm not expecting any medals from athletics. Only Niraj Chopra can finish inside top 5 in athletics event.

This is my own assessment. Please tell me if I'm missing some other medal contenders.",Sports

"Advice needed for B-School. I am doing a Bsc in Information Technology from a reputed college, placements are decent in our college, last year average was 4.5 lacs and highest was 18 lacs, this sounds pretty good for a college with very low fees but i don't see myself doing something in IT field, i cleared the entrances for VIT,KIIT,SRM,Manipal,COMEDK and few others but i did not join any of them for the very same reason, i was pushed into science by my parents and they were also forcing me to join KIIT(which i still can join) but i convinced them somehow for a Bsc as placements in KIIT were not as tempting as they had expected. I choose Bsc due to it's short duration, cost effectiveness and  curriculum was not much different from engineering if you don't include first year of engineering. 

&#x200B;

It's a relief for me that i only have to study 3 years in Bsc, now coming to the main question, at the end of three years, an MBA seems to me to be the most plausible way of getting out of this mess, my previous academics (10th,12th) are good and i can also score good my graduation.

&#x200B;

TL;DR - Choose Bsc over Btech (don't like either of the two), want to do an mba.

&#x200B;

Now these are my questions :-

1) Does doing a Bsc instead of a Btech will have a negative impact during admission in B-Schools?

2) Are all these great packages that the top B-School pride themselves on are only for IITs/NITs graduates etc? 

3) What would you recommend for a person in a situation like this?

&#x200B;

If not top IIMs, i can surely get in top 10 schools.

&#x200B;

P.S - 1)My parents wanted me to do graduation only in CS,IT or Electronics, i have also cleared few entrances for BBA.

2) Money is not a problem, i'm open to all suggestions.

3) I want to go for a degree just after Bsc and don't want to work.",Science/Technology

"Pride and Prejudice I was having a beer while reading a book in the cafeteria in Deutsches Museum. A middle aged couple sat next to me. The lady said, ""Hello"".
""Hello"", I replied. The gentleman joined in, ""Studying in Munich?""
""No. Working"", I said. 
""Where you are from?""
""India"", I said. 
""Oh we are also originally from India. We live in USA. 20 years. Came here to visit our daughter and our grandchildren. We are originally from this city of that state in India"". I smiled and nodded and started speaking to them about that city in that state in India because I also lived there for 7 years. He started saying how much he misses his city and his country, being 20 long years in USA. I smiled and listened although I wanted to return to my book. Here I was sitting surrounded by the statues of Planck, Heisenberg, Einstein, Leibnitz and hundreds of scientists and mathematicians, the descriptions and depictions of their work in one of the best technical museums of the world containing hundreds of machines of the past, computers, ships, aircrafts, telescopes and what not and suddenly the gentleman said, ""No matter what one says, we are far ahead than them"". I was puzzled. ""What are we talking about?""

The man said, ""In shastra it is written - Everything comes from water and fire. Have you read Veda?"" and then he unfurled a shloka from Veda. I was quite amused. He then continued, ""Our Munis and Rishis have written everything about nuclear physics 5000 years back"". I interjected, ""That I would not know but I think that the contributions of the likes of Ramanujan, Bose, Raman and Chandrasekhar were enormous"". He skirted those names and said, ""I am an engineer. I have to tell you that India is at least 1000 years ahead than any country in science. One has to read Veda"" and then he fired another sloka. His wife was not getting impressed just as I was not making much sense of the sudden outpouring of Sanatan sentiments. 

I realised that it was better to move. But then he did not stop, ""You see it is a matter of what I call perspective. We knew thousands of years back what scientists here are knowing now. Chemistry, atomic physics, space everything we knew. At that time Europe was what? A dark continent. They knew nothing. We invented Zero, you know that?"" 

This is when I lost it. I asked him, ""Sir, you miss your city and your food and friends. That is quite understandable. But I do not understand why you have spent 20 years in USA and your daughter is married in Munich while you miss your country so much and you cannot stop praising it. Why don't you go and live in India? I also do not understand why you are even here when you should be in India digging Vedic spacecrafts. Why do you come to a Science and Technology museum in Germany to claim superiority on others' achievements? Indeed one can take the Indian out of India but one cannot take the India out of the Indian.""

His wife tugged at his arm before things escalated because I guess he was about to throw another salvo of slokas. They got up and left. I was left with a bitter taste in my mouth. It is not the ignorance that hurts so much, it is the misplaced pride that left me dumbfound and sick in my guts. ",Science/Technology

"Some thoughts on those not protesting or discussing the CAA and NRC/NPR issue The people who have been protesting and who have been seen protesting are just a fraction or
the minority of the total population of the country. There is still the majority of the people who
continue their lives as normal and have not commented on this issue. 
These protests are said to be driven by the youth but the youth we are seeing protesting are only a small fraction of the total youth. Even among the social workers and NGO workers there are only a small fraction of them who are commenting or sharing their support on social media. 
This is a major issue asthese people are uncaring and unconcerned not just about this issue but other major issues unless it directly affects and impacts them. They are also fearful and a bit lazy for not reading up on these issues and thus not understanding their importance and consequences.
There have been attempts during these protests to shame these people into showing their
support however by and large the majority of society still remains quiet and continuing their lives
as usual.
There needs to be more engagement by this section of the society as they cannot be neutral or
unconcerned with the ruling party doing door to door campaigns about the CAA and NRC/NPR
and also encouraging the people to call a number to show their support for it. 
They should thennot complain when the time comes when they are forced to stand in long queues with theirdocuments and told that they can't be put on the NRC/NPR or have to hunt for their documents and pay a huge amount for them to agents and those in the government offices.

>Only time will tell if this was our finest hour but at present, I am positive that the steps you and your government is taking will save our lives and also our economy and minimise the losses.

"Sturdy minimalistic watch on a budget? Hey r/India, would you guys please help me out by suggesting me some good minimalistic watches? The preferences and requirements are below:  
Gender: Man  
Strap: Leather belt  
Style: Minimalistic  
Dial colour: White or black preferred   
Budget: Below 1000-1500 (Yes, I know this is super low for a good watch but trust me I'd have spent much more if I could. Although, I might be able to stretch this to 2000 because of my birthday)  


Little context(can skip): I searched for posts related to watches on this sub and that is how I came to know about hmt watches. I wish I could buy any of their product(all the good ones are out of stock). I remember myself breaking and throwing away my mom and dad's hmt watches when I was a kid. But now I'm all about the classic stuff. \*Sigh\*   
Anyway coming to the main topic, I had a [Sonata watch](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B073X344H2) as my daily driver and one [Timex watch](https://www.flipkart.com/timex-tw002e118-analog-watch-men/p/itmf3zheazwh69j3?pid=WATEGTME7H8Z4T7Z&amp;lid=LSTWATEGTME7H8Z4T7ZCMBFZG) as my 'good' watch. I lost both of them last month and now I kind of need 2 watches. I am considering [this](https://www.myntra.com/4451900) as my daily wear since it's the closest to being sporty and minimal at the same time. But if I buy this one then I'll have to save up and buy a good one later so I might just buy one that serves the purpose of a fancy and sturdy watch at once.",AskIndia

"These Corona virus events are not the best way to judge Modi’s popularity. Hear me out. I have seen a lot of commentary online about how these taali banging and candlelight events show Modi’s unparalleled popularity and what it means for the future of our democracy. While it is true Modi is an extremely popular politician, I don’t think these events are the best way to measure it. Here is why:

* To begin with, most national leaders see a spike in their popularity when the country is facing a crisis. This is commonly known as [Rally 'round the flag effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rally_%27round_the_flag_effect). (For example, Trump, even after his colossal mismanagement in dealing with the Corona virus outbreak, has seen an increase in his approval ratings). Sadly, this makes the pandemic a good opportunity for populists and fascists to seize more power, and that should worry us. ([For Autocrats, and Others, Coronavirus Is a Chance to Grab Even More Power](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/30/world/europe/coronavirus-governments-power.html))

* Only a small percentage of people understand the semi-political nature of these events. For most people these were non-political events to fight Corona virus. Many people who might vote for other parties also took part in these events for a variety of reasons, including and not limited to love for the country (Rally 'round the flag effect), peer pressure, manufactured consent through media, boredom etc. 

* These events happened at a time when the entire country is under lockdown (something like this probably wouldn't be as successful as it was if there was no lockdown). People are locked in the house and glued to the TVs. Modi Govt used this situation to communicate and seek support for his events by non-stop media coverage. It didn’t matter which news channel you watched in the last few weeks, you couldn’t escape the marketing for these events. Dozens of popular film stars, sportspersons, religious leaders, etc were deployed to spread awareness and seek support for these “non-political” events. I doubt many of these celebrities will openly lend their support for Modi’s other openly political projects like CAA or NRC.

* Many news channels also portrayed the act of lighting the lamps as a prayer to the God to help fight the virus. Given how religious this country is and the situation we are in, the message was naturally persuasive for many people. **This is what really forced some in my family to light the lamps, not the message of solidarity or politics**. A few news outlets packaged yesterday’s event primarily as a prayer more than anything else and that worked.

* Opposition, whatever little is left, couldn’t openly oppose these events. The either unenthusiastically supported them or just kept quiet. That won’t necessarily be the case under normal circumstances.

* It is my assessment that the **devastating effects of the pandemic on the economy will have infinitely more impact on Modi's political future** then these marketing events. A lot of potential political damage to Modi on this would also depend on the performance of Congress as an opposition, and that’s a sign of worry given the state of the grand old party.

* Modi’s popularity is a by-product of a compromised media ecosystem. These PR stunts by Modi and the communalization of the outbreak proved that once again. So, in my view, **it’s the death of independent media that should worry us more than Modi’s popularity, as the latter stems from the former**. Sadly, I don’t see a solution for the media problem anytime soon. On the bright side, Modi’s popularity doesn’t automatically translate into victories in state elections for the party. We have seen that in the recent assembly elections where BJP lost despite major political events like the dilution of the Article 370 and the Ram Mandir verdict.

"Please help me out. Hello r/India.
This post is a bit personal, just need help and some mental peace.If my sentences are a bit incoherent please forgive me because I'm overwhelmed with emotions at the moment. 
So here begins my story,I (24M) was born and brought up in Kerala. I got through the medical entrance exam and took up a medical seat in Maharashtra . Didn't have any problems but felt homesick finally got over it and started studying for my future in medicine. The first semester in Ist M.B.B.S goes very good, my problems begin in the second semester where i start having issues with my health.During this period i consulted many doctors. I'm unstable and bed ridden, taking multiple pain killers and muscle relaxants prescribed by them.The doctors aren't able to give me a diagnosis a few months pass keep in mind even in such a state I'm studying. I give my prelim examination and barely make it. I'm geared up to give my Ist M.B.B.S exam. My health takes a turn for the worst and now I'm unable to move, my parents come all the way from Kerala. They aren't able to see me in such a state and they take me back to Kerala . They get me checked up and within 2 days the competent doctor gives me the diagnosis, i have T.B spine. My parents are shell shocked, my mother starts crying. I felt numb. I felt helpless. My treatment schedule is put in place and i start with my medication. The treatment plan was for a year, with physiotherapy. Luckily the  vertebrae involved ankylosed without causing a need for surgical involvement. I healed physically. Now my treatment was done,  i was healthy. But during this period all the friends i had made in my college, were now strangers. I had become a social pariah. I didn't disclose my illness except to 1 close friend who was also from Kerala . He kept me updated on what was going on in college even though he had moved to the second year. I had completed my treatment and had to sit for the Ist M.B.B.S exam. With 2 months left after my treatment, i give it my all and with the grace of God i make it through. Now begins the second year, I'm with a completely new batch. I became a junior. Nobody knows who i am. I thought i get a fresh start. But slowly the news spreads and they get to know that I'm from their senior batch. Initially they assumed i was a transfer. Initially people tried making small talk with me and i was soon ""friends"" with a few of the people from this batch. Slowly i was isolated and my ""seniors"" wanted nothing to do with me. I was completely alone, even my close friend got busy with his life and abandoned me aswell. My parents kept asking me how the new batch was and if i had adjusted. I lied to them just to make them feel better that everything was perfect. Keep in mind my parents are doctors and they have extremely busy schedules and I didn't want to burden them further. Now somehow i have kept myself together with the support of my parents, the only people i talk to are my parents. I somehow made it through the second and third year aswell, now I'm in my final year. This year has been nerve-wracking. All i do is study, eat and sleep. I'm completely alone. All the ridicule i face from my batchmates and juniors has got me all messed up ( for something that wasnt my fault at all). I don't know who i can trust anymore.I have no one in my life besides my family. There is only so much I can take. I'm in another state away from home questioning my sanity. My batchmates are now in internship. They'll graduate soon. Everyday i keep thinking what i had done to deserve this. I keep thinking is it worth it to even live anymore.  Why should i pain myself to become a doctor at all under such pathetic conditions? Why should i have to live with this? If this is how the society is I'd rather be dead.",Scheduled

A Bribery Case

>Transcripts of purported conversations between the three accused persons – retired Odisha high Court Judge I.M. Qudussi, middleman Vishwanath Agarwala and B.P. Yadav of the Prasad Education Trust – in the medical college bribery scam reveals that college officials had, in fact, planned to bribe senior functionaries of the Supreme Court and the Allahabad High Court in return for a favourable judgement, reports The Wire. [1](https://thelogicalindian.com/news/transcripts-cbi-tapes-accused-medical-college-bribery-scam-prashant-bhushan-cji-dipak-misra)

**CJI Mishra was one of the judge who gave the judgement \[mentioned above\].**

&#x200B;

There was lot of tussle among top judges.

[**2 bench judge said: It should be taken up by top 5 judges;  which was overturned by the** ](https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2017/nov/10/tussle-in-judiciary-sc-reverses-order-says-cji-is-master-of-the-roster-prashant-bhushan-walks-out-1697879.html)[**bench headed by CJI**](https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2017/nov/10/tussle-in-judiciary-sc-reverses-order-says-cji-is-master-of-the-roster-prashant-bhushan-walks-out-1697879.html)**.**

>Justice Chelameswar, who is the senior-most judge after the CJI, had ordered setting up of the five-judge bench of top judges of the apex court as a petition by an NGO and an advocate had claimed there were allegations against Justice Misra.  
>  
>However, in a dramatic development, the CJI today set up a five-judge bench headed by him and overturned yesterday's order of the two-judge bench, saying the Chief Justice had the sole prerogative of setting up a bench and allocating matters.

&#x200B;

Then,

[**He constituted a three-judge Bench to hear the graft case involving allegations of bribery against members of the higher judiciary.**](https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2017/nov/11/judges-bribery-case-amid-tussle-cji-dipak-misra-says-all-cases-to-be-listed-before-him-1698693.html)

>The three-judge Bench, which would now hear the case on Monday, also comprises Justices R K Agrawal, Arun Mishra and A M Khanwilkar, who were also part of the five-judge Constitution Bench that declared on Friday that it was the CJI’s prerogative to decide which case would be assigned to which Bench.

&#x200B;

**Dipak Mishra, in his entire tenure, gave cases without following SC tradition; which later led to a major event in the history of India.**

On 12 January 2018, four senior judges of the Supreme Court; [Jasti Chelameswar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasti_Chelameswar), [Ranjan Gogoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranjan_Gogoi), [Madan Lokur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madan_Lokur) and [Kurian Joseph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurian_Joseph) addressed a press conference criticising Misra's style of administration and allocation of cases. However, people close to Misra refuted these allegations.[\[27\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipak_Misra#cite_note-27)[\[28\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipak_Misra#cite_note-28)[\[29\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipak_Misra#cite_note-29)  \[I think everyone know about this quite well, So I won't elaborate\]

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Then there's Ranjan Gogoi: I wrote elaborately about him:  [Justice Ranjan Gogoi: The Worst Chief Justice of India (I've ever seen)](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/exexa4/justice_ranjan_gogoi_the_worst_chief_justice_of/)

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

I'm not directly blaming BJP over this \[contrary to the title\].

But let's take a look:

1. Jagdish Singh Khehar's case related to the death of  K Pul.
2. Dipak Mishra: K Pul case &  Bribery case.
3. Ranjan Gogoi : Sexual harassment case.

In all 3 cases, BJP Govt came heavily in support of these judges.

Did it make these judges to incline towards BJP?

Had there been proper protocols to deal with such incidents, which upholds the integrity of SC, wouldn't it be better?

"What's next for the CAA+NPR+NRC protests In the aftermath of the Delhi pogrom, the spotlight the protests were occupying seems to be diminishing with every passing day. 

Moreover most of the talk about the pogroms is emotionally charged gossip. The AAP's complicity by not taking any action at all, and failing miserably with connecting with public, is conveniently being neglected. AAP needs to make amends. We can still look up to AAP in the hope that they are unlike BJP.

The onus should not be on the victims to be left to fight for themselves.  When all the institutions of the establishment fail, the civil society must to step in. Some altruistic people are already taking good steps by volunteering relief material but the scale is abysmal. The victims are left at the benevolence of a few, the state is turning away, the judiciary is abdicating from its responsibilities. Like what kinda mess is this. I hope more people can offer help other than just pity and the state addresses the situation with the urgency that it begs. 


Aside from that, we must remind ourselves that the CAA, NPR and NRC monster is still lurking. It hasn't gone away. India isn't in good hands. The establishment is trying too hard to suppress dissent and they seem to get away with every illegal thing they do. They have a great sense of entitlement. But the protests must go on to protect the idea of India our forefathers had envisioned, to protect the values enshrined in our constitution.

"ACCOUNTABILITY: This is what is wrong with Indian bureaucracy and our Brown Lords. If you are an Indian, it would be an astronomically impossible odd that you didn’t hear of how corrupt our bureaucracy is or how some **‘babu‘** or some **‘bade sahab‘** is corrupt and nothing more than a public disgrace. **That’s Indian bureaucracy for you.**

The real problem with bureaucrats is not just about caste and reservation. It is about accountability and responsibility. The pay structure of our Bureaucracy is such that officers get little salaries and large perks and amenities in form of bungalows and servants. In many cases, they occupy the same bungalows that the British left in 1947. And they do not do their job responsibly.

Fair disclosure that *I do understand and acknowledge the fact not all bureaucrats are corrupt. In fact, we have exemplary civil servants that have served as an inspiration to us all.* But this post is not about them, those honest civil servants. This is about what is wrong with Indian bureaucracy. The problem is not about the political issue or power struggles, but about an entire class of bureaucrats who are egoistic, arrogant, inhumane, corrupt and muddled with skulduggery.

**Bureaucrats, Bureaucracy, and Bureaucratic Measures** are now modern day derogatory overtones that express tyranny, arrogance and debilitation in our country’s governance. Bureaucrats are, in this day and age, perceived as those with massive egos and false nationalist zealotry. They are in essence a rule-bound bookkeepers who have ‘I’ mentality when it comes to interpreting rules. They play favorites, they are biased, they stay vague so that they are not held accountable, and they maintain chaos so that no one can see them cheat.

**From Outside: Looking In**

Don’t take my word for it. *I am just an ordinary Indian citizen exercising my freedom of speech.* Wouldn’t it help if you could see our Indian bureaucracy from an outside view? It is said that an unbiased opinion comes from the uninvolved. So let’s do that. Let’s see what others think of Indian bureaucracy.

In October 2010, just after the conclusion of Commonwealth Games in India, Eric Ellis wrote a post titled ‘A most uncivil service‘ on The Age where he talks about the Indian bureaucracy. Unfortunately, he has nothing good to say. He writes the following –

>""The Delhi games showed the world just what can be done when it's daunting civil service takes control – and the result wasn’t pretty. Corruption, waste, inefficiency, obfuscation and a cancerous lack of accountability in officialdom – and all of it on an Olympian scale.

>Delhi’s dramas may have been revealing for observers who briefly touch India but sadly these are the common issues daily confronting and long bedeviling a billion Indians and the foreign investors urged to invest their money in business there. Some economists have calculated that India’s bureaucratic inefficiency costs the country 1 to 2 points in annual growth.

>India’s daunting civil service is supposed to be the pride of the nation – just ask its privileged nabobs – but instead its malfunction and misgovernance hold India back. Enter any average government office in India and one is struck by the mountains of yellowing paperwork, years of filing and unfinished work ground down by the sheer scale of chaotic India’s myriad issues that overwhelm.""


Another account by Lant Pritchett of Harvard University sheds some brighter light on the Indian bureaucratic problem. In a paper, in 2009, titled “Is India a Failing State?“, he described Indian bureaucracy to be one of the most serious problems in the world today; up there with AIDS and climate change. He makes a point that foreign investments, and any welfare schemes in India for that matter, will never improve India’s economy as long as there is an inefficient Indian bureaucracy. These bureaucrats are like a tumorous growth that eat away any welfare funds like a parasite.

In his book “The Foundation Pillars for Change: Our Nation, Our Democracy & Our Future”, **Mr. V.K. Patel** writes that *most developmental spending fails to reach its intended recipients. It is either diverted or misused by a sizeable and a complacent bureaucracy.* I corroborate to Mr. Patel’s description of bureaucracy.

*We need to take away these IAS’s comfortable life devoid of any accountability for their country. Take away their big bungalows, their VIP status, their guards, their peons, their orderlies and hook them up to a system where they are rewarded for their good acts and punished for their bad deeds. Unless and until such an overhaul happens, India is not going to be a great country. No welfare policies will ever come to fruition. India cannot change without a change in our bureaucratic system. This is what is wrong with the Indian bureaucracy.*",Policy/Economy

"Are there no centrists in India who are not completely polarised by political ideologies and are objective in assessing & supporting Govts based only on their administration? I am a centrist. An Indian who believes that Govts and political parties are not boyhood football, cricket and other sports teams that you have to be loyal to and support no matter what or oppose no matter what. 

I can praise a party for the right steps they took and criticise the same people for the wrong ones. 

Just like it happens in good corporate cultures. Based on merit & performance. 

No one or no party is bigger than the country and what it good for the future of it's people. Why can't we as citizens start getting more objective in our assessment? The best countries on Earth have the least amount of political polarisation as the people there only want progress. 

For eg. Not everything that a party XYZ has done is correct because you support them and not everything the same party did is wrong is because you loathe them. 

Currently I find it difficult to find like minded people who are objective in their outlook without having to identify themselves rigidly with being completely anti someone or completely pro someone. I feel we can never progress until we come out of this fanboyism.

"Last Week in Parliament (July 18 to July 22) Hello /r/India,

I return with another four weeks of fun and frolic at the expense of our elected leaders in Parliament!

Last week, a shiny new cabinet was sworn in, a spirited discussion on Kashmir crisis (and TN Fishermen and Bangladeshi infiltrators) happened, an unknown rule was invoked unknowingly and shot down promptly and many legislations were passed.
Let’s get right into it!

___
#Shiny new Cabinet sworn in
___

Apart from the [53 new members](http://164.100.47.5/Newmembers/partymemberlist.aspx) that were sworn into Rajya Sabha, PM Modi introduced his new ministers to both houses. Prakash Javadekar replaced Smriti Irani as Minister of Human Resource Development, Vijay Goyal was given Ministry of State (Independent Charge) for Youth Affairs & Sports and Anil Madhav Dave was sworn in as the new Minister of State (Independent charge) of Environment forest and Climate Change. A whole host of new Ministers of State were also sworn in. 

I know what you’re thinking.
 
*What’s the difference between a Cabinet Minister, Minister of State (Independent Charge) and Minister of State?* 

**Cabinet Minister**: Person is given full control over a Ministry and is eligible to attend cabinet meetings (which is the highest decision-making body of the country).

**Minister of State (Independent Charge)**: Person is given charge over a ministry, but the PMO keeps a close watch on how the ministry is functioning. These ministers are allowed to attend cabinet meetings only if the PM’s permits them to do so.

**Minister of State**: Person is given charge of a specific department or just a part of a Ministry, especially when the Ministry is large (Eg: Home, Defence or Finance). The Cabinet Minister has complete authority to decide what tasks are to be given to the MoS within the Ministry. MoS cannot attend cabinet meetings.

Casual Observation: Out of all those who were sworn in, Arjun Ram Meghwal seemed to have gotten the loudest thumps and cheers. He used to be the Chief Whip of BJP in Lok Sabha and has now been made MoS of Finance. 
Seems like he won’t be able to [bicycle to Parliament anymore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxyz8YASYHk).

Bonus: Here’s the [mother of all government directories](http://goidirectory.nic.in/union_categories.php?ct=E002), in case you want to find out how to reach ministries. This includes state ministries and PSUs as well. Explore away!

___
#Kashmir Crisis… Bangladeshi Infiltration and Tamil Fishermen
___
Discussions were held in both houses of Parliament regarding the ongoing agitation happening in the Kashmir Valley. While accusations flew thick between the Congress and BJP, regional parties like AIADMK and TMC decided to bring in their own international border issues into the discussion.

Kalyan Banerjee from TMC started speaking about infiltration from Bangladesh to West Bengal when he was interrupted by Ananth Kumar, Minister of Chemicals and Fertilizers. He pointed out the Mr Banerjee was going off topic. 

[Then this happened](http://imgur.com/lWsluww)

You're killin it Khargeji!

AIADMK’s A Anwar Raajhaa (With the kind blessings of [Puruchithalaiva Amma](http://mythicalindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/weird_jayalalitha_fans.jpg)) spoke about Kashmir and then switched to talk about the problem of fishermen in Tamil Nadu who are being harassed by the Sri Lankan Navy. Raanjhaa demanded that this should be declared as a national issue as well.

___
#Parliament resumes, Lok Sabha Adjourns
___
The Parliament was summoned on July 18 for the monsoon session and the news was splattered with headlines like “Parliament resumes, Lok Sabha adjourns”. 

Everyone was like, “What?! Why do these politicians keep disrupting the house? Why don’t these people want to work?” 

Well, they do, but they couldn’t help it this time round.

The adjournment wasn’t because of disruptions, which is usually the cause, but for paying respects to a sitting member of Parliament who passed away. Mr Dalpat Singh Parasate of Shahdol constituency in Madhya Pradesh passed away on June 1 (#RIP). 

It’s a followed practice that in case of the death of a sitting member, Parliament will not transact any business on the first day of sitting as a mark of respect. In case an MP dies while the Parliament is in session, the house is adjourned for the following day. In the Budget session, Mr PA Sangma passed away and a similar adjournment followed. His son Conrad Sangma now occupies his seat of Tura (Meghalaya). 

The first order of business for this session in Lok Sabha was [his swearing in](http://imgur.com/vgFFwdH).

Interestingly enough, Rajya Sabha has decided in May 2016 to [curtail this practice](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rajya-sabha-not-to-adjourn-for-day-if-sitting-member-dies-in-intersession-period/article8672837.ece) if the Member of Parliament passes in the interim period. The upper house will now only adjourn if an MP dies during sessions. Lok Sabha sticks to its ol’ ways. 

___
#Thou Shalt not read out Speeches
___

While giving his speech on the Kashmir crisis, A Anwar Raajhaa of the AIADMK happened to just read it out from a few sheets of paper. He even mixed up the sheets in the middle and went off course a few times. 

Rao Indrajit Singh, MoS of Urban Development, took strong offence and got up to object. He asked the chair to stop him because there is a rule against reading out speeches in the Parliament. Well, he goofed up a little though. The person in the chair was Deputy Speaker Dr M Thambidurai. He’s from the AIADMK.

Thambidurai seemed visibly upset that the chair was being questioned and asked Singh to sit down. Although a lot of the conversation was not put on record, witnesses of LSTV will vouch about the use of the word “he’s speaking nonsense” being thrown around rather loudly. At one point, Mr Singh seemed to have given out the impression to the Deputy Speaker that he was being partial towards his own party member. The otherwise calm and gentle Thambidurai seemed to be visibly upset. 

The funny thing is that this is actually a rule. Rule 352 of the [Procedure and Conduct of Business](http://parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/rules/rules.html) says: 

> “A member while speaking shall not…. (xi) read a written speech except with the previous permission of the Chair.” 

So in this case, there was no clarity whether or not the prior permission of the chair was taken. If only Mr Rao Indrajit Singh quoted the rule number, he might have been able to achieve his objective. 

Mods, pliss to tweet the correct rule to him?

___
#A few other interesting rules (for teh lulz)
___

**Rule 349**: Whilst the House is sitting, a member-

(iii) shall bow to the Chair while entering or leaving the House, and also when taking or leaving his seat 

[We’re not worthy!](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/not-worthy.gif)

(iv) shall not pass between the Chair and any member who is speaking 

[YOU SHALL NOT PASS!](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/shall-not-pass.gif)

(x) shall not applaud when a stranger enters any of the Galleries, or the Special Box

It is not necessary that sources should belong to India. We can also discuss about BBC, the diplomat, IDSA, Washington post, huffington post, guardian and other internet resources (I am not implying that they are bad but we should discuss them)

"Here's my side of the story as a small businessman This is going to be long. I would really appreciate it if you can read this fully. Thank you for your attention in advance. 

I'm not sure what to flair this post as. I'm on a throwaway account that I may or may not continue using and I just want to share my side of the story while I sit here in loneliness watching random videos on Youtube just to get my mind off of things. And with no sign of sleep at all.

>About me & my partners

I'm a late 20s guy who quit his job two years ago and went ahead and jumped into the Indian startup ecosystem to start my business. I'm also a college dropout by choice so I don't have a graduate degree but I really loved the business WE were running. Me along with two of the bestest friends were my partners and I feel responsible for them. One of them quit his safe cushy job when I messaged him at 2am in the morning with my idea and the other one trusted me enough to fund this whole machine. I'm extremely lucky to have these people in my life and I acknowledge that.

>Our Business - What we do

Our business isn't one of those apps or tech related business. We're more into the supply chain and making product sourcing and fulfillment for people in the ecommerce sphere easy. Think of it in a way that I'm sourcing and exporting products that my clients sell on their ecom sites. I loved this because this is something that solved a problem for my own hobby turning it into a full-fledged business and it was also helping me create a legit machine with a brand name that also helped me capture clients.

>How has the lockdown affected my business?

Being a new business we were ALMOST breakeven. Most of the money we were losing was because of bad decisions and mistakes but everyday we were losing less. Also had a bunch of profitable days and weeks which helped us not invest more from our own pockets into the business. We had created a cycle where the money that came in helped us with all the costs.

Me along with the partner who had invested money into the business were not taking out salaries (reason why I said almost breakeven) and I was making sure that the third partner got paid because he left his good job and to assure his family members - remember, we're all in our late 20s. We had also hired some help to help us in the office and with the vendors that we were dealing with. Basically the plan was to spend only when absolutely necessary and while doing it this way we also made sure that we had a life outside of work.

This worked smoothly with some hitches of course.

In January when I read about the first covid-19 case in India, I was scared. Things got bad real soon around the world. With every passing day I was worried more and more about what I was going to do in case our country went into a complete lockdown. I checked and tried to do some analysis in order to see if we can still work it if we do go into the lockdown.

But the fact of the matter is that my business heavily depends on vendors and shipping providers and the latter is out of my control and reach. The main part of this whole thing was shipping which I had taken so much pain to setup.

One thing I learned while doing all this is that there's a reason why India with such manpower and about mediocre infra in our industry isn't able to fulfill even a fraction of the demand. It's because the vendors are lazy. Even if you promise to pay them above the market rate, make payments on time and even help them financially to source the raw materials, they are not willing to work for it. And I'm not talking about overtime or anything.. Just their normal work cycle. They are not serious about it at all.

I had multiple vendors but only one of them worked properly and listened to me when there was an urgency in the order we were giving them. We had this second vendor who just wasn't serious about the work and we were giving them loads of work. Within a month I was their biggest client and they did work properly for the first two months but after that it all went to shit. I couldn't change my vendor because that's a long process of renegotiating and setting everything up which I couldn't do in my volumes which were high.

I wrote all this because when my city got the first few Covid-19 cases, I started urging them to get my work done as soon as possible. We were given assurances, promises, we paid in advance but it all went to shit because now I have an inventory of products that is ready to go but I cannot send them due to the state borders being closed. My shipping company is not able to function and all these need to be sent out of India.

I'm now in a sea of uncertainty where I have to pay my bills, pay my office rent, pay salaries with whatever I have in the business account right now.

>The finances

I'm not even worried about the money, I'm worried about the inventory I have, I'm worried about the payment disputes I need to deal with because these are all orders to be sent outside India. For every payment dispute I lose, I lose $15 extra. The money for the customer acquisition cost is already paid for. The money for the raw materials are to be paid and I'm refunding customers everyday. Losing that customer acquisition amount along with any margin that I might have earned.

>What do I mean exactly? 

Now, I'm all for Life>Money but as a small businessman who has been thinking, living, breathing his business all the time for months and years, I'm going insane. I'm having panic attacks, I don't know what I will do next. I used to have a plan for everything, now I don't. I'm not able to let this go and this pain is almost physical now. My head hurts all the time, I sleep for a few hours and when I wake up my eyes are still red and they feel as if they're burning.

I'm also sure that there are businesses out there that are into deeper shit than I am but that in my own opinion shouldn't be a comfort for me. I'm not sadistic.

I have no savings, my company is running out of money, there are people who need to be paid, employees to pay and a partner who invested with trust and is now seeing the money disappear into thin air daily - he's a kind soul and hasn't said a single word for it yet.

But I feel responsible and I'm not able to calm down. Anxiety is on its peak for me right now and I have no plans to save us from this.

I come to this sub daily and I actively participate in discussions and disses but I haven't seen anything about small business people here and just wanted to tell my side of the story.

I'm scared guys, I'm not even religious and can just hope that the govt. probably is thinking of exporters in this scenario to maybe help us in this situation.

I'm wishing you all good health and please stay inside.

I'm going to try and sleep now. Thank you for reading this.",Business/Finance

"We might have entered the exponential growth stage of infection in India that is characteristic of the spread of Covid-19. Here's how. The number of cases in India has risen exponentially in the last few days. [Going from 150 cases daily to now 500-600 cases daily.](https://i.imgur.com/zjRoSAJ.png) 3730 total cases in the country as of today, a week earlier, there were 1180 cases.

Seeing the [growth trajectory of the confirmed cases country by country](https://i.imgur.com/noXGCYY.png), it can be seen that India is still on an upward trajectory AND has not yet reached the peak, one essential thing that shows the slowing down of infection in a country. With other countries, you can see they've started to curve in the graph. So the worst is still yet to come, and we won't know how much the rate of infection has been until testing capacity is increased multifold. The infection spread rate however have slowed because of the lockdown.

The country needs to be prepared with the worst that is yet to come, with PPE, Ventilators and all other necessary equipment.

The work here is repetitive, with an outdated technology stack and that's why I have been planning to leave it. But I am confused whether to switch the job or do post graduation?

Some background - I graduated from a private college with a BTech degree with average marks. I had some interest in coding since school days that's why I opted for Computer Science. But in the past few months I have come to realize the work I am doing right now is menial and I don't have the skills required to get a job in a good tech company. I have been trying to study to improve them. But without any set target or deadline, I have just wasted the time procrastinating. Also a couple of failed job interviews has made me to think to stop planning about switching and do something else. Like post graduation. GATE and CAT are the only options I have been thinking about because I don't want to study abroad. I have been more inclined towards CAT because syllabus of GATE is vast and since I feel I am good in Logical and Verbal problem solving, given a 8-9 month preparation period I might crack the CAT exam with good percentile. But then I am not sure whether I should leave the tech side for good and switch to management instead.

Please give me some advise about what I should do now. Also please share if anything else comes to your mind that can work for me.",Science/Technology

"[Useless thought] Does anybody else feels like BJP is trying to orchestrate a foreign country's / entity's control over India? their actions are remarkably simmilar to administrations that have done this before all over the world .



 First they win over the population by winning over the majority then declare the minority is conspiring day and night to finish 'us' I.e. the majority,  



be extremely vocal against foreign influence no matter good or bad when they are not in power. e.g.  FDI bill of UPA time allowing for 75% of FDI in retail . BJP going crazy over secular govts attack on their baniya brothers. This is an actual quote by gadkari . Sushma swaraj announcing she'll shave her head out side parliament if such draconian laws are passed.



Then when they come to power they passed 100% FDI bill shamelessly within months  .




There are numerous examples like this like the India US nuclear deal etc. If you look closely it becomes so clear that BJP has tried to weaken Indias standing in the world setting as a self relient powerhouse and but on other hand  increasing the market value of Indias, their end game seems like to make a consumption giant in today's global economy , a mere  market for foreign players to sell their good in , kind of like a watered down version of British raj 




But Indians,  myself included were made to think opposite,  Thanks to BJPs marketing game . They made us believe that BJP is taking all the right actions , bringing India back to her glory days . Now I realised the newly found respect from Goras and chinis is because we are making our markets easier for then . Indians hate that ,All this was impossible if BJP didn't have their Propoganda power . 


In Points the step they are taking :


1&gt; made party funding totally opaque,  now they can receive huge funding from anywhere ,no question asked 

2&gt; control large no of media outlets , made all of their voter base to watch it religiously.  Think for a moment,  can a self respecting,  successful , unbiased person watch channels like zee , India TV?

3&gt; after winning majority vote they merged their organization with the idea of nation . Now you cannot criticize BJP without being accused of anti nationalism. 
BJP = Bharat 



4&gt; slowly taking away human aspect of enemy group from their target audiences conscience.

But what they don't get is this hatred will shift toward their own after, if always does, after they're done with muslims most probably baniya, jains, gujjars  or other well off communities will be the target. 



5&gt;eliminated competition,  a viable option for people to turn to when they realise it's time for a new govt .

6&gt; Shifting of point of comparison,  I Remember people used to be unhappy during Manmohan days that India is performing not so good w.r.t China, singapore and USA in key sectors . Nowadays people are happy that we're out performing Pakistan in almost all sectors.



7&gt;instilled  fear of extinction in target audiences  ,constant violence,  riots and rape involving communal angle to keep the narrative us vs them rather than have people focus on real issues concerning the nation. 




&gt; this is not a point for the argument but another observation,  Hindutva imo was never possible to grow into this level of degeneracy if it wasn't for radical Muslim leaders having a free hand for so long. And no small percent of every community argument is not valid here. 



Last generation of middle class and rich muslims is directly responsible for this , they never spoke against I'll commented by their members,  I doubt know how but even the most emphatic muslims I know can just turn their head the other way if the culprit involved is Muslim and victim is not. 



Who is most vocal about hindutva ? Other Hindus


Who stoped separatist movement when they turned violent in Punjab? Sikhs



Who was most vocal against church abuse ?  Christians .



Unless we acknowledge this fact BJP will keep riding on the us vs them sentiment no matter how much we abuse Modi or Shah.

"Can Indians grow a spine already? I am so sick of Indian men and women being pressured into arranged marriages. I am sick of the whole virginity being the sacred bowl of purity, sick of aunties who will keep on nagging you to get married. This is absurd. 

Everyone puts up the whole, 'Arranged marriages are done with consent' bs. Are they though? Deep inside everyone knows that the majority of the Indian population is pressured into marriage. 

Let's see, if someone pressures you to have sex, it is *sexual assault*, right? It is a crime. You shouldn't be pressured into *anything*, not even marriage. I can't believe how manipulative parents can get, 'I will slit my wrists if you don't get married', 'You will see my dead face if you don't get married'. Here's the thing, taking your own life needs a *lot of courage*, trust me, I have tried. *Your parents won't take their own lives for this*. You are an adult, probably earning, you can take care of yourself and take your own decisions. *Please don't be pressured and ruin two lives*, hell maybe 3 lives, if we assume that you will have a child. I am from a dysfunctional family, arranged marriage, of course, and my life has been hell. I remember wishing that my parents never got married, even if it resulted in me not being in this world. 

Here's the thing, life's already complicated, you need to earn, do your job, take care of yourself and others, etc, why make life more difficult with things that don't need to be complicated. Socialize, date, make friends, find common interests, know each other for *years*, marry. That's how biology of the body is. 

Some say that arranged marriages have a courtship period, but how long does it last? The maximum amount of time I have seen someone just being engaged in an arranged marriage is 1 year. Not to mention, the courtships can be in an controlled environment and fixed meeting and schedules. How can you be sure your partner wants to marry? Hell, how can you be sure? Is it because *this is just the next step*? What if your sexual libidos, kinks don't match?
 I, for a fact know that I won't marry someone until I have know them for atleast 3 years! It's sad to see where the society is going. You can say that that's how the culture of India is, but does the culture have any value if it suppresses and unnaturalizes the whole concept of love and relationships, the way biology works? If it affects mental health? After all, isn't culture just man-made? Only the positive aspects of culture should be kept. Relationships, sex, love are natural. Nothing *sacred*. If you want arrange marriage, good for you, just make sure your partner has *actually consented*.

Sincerely, a rant by me. Seeing my dear best friend in depression after being emotionally blackmailed into a marriage with same threats of suicide, 'log kya kahenge', etc has been terrible. Know that parents are not Gods, they are humans whom you should definitely respect but they *do* make mistakes. Even if love marriage doesn't work, you have yourself to blame, not your parents and part in your own terms. If you are pressured into a marriage, how can you say that you won't be pressured to no divorce? 

Stand up for yourself.

Edit: This is amusing. I would like to point out few things,

1) I am not claiming that *all* arranged marriages are forced. I have just stated how forced marriages do happen. Some people have taken it personally.  *I just feel it is projection*.
2) Many people are denying this, but it happens. A lot. To the point that it is so normalized that you don't feel it. *This is not a village thing. The friend I mentioned is from Mumbai*.
3) The ""I am a virgin, I want a virgin"". Okay, good for you, it's just, I feel that you are insecure about yourself. Atleast, that's how it looks like to me, as  a girl. (Oh, I am a *virgin* girl, so don't come at spewing shit like, ""You had sex that's why you don't want virginity to be considered""). If not, tell me why your partner's virginity matters to you, if it's not insecurity. It's a preference? Well, why is it? I mean, given the trend in the comments, most of you want to marry for sex. Which defiles marriage in itself, which you claim is sacred.
4) if calling me names, saying I am a weak shit for pointing out the obvious things happening in the society *and denying that it happens* makes you feel better, well, you do you. Classic ad hominem. Oh, you can say that I am generalising, and you know what, maybe I am, because generalizations always have a bit of truth of the society in them.
5) ""I won't get a good looking girl if I don't have an arranged marriage"". Oh my, that is so shallow. Just like a girl asking for 6 figures is wrong, then so is you asking for a good looking girl. Don't cry foul that women want money and gold diggers when you are just as shallow as them. I guess the quote should go, 'Don't judge a person until it's time for marriage'.
6) MARRIAGE IS NOT A CONTRACT AND DEFINITELY NOT A PASS FOR SEX. If you are marrying just for sex,   you are pitiful. Screams lack of confidence in yourself. People need to work on themselves, you don't get things you want just by sitting and hoping to get it. Since, most arguments are from men here, I have noticed that they are happy that they don't have to do anything and their parents get them a bride and sex while the bride gets 'financial security'. Reminds me of how you have to pay a prostitute to get sex, except here, it has a better name. 

Again, I would like to clear that I am against 'forced arranged marriages', though I am not a huge fan of the business like transaction of arranged marriages, what people want is none of concern. People have started bashing it as if I am totally against arranged marriage. Though, I have tried to counter the points which have been posted in defense of arranged marriage (and I didn't find them convincing). Though most of them argue about how arranged marriages are not bad, which I agree. *It's just how it happens here, is bad*. And I have tried to counter them too, though those have no relation to the whole point of the post. Which is how many are being forced into marriage and how it is so normalized in the present society.

Oof, formatting in reddit sucks. And I have realized that India has a *long, long* way to go. 

*Pretty ironic. A country in which romantic movies are usually the highest grossing, shuns love in real life.*

"Visiting India Hello everyone,

I am going to be visiting India soon for a business trip. I will be meeting up with our business friend, which is the reason for my visit. We will be in New Delhi, and I just have some random miscellaneous questions and I would enjoy talking to actual Indians instead of reading someone's travel blog. Above all, I want to make sure I'm not disrespectful to anyone.

Firstly, I am interested in doing some photography of my time here, both of the incredible buildings and of the culture. Is it considered disrespectful to do what we call ""street photography"" which is essentially taking pictures of the things, buildings, and people while walking around? What is the locals attitude towards a white guy like me walking around taking photographs?

Secondly, what are some good places to visit near New Delhi? I believe we will be going to the taj Mahal, and I would also like to go to red fort, humayuns tomb, etc. I know these are touristy, but I'm coming across the world and would like to see them.

If anyone has any questions for me I'd love to talk as well, it's always interesting to learn about others culture.",Photography

As you are already aware from the title, Yes, I am an coffee addict. I like to drink black coffee with no sugar, first thing in the morning.

"Excuse me, what the fuck! There have been reports (which I'll be linking at the end of this post) of AAP considering traveling for women by buses and metro to be completely free of cost. With a few months to go for assembly elections, this move by AAP seems more of desperate measure to rope in all the women voters.

Considering 25% percent of the riders to be women, the finances absolutely do not work out. There are already glaring issues regarding the safety of women and providing freebies is definitely not the way to go about it.

I have attached the annual report of DMRC which clearly shows that it is eventually finding its way to profitability. Making metro commute free for women will be a hugely regressive step in the existing scheme of things.

This proposal will not only fuck the DMRC finances but also the increase in footfall will be catastrophic for the management and also for the fellow commuters who are *paying* for the metro rides. I am an average randian and it took me a few minutes to predict the possibility of this glaring repercussion. Imagine the issues that will be discovered if this step is analyzed thoroughly.

"Not so frequently asked questions about NPR (yet) **What is this NPR I am suddenly hearing about?**

NPR stands for National Population Register. It was defined and explained in the Citizenship Rules, 2003 (see link below), which were formed to execute the Citizenship Amendment Act of 2003. The first data collection for the NPR happened along with the last census in 2010. The data was then updated in 2015.

**Who is affected by this?**

Every ""usual resident"" of India. If you generally live in an area in India (for past 6 months or more, or plan to live for next 6 months or more), you are required to provide the data. It covers you whether you are a citizen or not. On the other hand, citizens who are not normally resident (NRIs) are not covered.

**Oh, so it's like census in regards of who it covers and the way it is collected. What kind of data do they want?**

Some of the data is similar to the census form.

**Huh? But we already have the census for that. Why do we need this?**

Well, the census data collection comes under the Census act of 1948 and that data cannot be used for any other activity. The purpose of that data is to use it for planning and other welfare programs. It's confidential and anonymized.

The NPR data is collected under the Citizenship Act of 1955 and Citizenship Amendment Act of 2003. It won't be anonymized, nor will it be confidential. The purpose for this data is to help ascertain citizenship of an individual.

**What is different this time vs the 2010 collection?**

The differences are really the key. From a questionnaire taken from a pilot project that began in August, apparently you will now also need to tell the place of birth of your parents (do you have an idea of why they would need that? Wink, wink). This is a new data point and was not there in the original NPR (2010) data collection.

Also for the first time - you will be asked for numbers of your Aadhaar, driver's license, voter identity card, and mobile phone, if you have them. 

And did I tell you it's not planned to be anonymized or secured?

**Goodness! When is this happening?**

There was a gazette notification (see link below) issued in July 2019 by the government to prepare and update the Population Register in every state other than Assam. The field work will happen between April 1 and Sep. 30 of 2020. Expect a knock on your door then.

**But why are some people tying it to the NRC? It has nothing to do with that, right?**

Actually, the whole purpose of the National Population Register (NPR) is to collect the primary data for the National Register of Citizenship (NRC). This is really the first step. The NPR is supposed to create a list of all the residents of the country and then the NRC would take that list and identify people of “doubtful citizenship” – thus, by corollary creating a list of citizens."" (See the Rules document linked below)

**Hmm.. ""Doubtful citizenship"" sounds like a vague term. Who is going to determine that?**

Once you submit the data for the NPR, it will be verified for the purposes of preparation and inclusion in the NRC. The Local Registrar and their helper staff will scrutinize every single data point for each individual to come up with that decision. If they find that you citizenship is ""doubtful"" they will add a remark in the Population Register and inform you after the process is over.

**Don't tell me that “doubtful citizen” remark will really be used for the NRC.**

Come on. Of course it will be. We are not paying our Baabus for nothing. The final National Register of Citizens would be prepared by asking doubtful citizens to prove they are Indians as part of a “claims and objections” process.

**So, then it's my responsibility to remove the doubts of Sarkaari Baabus to be considered a citizen?**

Yes, but hey, you also have a right to cast doubt on others. A draft of the local register of the NRC will be publicly available. You can actually check your nosy neighbor's details and if your relationship is not cordial, can cast doubt on their information. You can object to the citizenship or a particular information of anyone before it goes into the final NRC. Of course, others can do that to you as well. But can't you pay a small price for .. erm.. eh.. the country?

"Suicidal Ex, Please Help me We met through tinder, She said she wanted a serious relationship, I also said okay, we started hooking up, I had strong feelings towards her, I liked her, when I started getting serious with her I started getting affected by retroactive jealously, I was suffering from that so much, I was new to the job so got busy with it, also we used to have frequent fights, I couldn't handle her anger, she abuses and go crazy when she is angry, she once mentioned she cut herself up when she and ex broke up, I got scared, I tried to talk to her how it  is not okay and she should consult a psychiatrist, she was not interested to talk about it, I started to withdraw slowly I couldn't handle it, I have never yelled or abused her, One day when her professor yelled at her, she said she wanted to talk, I was in office busy at work, I said I will call her later, she went crazy on how I don't care when she is hurting, she wanted to meet me every weekend, she started threatening me with suicide that day, I got so scared, apologized a million times, feel on her feet, she calmed down, that night she wanted food and said me to order, I was in the theatre with my friends, she again went crazy and said she would commit suicide because I won't care when she is hungry, I was begging her completely. It was manipulative, toxic, I wanted to breakup, she said if I can't handle her I should leave so I told I want to breakup, again she went crazy, she said she will kill herself and put the blame on me because I am breaking up without any reason and trying not solve the problems, again I started begging her and told her we will meet and solve the issues. We met, I told her about the problems, she also told how she felt, we decided we will solve the problems and try to get into a relationship if everything goes okay, it went well for 2 weeks, I spent the entire weekend with her, I thought she was enjoying it, last week she said she misses sexting and went to see the messages from her ex, I got angry I said if you are serious about this relationship as you say you would have told me that you missed that or atleast read our messages but you went to him, she again went crazy because I said ""you went to him"", she wanted to breakup because I was a bad boyfriend, I was not okay with PDA, I can never be crazy about someone, she got pissed when I said okay when she said we should breakup, again suicidal threats, I completely brokedown and cried and wanted to die, she calmed down. I talked to couple of psychiatrist they said she might be suffering from Borderline personality disorder and its not my responsibility to be her guardian, I met her 2 days back, begged her to come to Psychiatrist and I will pay for everything, she said no she only wanted a boyfriend, I said no and we brokeup. Today she says I am the one who is to blame because I used her and did not love her and she will punish herself for loving me, I said I will take steps to save two lives, she said she will kill herself if I went to cops or talked to her friends or parents about her psychiatric conditions, I was scared so I asked her to promise she won't take any stupid decisions so I won't got to police. No she said stay away from me and blocked me. What should I do please help me with next steps? What if she actually kills herself?

"(Serious) Need some advice, can't keep up. So, I am in 11th right now in some shitty CBSE school. I absolutely hate this school with a passion, always have and always will - God awful teachers, Autistic students, Just an all-out horrible place to be. I also go to a Coaching center that prepares for JEE Mains/Advanced, unlike my school, I actually like this place a lot. I'd much rather study in there than my poor excuse of a school.   


Getting to the point, I just can't keep up with work from both the School and my Coaching classes. To a point where I'd it's affecting me mentally. I just wish to study for the JEE at the coaching center where I have pretty damn good teachers and students that don't have their frontal lobe missing, don't wish to hassle with Schoolwork that has absolutely no worth whatsoever. Are there any options for me? Maybe being a Private candidate or going to an Open school? I am already a month in, took PCMCS, got a terrible 72% in 10th. Life seems pretty hopeless right now

Hi,

Looking to purchase a laptop for programming, watching movies and browse the web. The following configuration seem good, just needed reviews for the same.

 The Asus one seems to have a bad panel but people who own the laptop how bad is it?

The Hp one has a 3 cell battery, IPS LED backlit panel on paper this should translate as better battery life and better display but does it? 

I  can't find information regarding if the HP laptop allows storage to be updated or the SSD is soldered to the laptop. 

The Acer laptop seems good on paper any comments on how good or bad it is ?

&amp;#x200B;

I plan to dual boot have Ubuntu and Windows 10. Any driver issues for Ubuntu I need to be aware off ?

The old laptop I had had a Broadcom Wifi &amp; Bluetooth modules had issues with Ubuntu and needed a bit of effort to get them working.

How is the battery back up of all 3 laptops on Ubuntu ?

Please don't suggest me to get a Mac as the Mac's I am looking for are far far away from my budget.  :(",AskIndia

"Why Russia in the Revolution of 1905 is analogous to India today Russia in 1905 was controlled by a very hated Tsar. He was in control only because he controlled the police and media. The courts were also controlled by him and thus no real justice was possible. 

Ring a bell? Read on. 

He ruled only for the vested big industry and land owners. They made policies and he simply was their puppet. Farmers were in distress and yes you also had farmer suicide but the Tsar didn't care because his sycophants told him he was the best Tsar ever and that the Economy and people were in great shape?

 Ding ding ding. 

Now in 1904 and 1905 began a series of mass democratic protests, all inorganic and a will of the people. Did the Tsar listen to them? No, he ignored them at best and at worst unleashed his army and police on unarmed masses murdering them by the 1,000's. 

You have made the connection haven't you. 

As this was all making the Tsar look bad, a group of fascists called the Black Hundreds, supported by the police came up. Like the RSS today they were a fascist mob who used the support of the state to silence dissenting voices by violence. Now go read about them and you will see that they mirror the RSS exactly. A summary from Wikipedia. 

>The Black Hundreds were also noted for extremism and incitement to pogroms, nationalistic Russocentric doctrines, different xenophobic beliefs, including anti-Ukrainian sentiment[4] and anti-semitism.

Replace russocentric with Hindutva and anti Ukrainian with Bangladesh and semitism with Islam and you have the exact same Ideology. 

Whenever a peaceful protest came up, these thugs will show up, murder the peace loving protestors while the police turned a blind eye. 

This is exactly the same as India under the Fascist thug Modi.  

I do hope that the people rise up and eventually overthrow him, restoring the rule of democracy we had before him.",Policy/Economy

"What has been you worst food/meal experience when travelling within India? I had went to see Elephanta caves 2 months ago. There I had a meal at the Maharashtra government's restaurant at the top near the entry to the caves. It has been my worst experience ever. 
We went there and ordered immediately. They had a relatively small/decent menu but most of the things were not available. We ordered Panner Bhurji and Chicken Keema. 
It took 30-35 minutes before the sabzis arrived and then further 4-5 minutes for rotis. 
The chicken had so much black pepper, you could not even taste the chicken. Then we tried Paneer and it was now lemon instead of pepper (Or maybe Panner had turned foul). It was awful.",Food

"Crimes in Delhi Hi guys,

I am sorry if this post doesn't belong here or If it sounds like a rant but just 2 days back, I just came to know that my cousin's dad was attacked brutally by 2-3 goons in Dwarka at night when he was returning from work on his bicycle. He got off the metro at around 12am at night and was on his way home when he was stopped and beaten mercilessly. The goons didn't rob him and stopped only when they saw a PCR van approaching.

He is in the hospital now and had multiple scans done and is now scheduled for jaw surgery. This is truly heartbreaking for me as their family is really nice. They are a family of three, all of them highly educated, hardworking  and soft spoken people. He returns late from work everyday and rides his bike from the metro station to home even though he has a car just to stay fit while also reduce carbon emissions from his side.

The police doesn't seem to be helping much and are treating it as ""just another everyday case"", like this is normal and expected at Delhi streets. And ofcourse I expect nothing ever to happen to the people who did this, and I am pretty sure they wont get caught.

Just wanted to put this out there, stay safe people and care for your loved ones, you never know what could can happen on the streets of New Delhi.",Scheduled

"Delhi has not been given a single paisa from the ₹17,000 crore allocated to states. Here's why Hi there!

As is being reported by the news, approximately ₹17,000 crore has been allocated by the Centre to the States. Here is a representative news report: [""Centre grants Rs 17,000cr to states to tackle coronavirus crisis"", Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/centre-grants-rs-17000cr-to-states-to-tackle-coronavirus-crisis/articleshow/74975956.cms)

Of this ₹17,000 crore, ₹11,092 crore is the Union's contribution to the ""State Disaster Response Mitigation Funds (SDRMFs)"" and the rest is as a ""Revenue Deficit Grant"".

**Tl;dr:** The short answer on why Delhi didn't see a single paisa of this money is because the Fifteenth Finance Commission (XV-FC) has not included Delhi in its recommendations. This is because Delhi is not a state. The Finance Commission, a constitutional body, deals with financial relations between the Union Government and State Governments.

**Deep Dive:**

The XV-FC recommended creation of a new “disaster mitigation and response fund” 💰 at Union (NDRMF) and State levels (SDRMFs).

These new funds are distinct from the O.G. 😎 'National Disaster Response Fund' (NDRF) and SDRFs under the Disaster Management Act, 2005. The NDRF and SRDFs are for ""*meeting expenses for emergency response, relief, and rehabilitation due to any threatening disaster situation or disaster.*”

The NDRMF and SDRMF are for *""local level and community-based interventions which reduce risks and promote environmentally-friendly settlements and livelihood practices.*"" Large scale mitigation will continue to be addressed by broad developmental programs and policies of the Union and State Governments.

*Note 1*: The difference here lies in the words **response** (NDRF/SDRF) and **mitigation** (NDRMF/SDRMF). Mitigation is pre-disaster. Mitigation actions reduce or eliminate the loss of life and property by lessening the impact of disasters.

*Note 2*: The NDRMF/SDRMF are statutory (legal) funds under the Disaster Management act, 2005 📝. Just like the NDRF and SDRFs.

*Note 3*: the Supreme Court 👨‍⚖ , in 2016, in an act of judicial activism (🙄) directed the creation of a National Disaster Mitigation Fund (NDMF) and state SDMFs. This was criticized a lot cause the court’s got no business in the executive 💼 working. This direction was not followed by most governments in India, and has remained a non-starter 🚫

Similarly, the approximately ₹6000 crore of Revenue-Deficit Grants are only for state governments.

Source: 15th Finance Commission Report 2020-21. Pages 34, 35, 55, 56, and 99. [Accessible here](https://fincomindia.nic.in/writereaddata/html_en_files/oldcommission_html/fincom15/XVFC_202021%20Report_English_Web.pdf), at the Finance Commission's website.

**Edit and Update:** It seems that an inherent fact is being overlooked by people in the comments. The Union’s devolution under the XV-FC’s recommendations is a *constitutional obligation* and was meant to happen regardless of the Coronavirus epidemic. It also seems that people are (rightly so) peeved at red-tape because effectively the Government of Delhi does not get funds to combat this crisis. Some possible financing mechanisms that I’ve elaborated in the comments section are:

* Further Union contributions to Delhi’s SDRF (most effective)
* Making funds available from the Union Home Affairs Ministry (improbable given constrained budgets)
* Ways and Means Advances from RBI (30 day credit limit)
* Union spending through New Delhi Municipal Corporation (limited geographical spread)
* Municipal Bonds (underdeveloped and tight credit)
* Allocations from PMNRF and PM-CARES
* Donation drives from citizens and civil society",Coronavirus

Hi Reddit India, thanks a lot for inviting me for this AMA! A brief intro about myself: Thithi is my debut fiction feature film as director, and is currently playing in theatres across India. I am also the author of an English novel called ""It's Raining in Maya"". Before making Thithi I made twelve short films, and grew up writing poetry and pursuing photography. I am thrilled to be here with my filmmaking soul-mate in many ways; the DoP for THITHI, the amazingly multi-talented filmmaker from Holland, Doron Tempert. Looking forward to chatting with you all; ask us anything! 

Hey everyone, thanks for making this such an amazing AMA, and thank you Reddit India for having us. It was very stimulating for the both of us, and is getting us more excited about our future work. Signing off with the reminder that Thithi is playing in theatres all over Karnataka and in Mumbai, Delhi, Pune and Chennai! We're hoping to come to other cities in the coming week. Please try and catch it on the big screen before it leaves theatres, the experience leads to a far more immersive willing suspension of disbelief :) Thanks again hope you all have a great night!",Photography

"AMA Announcement: Aatish Taseer, writer, journalist. December 27th, 9:30 PM IST (i.e. today!) Hello r/India,

Most of you are probably already familiar with Aatish and his writing. We invited him for an AMA and he agreed to do it. Aatish will be with us to answer questions and share his opinions on politics, the ongoing citizenship protests in India among other things. 

In case you are not familiar with his work please find some details below:

> Taseer was born in London to politician and businessman Salman Taseer (who was born in British India to a British mother and Indian father, the latter became Pakistani at partition) and Indian journalist Tavleen Singh. His parents never married, he was raised by his mother and had no contact with his father until he was aged 21. He was raised in New Delhi, before attending Kodaikanal International School, a residential school in Kodaikanal.  Taseer later studied at Amherst College  in Massachusetts, earning dual Bachelor of Arts degrees in French and Political Science in 2001.  In his first book Stranger to History (2009), which received many reviews in India, he wrote about his estrangement from his father who was a governor of the Punjab province in Pakistan

> Aatish Taseer became a contributing opinion writer for The International New York Times in the fall of 2015.
> He is the author, most recently, of “The Way Things Were,” which The Los Angeles Review of Books described as “the best Indian novel of the last decade.”
> His other books are “Stranger to History: A Son’s Journey Through Islamic Lands,” a Costa-shortlisted first novel, “The Temple-Goers,” and the highly acclaimed “Noon.” He has written for The Wall Street Journal, The Financial Times and The Sunday Times, London, among other publications.

> On 8 November 2019, Taseer's Overseas Citizenship of India was revoked by the Indian Ministry of Home Affairs claiming he attempted to ""conceal information that his father was of Pakistani origin"". Taseer has said this is untrue, he never concealed the identity of his father with whom he had no contact and his mother was always he only legal guardian as a minor. Taseer alleged that the ministry didn't give him enough time and that it was an act of reprisal. In his May 2019 cover article for Time magazine, published during the Indian election entitled ""India’s divider in chief"" he was highly critical of the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi. He told The Guardian that his citizenship issue had not caused him any problems before the Time article was published. The Home ministry rejected the claim that the Time article had any connection to the rejection of Taseer's citizenship.

> Taseer's first book Stranger to History: A Son's Journey Through Islamic Lands (2009), His part memoir-part travelogue, has been translated into more than 14 languages and hailed as a ""must-read"" for anyone attempting to understand the Muslim world. Taseer's well received translation of Saadat Hasan Manto's short stories from the original Urdu, Manto: Selected Stories, was published in 2008.

The AMA is scheduled for 27th December, 9:30 PM IST. 

Please be there!

The taxes on Petrol and Diesel have grown by over 100% in the tenure of Modi government. While the other big economies are trying to ensure that they do not go in economic slump by easing their monetary policy, India is busy dampening consumer confidence.

This news closely follows another one where the Modi government fired Urjit PATEL for not financing 1.56L crores worth of government expenditure.

The markets are reeling heavily downwards under pressure due to C scare, and it is very likely that the investors will pull out their investments from higher risk based emerging economies. In a looming recession, the growth can flee and the institutional investors may pull out in hoards.

The Indian banks are failing and the modi government is further dampening the consumer confidence by raising taxes on staple like Petrol. The recent drop in oil prices was perfect opportunity for the government to announce a reduction. 

In the times needing economic rescue via freer monetary measures , the government has chosen to play out a decision lacking economic prudence.",Policy/Economy

"1st year ECE graduate who again wants to give Jee Mains. I'm confused and in need of help. Please, I literally don't have anyone to talk with about this thing which is eating my head. 

I passed 12th in 2018, and gave jee for the 1st time. Faired miserably and repeated a year and again gave it in 2019. Again didn't study properly and faired badly. Got into an okay okay private college called Heritage Institute of Technology in Kolkata. I'm studying ECE(Electronics and communication engineering) out there.

I've always wanted to study Computer science. With that in mind, I started trying to study discrete math from online resources. However, after finding the road too steep, I gave up. I thought, it'll be better to get a CS degree.

With that in mind, I decided to write Jee again.

In a private college, cracking GATE is my best option to go to a better place, but I doubt if I'll be capable enough to crack it and get into a better college. So I thought, better to write Jee again and try and get some private college with better placement opportunity so that I won't always be in uncertainty over my future.

But now, I don't know if this is the best decision. I don't know what to do. Whether to give up with Jee or continue. I sometimes feel embarrassed to give the exam again. I hate myself, my choices. I don't really know what I want from life. It's like I'm just doing things, not going anywhere - life has no direction.

### Tl;dr

IFF has written an open letter to Justice A.P. Shah and shared a copy of it with the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI). In it we have expressed our concerns of self censorship beginning to permeate across online video platforms. We have sent this as a response to three recent developments. First, the Government filed a counter affidavit before the Supreme Court last month in which it endorsed self-regulatory institutional mechanisms for domains like social media. Second, the Minister of Information & Broadcasting Prakash Javadekar met with industry players setting a 100 day timeline for market participants to agree on a code of conduct and adjudicatory mechanism. Third, Hotstar India’s largest online curated content providers banned an episode of Last Week Tonight which dedicated an 18 minute segment to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Therefore, we have written to Justice Shah to take cognizance of these developments and the risk the IAMAI’s self regulation code poses to people’s right to receive and impart information.

### Background

In early February 2020, the Internet and Mobile Association of India launched a new Code for Self Regulation of Online Curated Content Providers. Among other things it sought to establish a second tier oversight mechanism under the aegis of a Digital Content Complaint Council (“DCCC”). The DCCC has been constituted in a manner which is eerily similar to the Broadcast Content Complaints Council (“BCCC”) which is the relevant self-regulatory oversight mechanism for television in India. Notably, the BCCC and the accompanying self-regulation code operates parallel to statutorily recognised content norms for cable television. When such parallel frameworks subsist it is likely that content creation, removal and censorship decisions err on the side of caution. As we all know, India’s TV ecosystem has aligned itself to be a risk averse space where content remains homogeneous and its quality pales in comparison to global creative economies.

We have studied the IAMAI’s self regulation framework and many of the same problems that we see with respect to TV come up in this context as well. It establishes vague prohibited content norms which go beyond constitutional thresholds and provisions under relevant laws like the Information Technology Act, 2000 and the Indian Penal Code, 1860. In addition we are concerned with the way that the framework has been designed in an exclusionary manner, the scope and applicability of the DCCC and its interactions with government in particular, and limited actual considerations of the public’s right to free speech and expression.

We believe it is likely to translate into a paradigm where there will be excessive self censorship which will plague India’s online content space. At a broader level we believe it will lead to an overarching chilling effect which will mean that certain types of content will not get made and it will lead to a body blow for plurality and diversity in India’s fledgling online content ecosystem. Sensing these concerns we have already written to the [**IAMAI** ](https://internetfreedom.in/online-video-streaming-and-tv-are-not-the-same-so-why-is-the-iamai-trying-to-make-it-so/)and the touted chairperson of the proposed DCCC, the former Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court, [**Justice A.P. Shah**](https://internetfreedom.in/a-gentle-open-letter-to-justice-a-p-shah-on-the-online-video-self-regulatory-code/). In it we have articulated our aforementioned concerns with the framework.

Subsequent developments since then reinforce our trepidation with the DCCC and the IAMAI’s self regulation code. To be sure, the Code has only five signatories who have developed the code in conjunction with the IAMAI in an opaque manner-- with no inputs from external stakeholders. The exclusionary nature of the Code is magnified by the fact that the online curated content space in India has more than 35 payers. Therefore, it is concerning that the Indian Government has started taking steps to formalise industry wide adoption and endorse such parallel frameworks which fuel self censorships.

### Latest Developments

In an ongoing matter on online content regulation, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) filed a counter affidavit filed before the Supreme Court of India. In it MIB [**endorsed**](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/self-regulation-model-may-work-for-ott-companies-govt/articleshow/74410087.cms) a self-regulatory institutional mechanism for other domains like social media. This concerns us because it seems like there is a slippery slope brewing which could lead to a chilling effect spreading across major online platforms (both which are fully curated and those which are semi-curated).

Additionally, a [**report**](https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/mumbai/cover-story/curb-your-ott-instincts/articleshow/74449516.cms) in the Mumbai Mirror dated March 03, 2020 revealed that the Union Minister for Information and Broadcasting Mr Prakash Javadekar met with online content industry representatives. In the meeting, the Minister gave the representatives a 100-day timeline by when they must arrive at a consensus on an industry code of conduct and an appropriate adjudicatory mechanism. This is clearly indicative of a risk that the Government may be pushing other segments of the industry to become signatories to the IAMAI Code and come under the jurisdiction of the DCCC. If this happens we could be fast heading to a restrictive online content space along the lines of how it functions in the Indian television ecosystem.

Our concerns self-censorship were of course exacerbated by the recent incident in which Hotstar, one of the primary signatories to the IAMAI’s self regulation code, proactively [**banned**](https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/hotstar-blocks-john-olivers-last-week-tonight-episode-criticising-narendra-modi/article30920096.ece) an episode of Last Week Tonight with John Oliver which was centred on Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

### What have we written?

Given these multiple developments we have written to Justice A.P. Shah outlining these incidents and how it ties up with our stance on the IAMAI self-regulation code. We have urged the concerned parties to revisit their current positions and will follow up with them to consider avenues through which self-regulation does not become a gateway to trample upon people’s freedom of speech and expression, overall creativity, diversity and plurality. To this end, we have shared with both Justice Shah and the IAMAI Governing Council links to a recent report by [**Access Now**](https://www.accessnow.org/guide-how-to-protect-human-rights-in-content-governance/) which looks at different models of online content governance. The report also examines self-regulation and outlines certain key principles in ensuring such systems do not violate human rights.

IFF will continue to continue to engage with the subject, and fight towards ensuring self-regulation does not become a means for collateral censorship.

"My OnePlus 5's screen broke. How do I backup all my files on it? Also conflicted for a future phone purchase.. hi.. due to a small accident yesterday, I broke my OnePlus5. The screen is shattered, and the back panel has a small bend on it. However, the phone is surprisingly still working cause alarms and incoming calls are ringing. I would like to take a backup of all my files and media content on it. I remember that when I connect my phone to a computer it normally goes only in charging mode, and not into UBS mode which I have to manually select on the phone. Is there a manner for me to copy my content while the display is not working?

Additionally, I am looking to buy a new phone and on account of my great experience with OnePlus so far, I am inclined towards OnePlus 6t which is for 27999 INR or OP7 (non Pro) which is for 32999 INR.. Which would you recommend, as I understand that 6T has dual cameras but 7 only depth sensor and a camera... I don't want to spend money on the OP7Pro which is 52999 INR

"Let's discuss the state of Indian intelligence agencies in terms of cyber power. While almost every week there is a story or another about the NSA, CIA, GHCQ invading the privacy of the citizens, launching attacks against cyber criminals, putting people on certain _lists_ for using Tor etc.,  Indian intelligence agencies have been off the radar. I have a strong feeling that it's not because they choose to, but because they lack the skills.

Why do you think that is?  The NSA, SIS, GHCQ, FBI etc. make it a point to hire top security professionals and even hire interns directly from universities. The candidates selected consider it as a good career path, both in terms of serving the nation and in terms of intellectual satisfaction. Compare it with the state in India, where RAW and IB don't even have a dedicated website. I understand the need for secrecy, but at least have a fucking portfolio! One cannot even directly apply to RAW. One needs to join some other government department and then one gets transferred. (like seriously?). Just have a look at [NSA](https://www.intelligencecareers.gov/nsa/), [GHCQ](https://www.gchq-careers.co.uk/recruitment-process.html), [FBI] (http://www.fbiagentedu.org/careers/cyber-crimes/), [SIS](https://www.sis.gov.uk/science-and-technology.html) career websites and then look at Indian [IB's](http://mha.nic.in/vacancies) (No, there isn't even a webpage specific to IB and like I said, one cannot directly get into RAW). Would a person who is **actually** skilled even want to apply or work here? I don't think so.

I believe that India has not paid enough attention to strengthening its cyber power. I believe that we need to have some _Kevin Mitnick_ sort of personalities to wreak havoc on the cyber security front by unlawful activities. (Instead of fakers like Ankit Fadia). Why?

* There's huge money to be made in it.
* The Indian intelligence agencies won't be able to catch you (unskilled that I think they are).
* Even if they figure out you were behind it, you could easily hide in the 1.252 billion population that India has. 
* The infrastructure to attack is highly outdated and vulnerable (For instance [this](https://www.troyhunt.com/43-203-indian-patient-pathology-reports-were-left-publicly-exposed-by-health-solutions/).).

My worst fear is that if there is a war in the future, it will be a cyber war, and India will be left devastated. It's not that we don't have the skills, it's just that the government needs a slap on its face. Like seriously, our government needs to change. How can a few babulog sitting behind desks who have no clue about technology properly shape the laws concerning cyber security and privacy? Why can't our leaders debate about such technical issues during election campaigns (like Hillary and Trump did) ? They don't because they don't feel such issues are important enough. Like I said before, we need some big hacks to happen in order to stir things up.",Science/Technology

"Indian Judiciary - Boon or Curse Recently I paid 22k to a company for a service. I connected to them through social media and the compnay is from a different state than me. They did not provide good service and even failed to fulfill their certain condition which in turn made it eligable to claim refund. Now, I went to consumer court, tried cyber crime department, police department and all the possible ways to get my refund but there is no result. 
When I approached one of the well known advocate of my city he advised me not go the judiciary way. 
In India, (Civil) decisions are so prolonged that it is really of no use. As it is said that justice delayed is justice denied. There are numerous cases where someone has illegally occupied somebody else's property and the case is going on for years. 
So imagine the cost of property is 1 million and to get the occupancy you need to invest 25 thousand is a good deal. Now you can invest 50 thousand every year to prolong the case. It is quite cheaper than actually renting the property. Secondly the owner has to also bear the same cost just to fight back or else in most of the cases people prefer not to fight and give away such property.",AskIndia

"A reality check on tax rates So many people I know have a very poor understanding of marginal tax rates. They think that if you fall in the 20% bracket, ALL your income is taxed at 20%

Here is a reality check. In these calculations, I'm assuming that you have maximized 80c savings of 1.5L

If you make 12L/year, you would pay 1.32L as tax. Your effective tax rate is just ~11%

If you make 20L/year, you would pay 3.82L. Your effective tax rate is just 19.1%

If you make 40L/year, you would pay 10L. Your effective tax rate is just 25.1%

You would have to make 60L/year to get close to 30% tax rate

If you're making 60L per year, you're well off in most of the world (barring outliers like San Francisco) and fabulously well off in India. Does 30% tax rate really hurt you that much?

I'm personally within this tax range and I don't mind paying the money. It's a standard practice across the world for independent contractors like me to keep 30% of any money made aside for taxes.

Keep this in mind. The last majority of people would cap out under 20% tax rate",Business/Finance

"Hydroponics and Agtech Entrepreneurship in India | Dhrav Khanna, Triton Foodworks For the last 10 years, I have spent the majority of my time looking at sustainability as a function of  urbanization, and the resource footprints of urban residents, in Asia.

Particularly how will Asia' urban systems be challenges by the movement of the next two billion Asians moving into cities (by 2030), and what the role of entrepreneurs and innovators will be as THE force to deliver the solutions required for sustainability in local environments, economies, and communities.

So, while the news surrounding Chennai's water shortage are now top of mind, and in keeping in mind there are dozens of other cities in India that are under similar threat, earlier this year I met with an amazing entrepreneur named Dhrav Khanna of Delhi based Triton Foodworks and interviewed him about his work.

It was an amazing discussion, similar to those I have had in Bangkok, Singapore, and Hong Kong, and while I was impressed by his systems, and saw similar challenges in business model, the one thing I really appreciated was in his approach to measuring how much water his systems saved again traditional farming.

The interview is around 20 minutes, so it is not short, but if you are an Indian looking for examples of individuals who are solving local problems using local innovation, this is a great interview and I hope you will share this with your networks.

"Modi and Adani Relation | Lobbying and Crony Capitalism | **Modi-Adani Relation** 


When Adani’s son was married in Goa is 2013, guest list included the richest man in the country and many a chief executive and top banker and bureaucrat. Most, however, just stopped by the night before to bless the happy couple and skipped the actual wedding. But one prominent friend stayed through all the ceremonies over a couple of days, genial and relaxed like a favorite uncle. It was Narendra Modi, chief minister of Adani's home state of Gujarat.

In 2003,  Modi, the chief minister of Gujarat, was taken to task by the Confederation of Indian Industry for the anti-Muslim riots in the state. Leading the charge were prominent industrialists like Rahul Bajaj and Jamshyd Godrej. The CII's attack on Modi provoked an angry reaction by a group of Gujarati industrialists, who organised themselves under the Resurgent Gujarat Group. Adani and Mehta were the leading lights of the RGG, which took on the CII on Modi's behalf. The CII was forced to apologise to the chief minister.

His wealth has more than quadrupled since Modi announced his candidacy in September 2013, the biggest gain among the country’s elite. He travelled with Modi to US, Australia, Bhutan, Brazil, Japan, France and China. After most of Modi’s foreign visits, Adani bagged business agreement from these countries.

The rates at which the Adani Group bagged land from the Narendra Modi-led Gujarat government for its port and special economic zone (SEZ) project — between Re 1 and Rs 32 per square metre — were much lower than other companies that set up units in the state.  Tata Motors was given 1,110 acres for its Nano car plant in Sanand (near Ahmedabad) at Rs 900 per sq mt, Ford India paid at Rs 1,100 per sq mt for 460 acres close by, while India’s largest carmaker, Maruti Suzuki, bought about 700 acres in Hansalpur at Rs 670 per sq mt. Among other industrial groups, K Raheja Corp was sold land at Rs 470 per sq mt, while TCS had to pay at Rs 1,100 per sq mt and Torrent Power at Rs 6,000 per sq mt.

Special Economic Zones Rules, 2016, were amended by the department of commerce, to insert a provision on claims for refund under the Special Economic Zones Act, 2005. The SEZ Act under which the SEZ Rules are framed did not initially provide any provision for refunds of any kind before this amendment was introduced. The Adani Power Ltd. has claimed that it has paid customs duty on raw ¬materials and consumables – that is, coal imported for the generation of electricity. However, documents leaked to the EPW clearly indicate that the APL had not, in fact, paid the duty on raw materials and consumables amounting to approximately Rs 1,000 crore that had fallen due at the end of March 2015. It appears at face value that by amending the SEZ Rules to insert a provision for companies to claim refunds on customs duty, the department of commerce is ¬allowing the Adani Power Ltd. to claim refunds on the duty that has never been paid by it in the first place [Source-Wire.in](https://thewire.in/149156/modi-government-adani-group/)

Ironically, the biggest black money case that has come up before the SIT so far is that of the Adani group. The Adani group allegedly took out over Rs 5,000 crore to tax havens, using inflated bills for the import of power equipment from South Korea and China, the SIT on black money was told by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED). The Adani group vehemently denies any wrongdoing. Modi, after his rhetoric-filled ride to power, has been silent. Since Modi’s ascension to office, what has happened in the ED, which had registered a preliminary case against Adani in Ahmedabad and was handed details of DRI findings, is illustrative. The officer heading the Ahmedabad branch of the directorate was raided by the CBI, which accused him of possessing disproportionate assets. It failed to prove anything at all, despite months of investigation. The two senior-most officers in the Mumbai regional office, who oversaw the investigations in Ahmedabad, were forced out of the agency. The tenure of Rajan S. Katoch, who was heading the directorate when the case was opened, also ended abruptly. Apart from the Adani case, the Ahmedabad ED investigators were also pursuing some of the biggest money launderers of Gujarat.[Source-Wire.in](https://thewire.in/58640/black-money-investigation-a-feast-of-vultures/)",Business/Finance

"Randians who can’t tolerate spicy food, how do you manage living outside? No one in my family has decent spice tolerance. How do I explain it, not only I feel burning sensation in my mouth and chest but it also feels uncomfortable after eating & I have a hard time digesting it. Maybe it’s because of genetics. By spice I don’t mean just chilli but other spices too.

Back in home, all things are cooked without spices. Wedding ceremonies become a nightmare sometimes. Fortunately, I’ve a sweet tooth to make up for it and enjoy sweet things in general. 

After 12th I moved out and went to Kota for medical preparation. And food in my hostel was absolute nightmare (but average according to others), I suffered from acidity & sickness the entire year. Situation didn’t improve all even in my college life with the limited things I can eat. Also, I can’t eat outside with the few friends I have, unless it’s McDonald’s or KFC, which is rare since most of time they hang out, they always prefer dinner at some restaurant instead. Eating just Hakka noodles & salad isn’t worth it.

Edit: *I’ve read that our taste buds and nerves use various proteins (called TRP channels) to detect various substances that give most spices their distinctive taste. Most of these proteins are activated by many different spices. Our spice tolerance depends on our genetics, people have mutations of these proteins which influence our final sensation of spices since most food have blend of different spices. People who have TRPV1 protein mutated they’re less susceptible to capsaicin in chillies (chemical compound that causes burning sensation after eating chilli).*",Food

There is a quote in the movie Interstellar:

*”We’ve always defined ourselves by the ability to overcome the impossible. And we count these moments. These moments when we dare to aim higher, to break barriers, to reach for the stars, to make the unknown known. We count these moments as our proudest achievements. But we lost all that.
Or perhaps we’ve just forgotten that we are still pioneers. And we’ve barely begun. And that our greatest accomplishments cannot be behind us, because our destiny lies above us”*

So i bought Samsung evo 860 and tried to replace but laptop didn't detected the ssd. This time i went to different shopkeeper and gave it to him and he told me the hard disk connector was damaged and i have to change that and after 2 days he bought the connector and this time he told me that it got short-circuit and there is some other issue. He took 2 week to give me the update and gave me the update that motherboard is having some issues and now i have to replace whole motherboard.

2.nicest firm reputation(good reputation among customers and employees, be it products, services or firm culture)

3.highest general quality(best quality confirmed by many, may be the luxury in respective industry)

4.longest firm history(origins of industries, still competing and has a special place)

5.strongest innovative capability(largest R&amp;D spending, most patents, products, designs etc)

6.widest world coverage(can be found in almost any country, consumed by all types of people)

7.best price-performance ratio(manages to balance cost, price and performance nicely, known for best-value-for-money)

8.fastest firm development(fastest expansion in the industry, may be the young but competitive type)

9.greatest social influence(most influential firm or community culture, participate in many social activities)

"Anatomy Of An Accident: How 29 Lives Were Lost Because Of Sleep Deprivation A bus fell down 40 feet from Yamuna Expressway in to a nala taking the lives of 29 people and injuring 27 others.

The bus was being driven at a speed of 120 km/hr. There is supposed to be a speed governor in state run buses. In this one there wasn’t.

The bus driver was driving his first big route. He didn’t know the route well enough and thus, he detoured twice causing delay. He was driving fast to make up for that lost time. Generally, there is supposed to be a team of two drivers for such journeys. Here there wasn’t. Only one driver driving alone. Add to it, he was tired and sleepy. He had been driving all night.

The passengers report telling him to stop and wash his face with water. He did so only 20 minutes before the accident. He continued thereafter and the next time he dozed, they all fell.

It’s not all grim a story. A villager called Nihal witnessed the accident, jumped into the drain, broke open the glass windows and rescued two to three passengers. He was the one to call the police as well as alert fellow villagers to help come rescue. Nihal is a hero.

However, this wasn’t just a freak accident. There were no two vehicles bumping into each other because of a technical snag. There were no animals suddenly crossing the Expressway. There was simply a driver tired and sleepy from driving the whole of the night. One who didn’t quite know the route and one who was speeding to reach in time. And despite specific guidelines particularly designed to avoid such accidents, a non-following of the same leading to the deaths of many.

The government has announced a compensation of Rs. 5 lakhs each to the family of the deceased and Rs. 2.5 lakhs to those injured. An investigation committee has been set up. Officials will be now be involved to figure out what seems to be staring us right in the face.

Road travel is dangerous. It is made more so by overworked sleep deprived drivers who could really use a partner driver or perhaps a nap.

And the thing is I travel a lot by bus and I would like to not think about it much but I do. For the system by design wants me to completely put my life in the hands of another. Accidents can happen but the least one expects is to not die because someone didn't get proper sleep.

"TIL a US company owned by Princely Family of Liechtenstein tried to patent ""Basmati Rice"". The US Patent Office granted a broad patent in 1997 but it was eventually watered down after India challenged the patent and threatened a WTO dispute. Company Rice Tec : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RiceTec

**Source** : https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1143209

> THE FACTS
> 
> * Originally from India and Pakistan, Basmati became a controversial ‘issue’ after RiceTec, a Texas-based company, in 1997, patented some types of rice they developed as “American basmati”.
> * RiceTec Inc, had been trying to enter the international Basmati market with brands like “Kasmati” and “Texmati”. Ultimately, the company claimed to have developed a new strain of aromatic rice by interbreeding basmati with another variety. They sought to call the allegedly- new variety as Texmati or American Basmati.
> * RiceTec Inc, was issued the Patent number 5663484 on Basmati rice lines and grains on September 2, 1997.
> * This was objected to by two Indian nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) — Centre for Food Safety, an international NGO that campaigns against biopiracy, and the Research Foundation for Science, Technology and Ecology, an Indian environmental NGO who filed legal petitions in the United States. The Centre for Scientific and Industrial Research also
> objected to it.
> * They sought trade protection for basmati rice of the Indian subcontinent and jasmine rice of
> Thailand. They demanded amendment of U.S. rice standards to specify that the term “basmati” can be used only for rice grown in India and Pakistan, and jasmine for the Thai rice.
> * The Indian government, after putting together the evidence, officially challenged the patent in June 2000.

"Kota District Collector's letter to the parents of IIT aspirants [NP] Dear Parents,

On behalf of Kota City, I take this opportunity to welcome your child to a city of wonders which processes the young minds of this country and fuels their passion to become the architects of Modern India.

My humble request at the beginning of this letter is to read this with some patience and time and it would be ideal if both the parents can read this together.

It is the dream of every parent to see his child touch the pinnacles of success and reach places which only few can afford. Every parent plants a seed in the mind of the child which over a period of time bears fruits but after careful nourishment and tendering since the seed is so tender that any mishandling may fail us from realizing our dream.

It is a very difficult situation for parents to leave their child in a place where they do not live and things become still difficult when the purpose for which the child is left behind is for dedicated and committed efforts in scaling excellence in education.

When parents look at the huge billboard signage/hoarding/ newspaper clips depicting pictures of young beautiful children who have achieved what they dream for their child, the resolution to inspire and motivate their children becomes still stronger.

Good career in the field of Engineering & Medicine, as the case may be, is more or less like certain insurance in terms of decent earning and living standards. I sincerely think that in most of the cases, this is the very reason that makes us dream such careers for our children.

There is nothing wrong in thinking on a certain kind of Assured Career Insurance for one’s child since limited resources and high degree of competition demands one to think ahead of times.

However, I think we all agree that the world too has changed drastically in the last 15-20 years so much so, that most of the facilities and services that were available for a limited few are now available to many due to the huge progress in technology which was witnessed in this period.

Art, Entertainment, Professional Sports, Literature, Health & Fitness, Entrepreneurship, Journalism, Photography, Event management, Music, Adventure, Destination tourism, etc, to name a few too witnessed immense growth in comparison to the bygone era.

Many of these even created a new niche which not just nurtured creative potential of the human mind and its capabilities but also were very successful career options.

Well, the point is not about asking you to see them as better options but certainly to see them also as options.

It is a matter of fact that today, young children are facing immense amount of pressure relating to their academic performance and due to the same many of them go through various levels of stress.

Even if we consider that a certain element of stress would exist in competition parental support, care and the right kind of family situations would help the child to cope with any difficult situation.

However, current reality is that due to the lack of right kind of conditions and support systems, many children are going through stress uncared and unattended for and in a few cases such situations disabled the children to such an extreme extent that they committed suicide…

Don’t get frightened suddenly as to what is being said about your child… Your child is perfectly safe and sound and you have no reasons to worry, but you have reasons to have concern of your child which I believe you will understand as we read my letter further.

I consider myself a very unfortunate person because I got a chance to read around 20-25 Suicide Notes of Young, Brilliant, Beautiful and Wonderful Children.

Am I giving so many adjectives to such children because they committed Suicide?

I am sorry. Answer is No… They were in fact, as I said earlier, Young, Brilliant, Beautiful and Wonderful Children.

A Girl with an amazing command of English language in her suicide note (grammatically perfect 5-page Suicide Note with beautiful running handwriting) thanks her mother for giving up her career for raising the children… Subtle hint that she was pricked on this matter again and again.

Another girl wants her grandmother to become her mother in her next birth. Another requests her parents to allow her younger sister to do what she likes and not what they like. One tells candidly that he was manipulated to study science which was not his taste. Many simply write in fewer lines that they could not fulfil the expectations of their parents. Rather few say they were not really capable of doing what is being asked for by them.

All of them thought that Death was a much peaceful and effortless action than going through this dilemma of artificially doing what parents want them to do.

As they say “Tip of the Iceberg” reveals little and hides mountains within, similarly apparent Suicide Cases reflect numbers but reality or the hidden mountain is all those children who did not opt to take this extreme step but certainly are going through stress/worry/anxiety due to pressure on performance.

Many Parents cannot believe after the disaster that it was their own child who took such a drastic measure and I don’t mean to hurt their sentiments any further but the reality is that the child was mentally looking for some blade of grass which a drowning man searches for. That blade of grass could have been your simple appreciation of his efforts… your solacing words of comforts of asking him to do his best and forget the results your absolute unconditioned appreciation of his extraordinariness.

In return, what the child got was threats of performing still better…psychological manipulation by repeat and re-telecasting of the hardships you have gone through for the sake of family. comparison with better performers (neighbors, relatives, children of colleague, ancestors…could be anyone) sharing imagination on the loss/notional gain of social status being dependent on child’ s performance.

We need to understand that statistically speaking not many children commit suicide in comparison to the total number of children coping with such academic pressure if we analyze the numbers but life analysis tells us that their hopes and dreams are overlooked and hurt many a times. So it is high time we pause and contemplate a bit. I need to take a pause here since I hear many of you saying kids do not like many things which are good for them. So the question I tend to hear from you is… Should parents go childrenâ€™s immature ways? Not necessarily.

Well let us try to see what all good things they resisted… Eating right, sleeping right, talking right, behaving right, seeing right, listening right, reading right etc.

Child actually observes parents and never follows anything blindly. Moreover, there is one thing which is certain… Child analyses and looks at the parents to see whether in case any of those things preached are followed by parents to begin with and if so..Whether their parents are really loving, joyful, peaceful and happy by doing so.

They tend to pick up only those habits of their parents that make them happy and peaceful…In case you have seriously messed up situations, your child may even not like you.

It may appear strange and extremely annoying… But there is a possibility of your child not liking you… This comes in many forms and shades. Absolute dislike, not liking few traits of yours, not liking you by comparing you with someone better, not liking you for your over protective care and concern which you may think as love but is suffocating for the child, not liking you for your double standards (we may have…) etc.

So, is it the objective of this letter to make you realise that your child dislikes you?

Answer again is a big No.. Your child does not dislike you… I am just making a point that unconsciously we may have created such a situation, which we need to undo…

Children are parents’ responsibility and we are no one to teach a parent their responsibility nor do we intend to do so… Parents really think good for their children’s future but the point I need to make is that your dreams are always limited to your experience of what is good… what is successful… what is the best thing… Well, the truth is your child may surpass your imagination and reach places which you never even dreamed of…

We all come from different segments of the society in terms of social & economic status, culture, religion, belief systems etc. However as far the natural principle of upbringing a child is concerned they remain the same everywhere.

I am not an expert in Parenting nor have many credentials in “Right Child Care Practices” and I fully understand that different kind of children need different kind of interventions yet I would request you to divert little attention to these fundamental aspects relating to child management.

Creating the right kind of atmosphere for the child to grow and flower in home by making home a really happy, loving and peaceful place to live.
Understanding the needs of the children. There are two extremes in this case…Making the child go through terrible hardships to realise “Your” dreams is one end and the other end is over-pampered care… Both of them definitely do not work.

Take time to switch from teaching mode to learning mode from the child since children show you the way to be really happy and peaceful at times…Instead of learning form them we tend to always assume the role of teacher/preacher.

Allow the child “to be” on his own terms and here I mean especially the child’s engagement with nature and world around and empower them with the right kind of communication skills which are more accommodative. Interaction with the other gender due to their coming of age is not an aberration but a normal process, which you can keep a note on but not try to prevent it totally.

Spend time with children without complaining of your office, life situation, problems, hardships all the timeâ€¦. It may be really too late before you want to spend and there is no more time available with the child. Why? Because we may have made him just like ourselves in an effort to tutor him. We certainly are not the benchmark for the child. Many a times, we may be regressive rudimentary types in comparison to the ability of the child.

Just a final thought. Are we interested in making the child realise “Your Dreams” at any cost or should it be like creating such situations that the child realises “His/Her” Dreams?

I could have simply attended a Parents Counselling Session during admission and spoken on these issues but usually it so happens that in such gatherings we are conditioned and influenced more by impression of the person sitting next to you or people who think different.

Nothing wrong in disagreeing but it is best to disagree on own terms instead of getting influenced by others. Finally, I would like to tender my unconditional apology for taking your time and telling you things about Child Management in which I am no expert and my words in this letter have been gathered by my limited experience in Kota dealing with similar cases and certainly there are great men who have inspired me to put my thoughts before you.

Be the Best Parent in the World!!!!

"[Question] Have you ever been in a situation where after handing cash to a person, they simply forget? What did you do after that? On my way back from college today, a female passenger accused the bus conductor of not returning the amount that belonged to her. She said she handed him a 100 rupee note (for 9 rupee fare) but he only returned her the change for 10.

Immediately, the other passengers chimed in support of the girl (she was wearing some school uniform). But no one really was looking when the actual exchange happened. The other bus conductor vehemently supported his colleague's version of the story. As did the girl for her own.

She was sitting behind me so I also didn't see anything, as I was standing facing the head of a man facing the window (don't ask).

I don't know who is the liar or who simply forgot to pay atttention. In the end the girl did not get her money back.

When you think about it, cash -- being a bearer instrument, is kinda flawed when there are no cameras around. If I think about it, something like this has happened to me also. I paid someone cash but it never registered in their memory. But I got back what was mine. And that's because I was ready to fight to the death for a pittance. Humanity and straight explanation doesn't fly where I live.

In your state, do bus conductors do this thing were they take large note from passenger, and then run to the gate in order to beckon other passengers, and then come back to give the change?

Anyway, I was just wondering. Has something like this happened with you at other places?",AskIndia

Not only that, their was more guidelines which contradicted the previous ones and according to these you simply cannot test a person for COVID-19 if he/she does not have foreign travel history. (these were only changed few days ago)

"My ex-company(a giant MNC) wants me to pay notice period recovery amount even when I didn't propose the last working day. TLDR/I quit my desk job, since I want to pursue adventure sport of paragliding as a living.I resigned, Manager accepted & he proposed a relieving date - all on email.The company wants me to pay notice period shortfall.

I absolutely do NOT want to pay the notice period shortfall.

**How do I go about this?**

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is indeed long, but please read through for details-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The sequence of events in summary:

1. I resigned (official email date 1st January 2019), requested a relieving date from my Manager.
2. My Manager confirmed resignation acceptance & **he proposed the last working day as 28th February 2019**, on email (HR in copy).
3. Per discussion with the Manager, I completed my handover of projects/documentation. I complete last work day formalities & wait for full and final settlement.
4. On March 25th, HR tells me I have to pay a notice period shortfall waiver of 1 month. (citing notice period in contract being 3 months & I have served 2 months )
5. I try to explain, that the date was NOT proposed by me. I followed notice period as advised by the manager & as discussed between me & the manager.
6. They say - Whatever is written in contract takes precedence. Moreover HR cites that the Manager did not explicitly mention in email that the notice period is waived off. I have to pay if I have to clear the dues for the retirals to be processed.
7. Furthermore, HR says this matter is upto discretion of the management ( Management = Centre head of the premises I worked at)
8. My manager is spineless, but I have brought in level-up manager (American) in the communication chain & I would be meeting the centre head in about 9-10 days. (he is out of India right now)

\---

&#x200B;

I have worked for the company for past 6 years. (Out of total 11 years of my total work experience)The company is an Indian division of a giant European MNC.

About a decade ago, the Indian division was mostly a manufacturing facility in Gujarat.

Our centre head is someone who is a veteran from that setup & mostly runs the centre basis same factory-driven-mindset, with loads of hierarchy & ""well set"" grooves and ""network"" of managers.  
That is not how the MNC functions outside India, but the P&L centre shows profit every year, so I guess the counterparts don't interfere.

Since I received the ""Notice period shortfall recovery email"" from HR in March 2019, I have been escalating the issue & seeking a waiver on it, since it was not my suggestion to have a 2 month notice period.

&#x200B;

HR Manager's manager had this overall input ""It is a *small* amount.. You should part ways on good note..""

The HR manager's manager borderline threatened me for the escalation with

""Do you want us to tell **this** when we get a call for background check anytime in the future?""

&#x200B;

He also mentioned, that this is the process they follow & ultimate discretion lies with management now.

So, I figured, it is pointless talking to him.*I did some digging and there was this IT/Systems in charge fellow who resigned recently. He served the notice period & for whatever reason, his manager let him go 2 days earlier, that too with a record on email.Still, he was asked to pay 2 days worth of notice period recovery amount, before his dues were cleared!!He paid it up since he was supposed to leave abroad for his next job & it was a small amount which he didn't want to hold up the larger settlement dues over that.*

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It simply blows my mind, that a company like such is actually hell bent on making money off notice period shortfalls, especially where the parting is mutual & hasn't even caused any business harm/loss or lack of transfer of work.

I absolutely do **NOT** want to pay the notice period shortfall.**How do I go about this?**

I was thinking about:

1. Writing to the ombudsperson (reporting helpline for intercompany disputes) - to get some global heat in this.
2. Writing about this to as many functional head & Global HR email addresses I can gather to just get this escalated so much, that it cannot be just pressed down.
3. Getting lawyer's opinion on this. (I would really like to avoid any legal proceeding, since that would call for a lot of work, time, money!)

**Going Gaga Over GST**

Last week, the Rajya Sabha [passed](http://indianexpress.com/article/business/business-others/gst-bill-pass-what-next-step-by-step-until-the-rollout-2952723/) the Goods and Services Tax (GST) - the tax reform that has been heralded as the most important piece of legislation in over a decade. While the common market of Europe is walking backwards due to Brexit, the common market within India is stepping ahead due to GST. The bill has been the subject of political bickering for a long time now. However, it was passed with 203 votes for and none against. With 0 votes against. They didn’t even blink twice, so you know there families weren’t being held hostage and all votes were entirely voluntary. But this has only been the tip of the iceberg. Even though both houses of the parliament have passed the bill, there is a laundry list of things that need to happen before we can all go home and forget about this whole GST business. The Lok Sabha needs to approve the bill once again. Then, a minimum of 15 state governments need to pass the bill. Then, the president needs to sign the bill. Then, a GST Council needs to be formed and the GST tax rate needs to be negotiated. Then, the central government needs to pass two supporting laws, and each state needs to pass a separate supporting law. And only then, we’ll be able to pocket all that cash from the GST-led economic growth that is being predicted. The deadline set for all of this is April 1st, 2017. Till then, government officials around the country are set to debate on extremely sensitive issues like whether cream biscuits should be taxed at the same rate as ordinary biscuits. #TeamBourbon.

**Uber-Didi**

Uber joined the long list of American MNCs that came to do business in China but inevitably fell on their faces. In a deal announced last week, the popular ride-hailing service will sell its China operations to rival Didi Chuxing in [exchange](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/02/business/dealbook/china-uber-didi-chuxing.html?_r=0) for a 20% stake in Didi, who will invest $1 billion in Uber. The two giants have been battling for the Chinese market for years and despite spending billions of dollars, no one has managed to turn a profit. In fact, Uber was facing a loss of $1 billion annually due to heavy competition in China. Once upon a time, Uber’s future in China seemed to hold promise. And now, the company is throwing in the towel. The company’s mistake? It tried to fight a land war in Asia. Although Didi was the bigger company in China in terms of market share, Uber did have its moments. Such as when a Chinese hip-hop artist posted a gangster rap song about how much he prefers Uber. Don’t Baidu it - China being China censored the whole thing just days later.

**Loans For *Pani Puri wala*s**

Banks use all sorts of fancy algorithms to determine if a borrower will repay a loan. Despite all of that, with the banking crisis, a huge amount of loans are at a risk of being Vijay Mallya-ed. So the fancy algorithms haven’t exactly worked out. Another one of those fancy things that banks use is a credit score. A good credit score will have banks lining outside your door shouting for your attention. A bad credit score will have you lining outside the door of the banks with a ton of paperwork. You need a good credit score to get loans. But to get a good credit score, you need to repay loans. So you see the chicken-and-egg problem here. This means a lot of people don’t even have credit scores. But those people still need loans. And banks won’t touch them with a ten-foot pole. Now, microfinance companies like Edelweiss, Bharat Financial, DHFL and many more are going places feared by the big boys of finance. A big push in the industry is to loan [money](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/saturated-cities-now-even-idli-vada-seller-can-get-loan/articleshow/53515598.cms) to pavement hawkers, scrap dealers and other self-employed individuals. For example - the makers of the extremely healthy chinese food at the hand-kart that parks near the local sewer every evening. Basically, giving loans to low-income borrowers without a credit score or any kind of formal financial history. If that sounds like a recipe for trouble, that’s because it is and we’ve already had that dish in the run-up of the financial crisis of 2008. And if history isn’t repeating itself here, it’s definitely rhyming.


**Too Many Branches Spoil The Bank**

The State Bank Of India has almost 17,000 branches which is very impressive. Especially since they get to brag about it in tables that rank banks by number of branches. But the bank isn’t doing itself any favours by putting 5 branches within a 1 km radius of each other, as is the case a lot of times with SBI. Because sometimes, it’s not the size that matters, it’s what you do with it that matters. And SBI is [considering](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/sbi-weighs-plan-to-shut-relocate-30-of-its-branches/articleshow/53494912.cms) a proposal to do away with such extra branches by consolidating them. It might make common sense to shut down branches when put like that, but then they won’t get to brag about how many branches they have. And investors love those kind of things. SBI is currently in the process of merging with its associate banks from Hyderabad, Mysore, Travancore and so on. It expects to have that completed by March 2017. At which point, that 17,000 number will balloon up to 24,000 branches, compounding that problem. A global consulting firm, McKinsey which was hired by SBI has recommended shutting down upto of 7,200 of those branches. Moreover, bank branches are so *2000s*. Online is where it’s at.

Moon Express, a US-based company co-founded by Indian-origin entrepreneur Naveen Jain, [became](https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/03/moon-express-becomes-first-private-company-to-receive-permission-to-go-to-the-moon/) the first ever private company to receive permission from the US government for a commercial space mission to the moon. The company’s business plan involves accepting sponsorships and carrying private payloads to the moon in order to make a profit. In future space missions, the company expects to make money by mining for natural resources on moon, specifically mining for Helium-3. This would’ve happened a lot sooner if only the moon had some oil. Helium-3 is all fine... But it’s no oil.

"Need college/career advice I am a Delhi resident studying in Delhi Technological University and just completed my 1st year. My branch is environmental engineering, I chose it by mistake and honestly have no interest in it neither it is a good career to persue in India because of less jobs and low salary. I have interest in Computer Science and wish to persue it as my career. So I have 2 options  at the moment. Study CS on my own and try to land an off campus job which is very dificult I've heard from seniors, or I could take admission in DU in BSc computer science this year in colleges like SSCBS or Hansraj. My 12th percentage was 94.75% and I have already cleared the sscbs cutoff, and might also clear the Hansraj cutoff in upcoming lists.
My aim is land a well paying  job after college. DTU has a lot of non tech placements in analyst/consulting roles which are open for all branches and most non Cs students opt for that. I don't know much about that field and if it is right for me or not.
If I go for DU colleges, they don't have good placements after Bsc and one would have to go for masters like MBA/Ms in India or abroad.
What should I do? Continue in DTU or join Hansraj or SSCBS?
Please Help.",Science/Technology
"Will I get a full refund on my Jet Airways International Flight scheduled next moent? Hi, I have a question for people well versed with flight cancellation rules. I have an international round trip flight booked with Jet on May 13. The cancellation charge per ticket is 10,500 INR. 

With all the commotion going on and Jet cancelling international flights, **is there any way I can get all my money on those tickets back** (without the losing 10,500 per ticket)?

As per the ticket fine print, I am eligible for a full refund if they reschedule or cancel. But they haven't mailed me personally about the reschedule, I have sent them a mail asking for my money.

"First the ticket window is shut and then you see the indicators struggling for their last breath. Are the indicators or is the system broken? Here's my story, what's yours? Ticket windows at most small stations in Mumbai are shut post 09:30 PM. I have faced this at multiple stations like Matunga, Vidyavihar, Marine Lines.

&amp;#x200B;

I asked the station master at Marine Lines that where can I get the ticket and he pointed me to other end of the station for which you have to go through the platform or cross a very shady road risking your life at night (same with other stations).

Upon raising the safety concern, he, along with another staff member, tried to attack me physically. I was lucky that a train just halted at station and I ran to board it risking my life further.

&amp;#x200B;

I tweeted to IRCTC and all they did was tag one account after another and nothing ever happened.

&amp;#x200B;

Do not ask me to use AVTM or UTS to book the ticket online. What about those who do not use tech as easily as we all do? Are they allowed to travel ticketless?

&amp;#x200B;

The recent Badlapur incident where a train was stuck in floods and passengers had to be airlifted. IS the system so incompetent that they cannot see the rising water to stop the train before situation goes out of control? It was not a flash flood which caused the issue. It had be raining since a week.

&amp;#x200B;

I might be completely wrong here and missing some critical thought process behind shutting shops and not planning the train signals. So any argument is welcomed but the way Indian Railways is evolving is making me wonder what is our future.

"PSA: When ordering relatively obscure books on Amazon.in, don't fully trust seller ratings. It may not arrive in brand new condition. I ordered a lot of books (manga and full scifi/fantasy novels) (about Rs. 20k order value) from Amazon recently. I have only received the first part of the order today.

I received Gene Mapper (Fujii Taiyo) and RG Veda Omnibus vols 1, 2 &amp; 3 (CLAMP) today. The books arrived in a less than stellar condition, to the extent that they might even be second hand or poorly stored! My copies of Cardcaptor Sakura's omnibus editions which I bought circa 2013 are in much better shape!

All of them have completely worn out covers, with smudge, grime and scuff marks all over. Bits of the cover print have also worn off. The page edges also appear to have ageing stains. The thick books were packed in a shoddy manner so the corners are bent.

Amazon customer service can only offer full returns, and won't give partial refunds. That leaves me with a major problem. I don't know where else to get these books at a competitive price. Sapnaonline is more expensive by Rs. 1000 for volume 2, and Flipkart is Rs. 600 more expensive for each volume.

The Amazon sellers were uRead and Amazing-Buy. I suspect they're actually the same seller since their prices are always identical, both have practically the same inventory in stock, and their parts of the order were processed together.",Non-Political

"Hi r/india, I made a bot to stop fake news on WhatsApp [edit 3: looks like it's been blocked by Facebook. Fuck. I will try to speak to them about this]

As we all know, WhatsApp is a major source of disinformation in our country. To help mitigate this, I've created a bot that crowdsources information on fake WhatsApp forwards. It works with text, photos, videos, audio clips, etc.

Wanna try it out? **Send any fake forwards that you have received to +14704378045** (over WhatsApp). Please encourage any gullible friends you might have to try it too.

It's a little bit volatile at the moment (blame Facebook for making automation difficult) and goes down from time to time. Please be patient if this happens, it is scheduled to restart at 5:30 am IST everyday.

Comments and suggestions welcome.

Edit 2:
Many people are asking how the bot stops fake news, so I'm copy pasting my explanation here -

There are two main scenarios:

1. You receive a WhatsApp forward which you know is factually fake and want to report it. You can forward the message to this bot and report it as fake, and leave a note as to why you think it's fake.

2. You receive a WhatsApp forward and want to check if it's genuine before believing it/passing it on. You can forward it to the bot, and the bot will inform you how many people have reported it as fake and their reasons for doing so

"Key Points From the Draft New Education Policy (2019) Link : https://mhrd.gov.in/sites/upload_files/mhrd/files/Draft_NEP_2019_EN_Revised.pdf

The document itself has 3 parts:

1. School Education

2. College/University Education

3. Additional Key Focus Areas

In the interest of keeping the discussions focussed and understandable, I have split it into 3 posts.
This is part 1.

Part 2 is now up: https://old.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bx1lr7/key_points_from_the_new_education_policy_2019/

---
##Summary

This policy is easily the biggest change to the education system since the old policy came in. It is in many ways, entirely unrecognisable, while in many other ways, simply formalising what was informally already done.

The first and biggest change, is that primary education, from ages 3-6, is now a formal part of school education, and public school must offer this. The second change, what goes hand in hand, is the abolishing of the 10+2 system. In many ways, the 10+2 system completely ignored the way a student's mind developed, and thus made for a poor learning system. The new system is 5+3+3+4. These stages are as follows:

- 5 years of the Foundational Stage: 3 years of pre-primary school and Grades 1, 2.

- 3 years of the Preparatory (or Latter Primary) Stage: Grades 3, 4, 5.

- 3 years of the Middle (or Upper Primary) Stage: Grades 6, 7, 8.

- 4 years of the High (or Secondary) Stage: Grades 9, 10, 11, 12.

The new Foundational stage, is supposedly meant to be ""age fluid"". Your age does not matter, as long as you are within the age group 3-8. The Policy recommends that during the foundation stage there should be no textbook based education, and instead play based and activity based education. It also emphasises on introducing a variety of new ""stimuli"" to force children's brains to develop in a holistic manner. These stimuli include : music (classical or modern, both singing and listening), art (regional, national, sketching, etc.), literature (folk tales, literature from the region, and national quality authors, both modern and classical). This is a massive departure from the present system, and the new emphasis on arts, is excellent. To add to this, a new bilingual policy is introduced. Students who learn languages are shown to have much better cognitive abilities than those don't so the new system makes all students learn 2 languages right from the start. One of these has to be the mother tongue, in order to preserve it. The other language may vary by region and requirements. The three language policy remains, and will be better enforced. The final changes to the primary education, is the integration of ""anganwadis"" into schools, and shifting them from primarily health workers, to full scale trained teachers, satisfying the needs of the students. The NEP requires the full development of people-skills, through a variety of things like weekly assemblies and daily show-and-tells. This improves the speaking ability, something that IMO Indian students have historically been terrible at. New extras include group reading of stories, learning morality and ethics (along with a proper framework), puzzle solving of various types, etc. to make sure a child has a significantly better development. Students who fall behind are not left out, instead the teachers are required to identify and help them, as studies suggest that students who fall back early almost never recover.

The next ""Preparatory stage"" lays emphasis on shifting from a more informal style in the Foundation stage, to a more formal textbook oriented education, in the Middle stage. It is a bridge stage. Please not that the policy emphasises that any and all technical education *must* take place in the native language (mother tongue) first. This is because students who learn in their mother tongue have a noticeable advantage over those who learn in say English. The policy also has a very good write-up on why the emphasis on English has hurt India a lot. The preparatory stage also keeps this focus on arts, and expects students to fully develop other skills beyond the ""textbook education"". The policy also demands the abolishing of the so called ""co-curricular activities"" instead integrating them into the core curriculum. This makes things like PE, yoga, art, music, a core part of the education. It also requires that every student specialise in at least one of these subjects. Another new concept here is the selection of the best students to help the worst students. The best students are selected by the teacher, and then become part of a sort of ""national training system"".

The third stage is the ""Middle Stage"". By this time, the student's mind would have developed enough. It is now time to start the fully formal education. Subjects start splitting from generic versions into more detailed subjects (like science -&gt; physics + chemistry + biology). Students at this point will slowly start to also learn technical subjects in English. The idea is that students will be able to think in their mother tongue (which has a lot of advantages), while being able to understand and present ideas in English.

The fourth, and final stage is the ""High Stage"". At this point, students have developed a lot. Their mind now starts thinking in ""the bigger picture"" mode, and they can start planning for the rest of their life. In order to support this, students are now allowed to freely select courses and specialise. They are still required to understand and complete art courses, as this is paramount to their abilities, regardless of the final courses they choose.

Some important courses that come over the 12 years include : course on ethics and morality, Indian languages and their history and regional literature.

The next major changes come to the school management system. Schools can now form ""complexes"". A complex is comprised of nearby schools, such that each complex as a whole offers all of the above stages. Complexes are then given funds and other resources, like teachers. These resources may then be split up among the schools as necessary. This is important, because some types of teachers are relatively rare, and thus it provides optimal utilisation of resources. Sometimes other resources like libraries may also be shared. The exact details of what is shared will vary depending of the schools and their locality (population density, and ""backwardness"" of the population).

Schools also get a new level of autonomy, that was previously missing. Teachers are allowed to be the final deciders on the courses, and how they will be taught.

In order to improve attendance, the schools will do a number of things. Depending on the area, buses may be provided. Roads will be redone, so that transport is easier. Older students will be provided with free bicycles. The mid day meals will also be extended to offer basic breakfast to students. Adequate and safe infrastructure, including working toilets, clean drinking water, clean and attractive spaces conducive to learning, electricity, computing devices, and internet, will be important to provide to all schools.

To reduce inequality is a primary goal of the new policy. In order to do this, each school complex will have committee overseeing the demographics, and why students aren't attending. Specific groups called out include Muslims (for unwillingness to attend), and women in general. The policy requires that people of all castes and religions be integrated into the schools. The teachers are also required to emphasise on equality, by preventing acts that discriminate (e.g. not allowing SC/STs to sit with ""upper caste students"", etc.). The schools are required to join with the community in eradicating inequality. They are required to talk with parents and try and change their behaviour. This could be the groundwork to eliminating the reservation system. The policy sets the target of 2030, by which the majority of the students will be ""equalised"", not by pulling down the richer and higher caste, but by pulling up the poorer and downtrodden. Special Education Zones will be set up in disadvantaged regions across the country. The Central government will support extra investment and per-child expenditure in the ratio of 2:1 for each rupee spent by the State in these Zones. A special National Fund will be created specifically for providing scholarships and developing resources and facilities for students from Under Represented Groups.

The next set of changes are aimed at teachers. The primary aims are to improve teacher pay, and status in society. It recognises that teachers are already heavily burdened with a lot of work, so no government work may be offloaded onto teachers. They are also educated better, and stricter standards are set. Teachers are required to ""re-educate"" themselves by joining workshops, and the vertical mobility of teacher is to be improved. Teacher education will gradually be moved into multidisciplinary colleges and universities. By 2030, the minimum degree qualification for teaching will be a four-year liberal integrated B.Ed. degree that teaches a range of knowledge content and pedagogy.
Developmental opportunities, in the form of local, State, national, and international teaching and subject workshops, as well as online teacher development modules, will be available to all teachers. Substandard stand-alone Teacher Education Institutions (TEIs) across the country will be shut down as soon as possible. New teachers will have to register with an authority, and then will be quickly shifted into a school complex, for integration with the schools as necessary.

The next major changes comes to the testing system. The new system will be run by the National Testing Agency (which was newly set up in 2017 for entrance exams). They will be conducting the tests, and the new tests will be more like aptitude tests.  They will de-emphasise rote learning, instead encouraging an understanding of the subject. The policy claims that by 2020, all schools will have internet connected computers. It thus pushes for some degree of digitisation, by allowing for continuous evaluation through computers. Board exams in 10th and 12th are no longer. Instead we have exams in 3rd, 5th and 8th, called Census exams. The idea is to reduce the importance of Board exams. Teachers will also be more involved in the governance of schools and school complexes.

This policy also paves the way for better recognition of ""top talent"" students. For e.g. if a student is really good in Math, then they will be attending special summer schools to improve their performance. As already mentioned, top students are also required to tutor the students who are have a hard time coping. There is also a new emphasis on Olympiads. This should improve India's ranks in international competitions.

The RTE act sees some changes. It is now extended to the full duration of school, from ages 3-18. The RTE act itself will have to be reviewed, as the policy notes.

As for private institutions, there has been some misinformation. Private institutions will have to undergo some changes to have a similar system, so that they too can reach out to all students. The main changes are how fees is regulated. Fees needs to be rationalised, and can't be arbitrarily high. Once set, fee increments must go inline with inflation and reasonable increases, as opposed to random increases. Schools are also now required by law to be non-profit, and must be verified regularly by submitting all of their financial details. Private schools are also prohibited from having the word ""public"" in their name. So be prepared to see a lot of name changes.

Schools will now also be accredited and regulated in a slightly more free manner. However, they are required to release all details to the public. A framework and guidelines for ensuring school safety and security of children will be developed, and will be made a part of the eligibility conditions for a school education institution for recognition and registration. Every principal and teacher will be made aware of the provisions of the relevant Acts, Rules, Regulations, etc. relating to child rights, and what constitutes their violation, by including a module in the teachers’/principals’ education/training programmes and refresher courses. Self-learning online programmes on child rights will be developed for the benefit of students, teachers, and parents. Credible mechanisms for students to report breaches of their rights, and for appropriate actions to be taken against perpetrators, will be developed and implemented, in collaboration with local police. The Adolescent Education Programme and National Population Education Programme will be integrated into the curriculum of schools in a phased manner. (please note that Adolescent Education Programme is not sex education).

Also, in addition to all this, alternative forms of schools like gurukulas, patashalas, and madrassas will be encouraged, as long as they follow a modernised syllabus and are fully transparent.

The first changes will be implemented by 2020, with most major changes being in place by 2022. The first benefits will be seen by 2025, and by 2030, we should have fully transitioned, with all benefits in place.

##Comparison With the Current System:

The existing system failed primarily in 2 ways: Languages were poorly integrated, and many schools did not even offer three languages, as the policy notes. Hindi speaking states and TN were the primary offenders. Now all students are required to learn languages as per the Three Language Formula. The other way the old system failed was in testing. NCF (2005) laid heavy focus on eliminating rote learning, and in introducing a system where discovery based education was encouraged. The 10th grade NCERT textbook for science is a testament to that. Yet the system failed, because tests only cared about how well a student could mug up and vomit arbitrary facts. The new policy does try to fix this, but how much will improve remains to be seen.

The other more minor ways in which it failed was the integration of ""extra curricular"" subjects. Many schools actually refused to teach these subjects, considering them a time waste. The new system makes them a core part of the education system, so there should be an improvement.

Please discuss, and if you have any doubts, feel free to ask.

##TL;DR:

1. Learning to learn

2. Mother tongue as primary language of learning

3. Focus on trilingual policy, with English no longer as primary language

4. Equality of all students

5. Arts, Sports, Music, literature, etc. are all now of primary importance, and each student has to specialise in one of these, in addition to courses of their choice

6. Digital Education

7. Freedom of choice in higher stage of education

8. Board exams removed in favour of more frequent ""census exams""

9. Testing now to focus on aptitude and understanding, with more frequent tests, a la CCE under CBSE

10. 10+2 eliminated in favour of 5+3+3+4, with full focus on primary (3-8 years) of education",Policy/Economy

Important controversial Judgement: Justice Goel’s judgment on prevention of misuse of SC/ST Act in Dr. Shubhash Kashinath Mahajan vs. The State of Maharashtra, is one of the much talked about decision. Justice Goel along with Justice Lalit examined the question on the inclusion of procedural safeguards so that the provisions of Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) (SC/ST) Act 1989 are not abused for extraneous considerations. The Bench held that, a Government official cannot be prosecuted on mere allegation of committing an offence under the Act without the sanction of appointing authority. [1](https://www.indialegallive.com/constitutional-law-news/courts-news/justice-ak-goel-retires-from-sc-defends-his-judgment-in-sc-st-act-51270) [2](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/justice-ak-goel-who-ruled-on-dalit-atrocities-law-retires-from-top-court-1879280)

***So what about him?***

Let's go back to Vajpayee's government when Arun Jaitley was Minister of Law and Justice.

From Article: [Govt ignored IB report on HC judge](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Govt-ignored-IB-report-on-HC-judge/articleshow/45701970.cms).

>*High court judges are appointed in the following way: The state government sends a list of names through the governor to the chief justices of the Supreme Court and the concerned high court. This list is then sent to the law ministry, which obtains an IB report on the nominees. Thereafter, it prepares a matrix with three criteria â€” professional competence, integrity and political links.*  
>  
>*In the case of Goel, the law ministry matrix contains no entry under the ''Professional Competence'' column, while the ''Reputation/Integrity'' column bluntly says: ""Corrupt person"".*  
>  
>*The key to his subsequent appointment appears to be the listing in the political affiliation column, which notes that Goel was general secretary of the All-India Adhiwakta Parishad, the lawyers'' wing of the RSS. Curiously, among the five short-listed advocates whose integrity the IB had questioned, he was the only one cleared by the ministry.*  
>  
>*Having sent back the file once, Narayanan had the constitutional obligation of approving the appointment but he made his unhappiness clear. The President noted: ""Nonetheless, I feel that a more desirable course of action would have been to follow the same procedure as was done in a similarly placed case of the Calcutta High Court where the advice of the Chief Justice, which is integral to the selection process, was sought again and duly received...I would also appreciate if my instant observations are shared with the Chief Justice of India along with my earlier observation dated May 3, 2001 on this matter.""*

***He then became the Chief Justice of the Odisha High Court and the Gauhati High Court before becoming the Supreme Court Judge.***

### Goel was elevated to the Supreme Court alongside Arun Mishra.

The Caravan Magazine says and I quote

>*the collegium had thrice considered and decided against Mishra’s nomination; on one of these occasions, it had asked for a background check on him. According to an article in the Economic and Political Weekly, the check revealed that Mishra was close to the RSS. Any prior reservations were evidently put aside with the advent of the Modi government.*

\[But I couldn't search in *Economic and Political Weekly, If anyone finds the article, please do comment \].*

AK Mishra has been known for his BJP favouring judgements. [1](https://theprint.in/report/friend-of-cji-misra-target-supreme-court-judges-ire/28323/) [2](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/contempt-threat-to-lawyer-justice-arun-mishra-apologises/articleshow/72380063.cms) [3](https://frontline.thehindu.com/the-nation/article29897723.ece)

"Those who come from conventional middle class families and are in open marriages, how do you overcome your conflicts? Many of us have grown up with families where our parents' relationships were fairly simple and love was chopping vegetables for your wife after coming home from work or making tea for him when he looks blue. Anything hanky panky like open marriage, polyamory, dont ask dont tell, hall pass etc. was unthinkable. 

Cut to today, we are surrounded by people who do practice such marriages (sometimes openly) and some people are into successful open marriages. 

Those, who come from conventional families where the love between parents was strictly monogamous, here are some things I was wondering

1. Do you compare their relationship with yours? 
2. Does your partner come from a similar family background? 
3. If you follow a ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy, do you sometimes wonder who they may be with or get insecure? 
4. If your partner is getting more action than you, do you reconsider the polyamory?
5. Do you, even for a fraction of a second, wish you had what your parents have in their relationship?",AskIndia

"A stand against pro-CAA bigotry - A heated debate Below is an argument I had with a pro-CAA bigot presented to you in a quote-unquote form. Please note that this was in text, and all quotes here are literal, 'as-is' of what I received from them without any tampering. The unquoted ones are mine.

&#x200B;

>Cleansing your mind from rumours and understand the correct interpretation of the CAA----  
>  
>It's very distressing that people conclude the wrong interpretation of the **Citizenship Act** **2019** **(CAA)** , first understand the ground related with this Act.  
>  
>**Nehru--Liaquat Pact 1950,** that  mentioned both the countries give assurance that the religious  minorities of their respective countries will be taken care of and their  rights will be protected on the premises of **“Critical Hostage Theory”**  that means religious minorities in both the countries shall act as  hostages for the short of ensurance that their religious minorities  would be protected but now the condition has been changed because of  loosing the credibility of this Act and there is religious persecution  of the minorities in Pakistan and Bangladesh (earlier east Pakistan) and  also in Afghanistan in the same line on the basis of their Islamic  constitution.  
>  
>And  for that, the purpose of CAA came into existence to protect these  minorities from the religious persecution in the hands of majority of  these three countries while giving them Indian citizenship but it  doesn't mean that it bar the entry of any muslim from other countries of  the world, they can seek Indian citizenship under the Citizenship Act  of 1955 and it is wrongly stupid argument that it will stripping the  citizenship of Indian Muslims. It also doesn't mean that it would give  citizenship of India to these persecuted minorities very smoothly, No  never they can attain Indian citizenship only on the basis of the proper  process of naturalisation, if they will failed in this process then  they can't attain the Indian citizenship.  
>  
>Don't interpreted the CAA with **NRC**  because the CAA has nothing to do with NRC, the legal provisions of the  NRC have been part of the Citizenship Act, 1955 since December 2004.  Also there are specific statutory rules of 2003 to operationalise these  legal provisions. They govern the process of registration of Indian  citizens and issuance of national identity cards to them. These legal  provisions have been on the statute book since last 15–16 years. The CAA  has not altered them in any way whatsoever. Don't interpreted it like  that illegal Hindus outside and inside India will be protected via the  CAA and muslims will be discriminated, no not at all, both illegal  Hindus and Muslims claim for Indian citizenship equally via the process  of naturalisation, where CAA will not given blanket protect to Hindus.  
>  
>Don't  interpreted the CAA in the context of Ahmadiyas in Pakistan, hazaras in  Afghanistan and illegal rohingyas in India because Ahmadiyas in  Pakistan are in majority and they believe in the Pakistani version of  Islam and not maintain the level of minority same as hazaras in  Afghanistan stand in the internal context of their governance and  rohingyas are hostile community at international level and they are the  native of the neighbouring countries and they are illegally stable in  India without the citizenship of India and they will be identified under  the NRC for the purpose of deporting at their place.

&#x200B;

The  pretext of your answer assumes that since the countries mentioned in  the CAA (Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh) have failed to protect  their minorities, and henceforth, failed to keep-up with the  Nehru-Liaquat pact, and since these people might share ancestry  with/were born in pre-1947 India, it’s the responsibility of the Indian  State to protect them.

However, Afghanistan wasn’t a part of the partition, and nor of the Nehru-Liaquat Pact. Why have them under the same belt then?

In  that case, if we’re opening our doors to religiously-persecuted  minorities from other countries (which is a good thing), why not include  Muslims and other non-Hindu minorities from Nepal (which was a Hindu  Rashtra until as late as 2008), and non-Sinhalese people from Sri Lanka?

You  also seem to contradict your statement when it comes to Rohingyas (who  according to Amnesty International, are the most persecuted minority in  the World), Hazaras or Ahmadiya Muslims (you exclude Ugyur Muslims too)  citing that they are Muslims (and thus, constitute majority in their  respective country). Please note that Ahmadiyas aren’t even considered  Muslims in Pakistan, and CAA can, very flexibly, be extended to support them.

Why is it a factor for us that they belong to the majority?

Let me tell you - because, as of current version of CAA, it does NOT mention *“religious persecution”*  at all. It just says that if you belong to <INSERT ALLOWED  RELIGIONS>, and were in India in b/w <INSERT DATES>, you shall  be offered Indian citizenship.

Now, if they’d include Muslims too, entire citizenry of Pakistan would have a free pass to Indian citizenship.

I’m  all in for greater humanitarian interests of supporting refugees, but  all of this evidence points out that this step from government is a  petty tactic for winning the Bengal elections (by the support from  Bangladeshi Hindus and other immigrants).

&#x200B;

>**Irrelevant Argument related with the Violation of the Articles of the Constitution of India——**  
>  
>There  is argument of the constitutional obligation on CAA then understand it  broadly, there is no any provision of CAA has been violated any articles  of the Constitution of India include Article 14 as well. Understand  it---  
>  
>**Article 14** (**Come** **under** **Part-3** **of** **the** **Indian** **Constitution**) doesn't  deal with the part of citizenship that obliging towards the status of  citizenship, the purpose of Article 14 check implied where equals are  treated differently without any reasonable basis. But where equals and  unequal are treated differently, the Article 14 does not mean that all  laws must be general in character. It does not mean that the same laws  should **apply**  to all persons. It does not mean that every law must have universal  application for, all person are not, by nature, attainment or  circumstances in the same position.  
>  
>**Article** **5 to 11** **(under** **PART-2)**  are the only articles of the Constitution of India that deal with the  context of Citizenship, where Article 11 state that it grant of  citizenship shall be subject to any further law that the parliament may  passed in this particular regards, its the only union parliament which  have the power in this particular issue, it is not within the domain of  states. In the context of Citizenship Article 5 to 11 of the  Constitution of India shall read along with the Citizenship Act of 1955  coupled with the foreigners Act of 1946 that deal with the who is the  foreigner of as far as India's concern.

It’s not that this bill is ‘*literally*’  targeting the constitution of India, but it’s hurting it’s principles  of equality in the sense that the Indian Government is judging people  (and I quote you) by *“level of minority”*,  and that too, falsely. Religious discrimination faced against the Tamil  people in Sri Lanka, or the pain of Ugyurs in China is no-less than the  plight of Hindu people in Pakistan.

Also,  you comment that we shouldn’t tie up CAA with NRC. However, there are  two main reasons that I can cite in favor of studying CAA in light of  NRC:

* Firstly, the Home Minister, at least in 7 of his recent speeches, has always spoken of them together.
* Secondly,  and more importantly, because, assuming the NRC pan India will be  similar to assam, it will give extreme discretionary powers to local  authorities, who have the power to claim ANYONE (not Muslims, not  Hindus, not Christians, yes anyone) as ""doubtful citizens"". The basis of  such a conclusion is vague, and hence extremely exploitative. It’s like  giving them \[the Registrar\] a free pass to exploit the poor, or  anyone/any community they hold grudges against. Don’t we already have  enough of it?  
Not to forget, it can be used as a tool to suppress  dissent - If you dare say anything against the government, they’d have  the authority to strip you off of your citizenship. This pain might be  less for non-Muslims because if they are rich, they can hope to claim  citizenship under the CAA (*cough* bribe *cough*).

The  sea of reasons mentioned here are enough for people to oppose a bill.  The NRC is tangential to this discussion, but forms a very important  base of the ongoing protests.

Also,  these protests aren’t just against CAA, or the NRC, or NPR for that  matter. It’s also against the brutality with which the police took  action against the protestors. Among all other things, it is also to  assert our right to dissent, and to assert the fact that people’s  opinion has a rightful place in a democracy, which given the current  government’s stance, they are crumbling. (Just today \[Jan. 3. '20\], Home  Minister said that they wouldn’t move an inch backwards on CAA.)

Enhance your  knowledge and maintain the status of democracy of this nation.  
   
>  
>“CAA is not in the context of stripping the Citizenship of any Indian Citizen and their fundamental rights”  
 

You also wrongly quote the Arabic Kalma - *“La Ilaha Illallah”* sprayed on the wall in Jamia. It literally means *“Ekam brahmasmi, dutiya nasti”*,  which if you’d be Hindu enough to read Brahma Sutra you’d know means,  “There’s just one God. None other.” People might call it 'Brahma',  'Ishwara', 'Bhagwan', 'Allah', 'God', a tree, or whatever - but it’s ultimately one (An idea which is  popular even in a religion such as Hinduism which is known for it’s many  gods – Many Hindu school of thoughts subscribe to worshiping idols, but  the belief across Sanatana Dharma (even in the Nastika philosophy) is  to believe in the absolute - *'Brahmand'*).

Also,  you talk about violence in the protests. I cannot speak for everywhere,  but from the news reports, it seems that most (and the largest)  gatherings against CAA-NRC-NPR are peaceful. Even if there was violence,  the brutality with which the police is reacting doesn’t justify any of  it. (Raping minors, killing people!!).

There  have been reports of how people have been planted in the mob to  instigate violence - you know who this would benefit - definitely, not  the protestors.

In the end, I’d like to quote you:

"Change my view India: Civil Service is not a good career option as far as freedom and power are concerned. Civil Service is not a good career option as far as freedom and power to make changes are concerned. In this post, by civil servants I mostly mean the glamorous posts like collectors and IPS officers. But it is applicable to other posts too.

Some people say civil servants like collectors and IPS officers can make a great deal of changes. But they're ability to make changes is limited to only very few areas. If a person like a collector or an IPS is to move against a minister or a politician or a wealthy businessman, then it is most probably sure that he/she will have a tough time. Probably he/she will be suspended or transferred.

As India is a democracy the elected representatives have more power over the executionaries of which civil servants are a part. Besides politicians have the support of the masses in many cases and they bend the laws using their power.

Waste management, traffic etc are some of the areas in which civil servants can make changes. These are areas in which ministers and politicians do not interfere much.

Many collectors and IPS officers are puppets under politicians. Even if a politician gets behind the bars, he/she would be getting preferential treatment in there.

Civil service is glamorous only because of the salary and benefits and respect one gets from being in that position. I don't understand why people are going after it still if they want to have real freedom and power. Just getting money won't give us enough freedom. Of course. There are those civil servants who are highly corrupted. But then even they are just puppets under the politicians.

"Delhi Government today raised the minimum wage to highest for any state in the country, after SC ruled in their favour. Almost 3 times as much as UP. Will immediately benefit 55 lakh workers. Delhi government had tried to raise the minimum wage in 2017 but this had been taken to court by a number of associations of employers. High Court ordered against the hike in 2018, which was then appealed to Supreme Court. 

Delhi government then constituted a Minimum Wage Advisory Committee in November 2018 that finalised the wages. This amounts to Rs14,842/month for unskilled workers, which was submitted before the Supreme Court. The SC has now accepted Delhi Government's proposal. 

Comparison with some other states:

> Delhi ₹14842

> Haryana ₹8827

> UP ₹5750

> Gujarat ₹8190

> Maharashtra ₹10411

> [National Minimum Wage](https://thewire.in/labour/delhi-minimum-wake-hike) ₹ 4,576 (recommended, but not implemented ₹9,750) 

Of course Delhi has a higher cost of living, but I can't imagine other cities like Lucknow being 3 times cheaper. Therefore other state governments also need to look at their wages and revise them. 


> A Bench of Justices U.U. Lalit and Aniruddha Bose, in an order passed on October 14, permitted the Delhi government to bring into effect its draft proposal to revise minimum wages of unskilled labourers to ₹14,842, ₹16,341 for semi-skilled, ₹17,991 for skilled workers, ₹16,341 for non-matriculates, ₹17,991 for matriculates who are not graduates and ₹19,572 for graduates and above.

"What are the realistic options/pathways to defeat Modi in 2024? I have worked with the BJP they have a working plan till 2029 and going quite as planned! With the way things are going, I have little doubt that the country is being irreparably polarised and Modi is going to come back riding another wave in 2024 elections! But to stop that we need a realistic plan.  I know multiple top RSS functionaries because of my previous job and in my exchanges, with them it's clear they are not going to back down on any of these CAA-NPR-NRC. They will just change the timeline for NRC which I had known before the CAA was even announced as their preferred timeline for the same is 2023-2029. Amit Shah was just trying to test the waters and making an attempt to bulldoze the NRC. I worked alongside Prashant Kishor in 2013-2014 for the BJP and then as an independent consultant directly with the BJP for Assam elections in 2016.

"We need to extend support and solidarity to minorities and marginalized sections of society rather than vilify them if we want them to keep coming forward to report coronavirus symptoms We have all seen how Muslims are being vilified after [a Muslim congregation](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-52147260) sparked a new wave of COVID-19 cases. 
[List of names with addresses and mobile phone numbers](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/covid-19-activists-voice-privacy-concerns-over-leak-of-unverified-patients-list-on-social-media/article31236944.ece) of people who attended the Tablighi Jamaat event in Delhi are circulating on social media. Given the communal narrative being spread against them, this makes them extremely vulnerable to community backlash and hate crime.

A BJP Health Minister himself [revealed the names, age and locality of Nizamuddin returnees](https://swarajyamag.com/politics/this-is-why-the-names-of-the-nizamuddin-returnees-who-tested-covid-19-positive-in-assam-were-revealed) who tested positive in his state in an official press conference. He then asked the other Jamaat attendees to also come forward to face the same ""treatment"". Any guesses how many would willingly come forward now?

In most other parts of India, so far the administration [has made efforts](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/those-revealing-identity-of-covid-19-patients-to-face-action/articleshow/74590731.cms) to preserve patients anonymity, but I guess these rules can be bent if there are ""special circumstances"".

Yes, you could make an argument that other people need to know who they are so that they can stay away from them, but that can be easily achieved by using [hand stamps](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/03/privacy-fears-india-hand-stamps-suspected-coronavirus-cases-200320120033460.html) or [""Home Under Quarantine"" stickers](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/kerala-covid-19-stickers-being-stamped-on-houses-of-home-quarantined-families-1660543-2020-03-28), though IMO even these methods should be employed only on willful violators. But at least with these methods, only your immediate neighbors will know rather than the entire city/nation and any potential backlash will be minimized.

Charging people with the draconian National Security Act (which allows detention without charges or trial for up to a year) is also counterproductive, while that will definitely make violent people think twice before assaulting health workers, ordinary Muslims in UP, who are already deeply distrustful of the Yogi government, will now be even less forthcoming about their symptoms to health workers. 

Similarly, by now we have all heard of [how 5000 migrant workers were sprayed with bleach](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/30/india/india-migrant-workers-sprayed-intl/index.html) to ""disninfect"" them.

"Free Media Media constitute the fourth pillar of democracy.

In words of Benito Mussolini –

“Democracy is a kingless regime infested by many kings who are sometimes more exclusive, tyrannical and destructive than one, if he be a tyrant. It is the fear of being exposed by the media before the public that most of the politicians keep themselves under control to some extent""

If media is honest and committed in its job, democracy is bound to function more efficiently and the loopholes present in any democratic system can certainly be plugged to the fullest satisfaction of the people. On the contrary, if media is biased, corrupt and favours only a particular party or few individuals, it can prove to be very dangerous for the smooth functioning of democracy.

"My recent experience with a NEXA dealership. TLDR: Don’t take the word of a car dealership/service station at its face value. Do your due diligence, ask around  before committing to any off the schedule repair/maintenance. 

So about 3 weeks back, I borrowed a near new condition Ignis (about 2.5 year old and less than 15k kms) from a cousin and drove to about 130kms to a town nearby for some urgent family matter. 

15 mins into the drive, the steering felt a bit strange and I stopped over to check. Upon inspection of the tires and the engine bay, everything seemed ok. But thought I’d get the wheels balanced and aligned once I reach my destination. So I refilled the tires with correct air pressure (which was off a bit) and went on my way.

Drive to the destination was fine and mostly highway driving. Upon reaching my destination I noticed that the car’s front tire assembly would make a funny sound on sharp turnings, as I was parking it. Opened up the hood and saw a lot of grease/oil smeared near the passenger cv shaft ( the rod that connects the engine to the tire and drives it). I immediately knew that the CV boot ( rubber cover around a bearing) had busted and had spilled all its grease. 

But just to be sure and since this was not my car, I took it straight to the Nexa showroom, while I also calling the owner of the car. The Nexa showroom people pointed me to the their service station, which thankfully wasn’t that far. Nobody at the showroom bothered to come see the car and see if it was even drivable (or safe to drive). But I can understand since this was just a sales showroom.

Upon reaching the service centre the foreman inspects the car and says that the whole cv shaft is broken and would need a replacement. I asked if he was 100% sure and asked to see the owner for confirmation. The owner repeats the same and they quote me Rs 7000 (plus labour) for the fix and ask me to leave the car there for a few days as they would need to order the part. I asked them to provide me with a inspection/quotation paper. Which they did. I then tell them that according to my experience and knowledge only the cv boot needs replacement. They totally dismissed my input. By this time I had already removed the car from their service station and parked it outside. 

I then call my cousin and explain the whole situation in front of the service station owner and the foreman. I tell him what the Nexa service people think was the problem and the price and time associated with the fix. He then asks me what my opinion was, and I tell him that that the CV shaft in my opinion was ok and only the boot/rubber cover needs replacement and refilling with grease. Since the wheel still had power and the CV shaft was intact in one piece, and the reason for the sound was no/low grease around the cv bearing. I tell him that I knew that the CV shaft was fine and only the boot/rubber covering was broken since about 4 years ago I had personally replaced the whole CV shaft on my own car (common issue on older cars) and know about these issues.

After hearing this, the owner leaves and the foreman asks me to sign the quotation/service form which now states that they couldn’t repair the car because of “unavailability of part”. 

After that, I go to a car repair market nearby and consult with the mechanic there. Who confirms my diagnosis. And after confirming with my cousins, he fixes it within 1.5 hours for a total of Rs 700. The car drives fine, no problems since. 

Knowing that this was not my car, I would have happily paid more that Rs 700 if Nexa service people were willing to replace the cv boot. Maybe just maybe they don’t replace the cv boot, period. But at least they could have been honest with me and not miss diagnosed the issue. I never trusted car dealerships and their service stations, this just added to the list.",Scheduled

"RANT : Some people need to be thrown into prison for spreading so much of venomous hatred and misinformation that fuels communal tensions. As you all know, the Delhi riots which happened a month back saw many deaths and it acts as a symbol of the divide in our country.

This divide will only further deepen if we allow the endless flow of misinformation and fake news through whatsapp and other social media sites.

With the coronavirus further slowing down an already relatively slow economy and increasing an already high unemployment rate, such misinformation will definitely cause more riots (or worse, a civil war).

The ones who will be affected the most by this are the poor. During the Delhi riots, most of the people who died and suffered were either poor or of the lower middle class and the ones who are suffering now due to the virus are also the poor. They will only further suffer if such misinformation that causes communal tensions are spread.

To the people who have read this post till now, if you see anybody in WhatsApp or any other social media site posting any misinformation or fake news, I implore you to call them out for spreading such misinformation and tell them that it is ILLEGAL AND PUNISHABLE if they further do so. Whether you are respectful to them or not is at your own discretion. If they still don't stop then report them to the concerned authority.

"Will the conflict between India and Pakistan ever come to an end? Will peace ever prevail between these two countries?

Since 1947, both countries have been fighting with each other over the issues like kashmir and have fought 4 bloody wars with each other wasting billions of dollars fighting with each other while the people in both countries are suffering because of poverty.

It only seems to getting worse whether it be some terrorist attacks from Pakistan or the stupid kashmir move done by the BJP govt. and increasing the unrest in that place.

Religious extremism is destroying both countries. Both countries seem to be obsessed with religion rather than prosperity and progress.

Imagine if both countries actually focused on development and progress rather than thinking of destroying each other.

Combined population of both the countries is about 1.6 Billion(160 crores) which is about one-fifth or 20% of human population. However more than a quarter of this population is illitrate and both of these countries are very backward when it comes to education, science and technology progress.

Imagine if both of these countries focused on investing in education, healthcare, building economic infrastructure, empowerment of women, increasing literacy rates to 100%, improved their education systems, focusing on economic development, building scientific among the population through proper education rather than fighting over Kashmir out of which nothing was gained, it only lead to deaths of thousands of soldiers of both countries and the suffering of people in Kashmir.

It would be so better if this one-fifth population also contributed to progress of humanity and utilized it's potential.

"So I am writing a book, titled ironically ""Letters from your BFF"" in response to Nikita Singh's ""Letters to my ex"". Hey everyone, I have flaired the post AskIndia, because I am seeking a conversation about absurdities of relationships and interpersonal friendships in today's world. 

Would love to hear from you guys. My notes on the original book are given below. Looking forward to your comments and suggestions and experiences and anything else you feel like talking about based on the summary/notes of the book I have provided below...

-------

""Letters To My Ex"" is a book by Nikita Singh, about a girl who runs away from her own engagement ceremony. She was supposed to be engaged and married to her own long time boyfriend but yet, she just freaked out and run away. She does not talk to anyone after that, and ten months in, she confesses to the boyfriend that she still loves him and makes him swear that he will do everything to earn her trust everyday henceforth.

I think it is a slightly less intellectual equivalent of ""Notes From The Underground"" (Men are Not Piano Keys) fame. The format is the same. Notes from the underground has notes, letters has letters. They are both viciously funny and about characters that are absolutely abominable.

Anyways, I started out writing my own response to the girl from the book and plan to publish it as a book of my own introducing concepts from neuroscience and philosophy and conflict resolution and the likes.

The original book is located here:

-----------------------------

These are my notes:

# On the Book

This books is about two people who met in college, were going to be married, but the woman ran away from the middle of the engagement ceremony and then they are again engaged.

As the author states, something essential connects them. This is very easy. They are connected by deformed ideas of love and a shared identity that they could not shed.

She panics because she does not discuss her problems and her idea of her future melts away right in front of her. And thereafter she does arbitrary things, does not communicate to anyone and when she meets her boyfriend and takes a look at him having moved on she falls in love with him again. And even he falls in love with her, again, because that desire motivates. And then he is self absorbed in his own way about her. And the girlfriend has no control over him. 

# January 
There's a lot of talk about the reactions she gets when she breaks off the marriage. Dad is confused, mom is angry and both of them are disappointed. Which brings in the next point. She is really, really confused at how she ended up being the disappointing one because she is not the one that disappoints, ever. Because she always behaved like the perfect daughter. And who is the perfect daughter? She does not know, she has an image in mind and she maintains it.

Then we get to see her first meet. What we realize is that she is reads a lot and she did not have time for appearances. She is a thinker. But she thinks a lot. Really. But does not have an internal discipline of truth maintenance. She falls in love with a legend. He is a cricketer. She has heard of him, and he cannot be controlled, can not be tamed, so she gets insecure around him and does not know how to behave. And she tries and dominate him, ""Do you like being ignored?""  Rolls her eyes!

And then there is the scene in which she breaks off her engagement. She runs away in the middle of it all because stress has been building up. And there after, she just starts thinking and feeling sad and keeping her thoughts to herself and being disappointed by life in general. She thinks that this is all turning out to be like other unhappy, sad, emotionless, married couples. And so the idea just freaks her out. And so she does not control and run away. Even in the middle of it, she wants him to come back to her, and run to save her. She is running away, but instead of thinking what she has done to him, she really wants him to come get her back. So. How. How in the world is it possible?

# February 
From a lot of the discussion it is somewhat apparent that she resented the involvement of her family into her life. There is some psychological projection involved as well. Their families are trying to conduct the affairs the way that they know is best. But after all this involvement, Needhi realizes this is not what she had in her mind. Which is to say, she had an idyllic vision of marriage in her head and the world just did not figure into that. So when that image broke, she did not understand what to do about it. The more the image changed, the sadder she got. None of this, she talked with anyone else.  


There is the theme of their careers too. Abhay joined the family business while Needhi did not know what to do with her life. Both are probably liberal arts students, but this is what attracted them to each other - their differences. Abhay is a cricketer and then works with family business. So both require team work while Needhi is a more independent person. This is the kind of person who would do something innovative when she grows up. The problem with Needhi is that she does not grow up. Even Abhay has a few problems to deal with, but since all he has to do is follow the rules it never becomes apparent that he is also immature. Now, major points are that Abhay is self assured and traditional, teamplayer while Needhi is open to new experiences, independent and a thoughtful person of a more gentle demeanour.


Yes, there it is. She has existential problems in life. Who am I? Why am I here? What am I doing? What is my purpose in life? What will bring me happiness? All good questions to ask, and answer, this is a worthy pursuit. Here, she is incompetent. That is the problem. She says she wants a weaker memory and that she wants to be less of a control freak. That is, she remembers every little thing without being able to let go, and even control is also an inability to let go. She has no concept of where her independence ends and where the world begins. She even blames Abhay for not loving her enough or stopping to love him, and this is after she breaks the engagement. So the problem that led to the freaking out at the engagement is being discussed two months after the engagement and it was someone else's fault. In fact, she blames it on him that he did not try to stop her when she was running away even though she wanted him to stop her and this is further proof that he had stopped loving her and she was angry when she was running away that she was not stopping her.

# March

This is where Abhay eMails her. And within this email we get to know one thing, she never picks up his calls. She does accept that this is cowardice, but this needs to be explored. Why does she not pick up calls? Why does she not respond to texts? Why does she respond to him now? This is probably because he was confrontational and formal and he asked her point blank. Why did she do what she did? And then she responds to him. Maybe partially because she loves him and that she never saw him this way. But she responds to him that there was a loss of feeling and that she was a coward not to return calls or texts. And that is there. So. Once the self absorbed image breaks down she starts to feel a distance. This would be repaired only through creative engagement with stress.

She has wrecked her brains but has no answer to his questions: why did she do it. However, Abhay talks about something that hints at her avoidance. She avoids calls. She avoids confrontation. She avoids meeting with Abhay when he is with some other girl and then she avoids getting into engagement. Needhi avoids everything. Needhi has a void inside her after all this avoiding.

Needhi has no answers regarding anything, but Abhay has a very concrete event that precipitated a change in the feelings: when Anamika kissed Abhay and he did not stop. Again, this hints at his lack of self regulation. There are two components: the meaning of the event and the pleasure of the event. Both are controlled by different subsytems in the brain. And this meant that he would not stop the kiss and go with the flow. This created dissonance in her head and wrecked everything apart. They decide to meet, why is that so? This is probably because they had a heart to heart and treated each other with their intimate thoughts so something built up. 

# April
The first thing that jumps out at us is how he just avoids all kind of conversation about the topics that matter. She just does not talk about things that matter to her, to the point that Abhay has to say that he will not accept that ""I don't know"" answer. So all this stupidity for three months? Just so that she could avoid facing uncomfortable situations. In the end she faced an uncomfortable situation because something in her was awakened by a conversation with Abhay. They talked. They talked about what was bothering them and so a little bit of love happened.

She talks about things that make her uncomfortable and gets very emotional, but absolutely refuses to discuss things, because she says there is no point. What she does not realize is that there has to be a point, of answering the question, ""Where do we go from here""? So she keeps ruminating, discussing and talking the same things again and again but she does not know what to do with the discussion. She does not have basic conflict resolution skills. All of this is just her feelings, but she herself does not know what to do with the feelings. 

After having two discussions, one in March and the other in April, about things that she did, she feels a little better. This is because things have moved further and Abhay has discussed and imposed his constraints. Needhi did not accept even to herself that Anamika's kiss had affected her. Which is why this was buried deep down in her psyche and the memories came back later when it was discussed. This is one of those things, she feels that if she does not talk about things then they will go away.

# May
May is her Tinder month. Here she meets three people. The first one is someone who genuinely cares for her, sees her confused and intimidated and guides her through the process. The only mistake he makes is that he does not ask her, but just goes on telling her about what he genuinely thinks is helpful. She feels he is imposing himself on her. And so she does not like it. Then she is surprised that he enjoyed himself and had a good time with her. She ghosts him.

Then there is the MNC guy who is really high up. She is really fascinated by all the work that he does and she really enjoys all the discussion. Now this could have been her ticket up, but even here she makes the mistake that she is doing nothing. She just talks about things, not about herself. This is ofcourse, the same mistake that every one makes, which is the presentation of an image to another person who is presenting an image while you have all these thoughts. All she had to say is, oh god this is so exciting and then all hell would have broken lose.

Then there is Dhruv. Perfect guy again. Does everything. Even stops calling her when she tells him not to. He is perfect in every way but she does not feel the spark. And how is one supposed to feel the spark. Talk! Dhruv, you are such a wonderful person. Oh my God. This is so amazing. Haha! And then he says something. And she talks about her own marriage. And he comforts her and they lean in. And that's that. 

# June
They have a chat in June where they start discussing some things and behave as if things are normal, or near normal. Abhay is chatting with her simply because there is a wedding coming up and he will be there with a girlfriend. Needhi takes the opportunity to give him a chance to have a conversation with her about her life. Now, the two of them have an understanding here that if one talks about her problems, she will simply not have to worry about coming across as weak. In fact that is a signal to come closer. She calls it breaking the ice. She could do the same with other people, but she does not.

She is talking about her coworkers, but she is fairly self obsessed. She has no ability to talk to other people and presents her interpretation of events rather than talk about actual facts.

There is all this talk about awkwardness, which basically makes me think, what the hell? Where is the maturity? Talk about the elephant in the room.

#July 
The one thing that stands out in all of this is Needhi's need not to have awkwardness. Awkwardness is assuming some convention, adhering to it, needing to maintain that and pretending nothing happens outside of that script. For all of Needhi's talk of her famillies adhering to some script, even this one is adherence to a script. Just the one that she chooses. She feels awkwardness, she has to be non chalant yet friendly and still not have to overcompensate. She just can not feel easy, until alcohol comes and solves the problem. Bekhuudi. A disinhibited state. Jaam ki zaroorat, hai jaise, bekhoodi ke liyey, bas ek sanam chahiyey, aashiqui ke liyey!

Needhi's friend confronts her about this and they have a conversation on whether they have really moved on or not. And then, she pushes and pulls. Slowly. She says they have moved on, then maybe they are pretending to have moved on. There is this issue, of imposing an image and pretending that things are a certain way when they themselves don't know how things already are!

Then finally it happens. They both see each other in their prime. Abhay is non challant about everything, because, of course, he has a girlfriend. Needhi becomes vulnerable, partly because she is already in a weakned state because her identity has been broken while Abhay is already there. So she is hungry and in awe of Abhay. And there he is. Non challant! As she says. And so she is weak and beautiful. Abhay takes a look at her and his primal love is reactivated. And she thinks this is love, which partially it is.

# August
She has a mix of depression, anxiety and fever by now. She thinks she was moving on, but then again, she does not move on. The body is different from her self image.  She says she wants to do something, but the body just does not respond. Of course it won't. This is textbook creative stress. Change will not happen in such a manner. And that is the point, she has to confront everything. And had Abhay never really gotten back to her, she would have had to move on and deal with everything, but no, that is not how it happens.

Abhay talks about being distant from his girlfriend. What is going on is that his mind has been occupied by Needhi. Simran is automatically put in the backseat. He keeps on blabbering about how he gave all of him to her but that was not enough, and that introduces us to a new concept. What do you mean giving it his all? So, that is one thing.

She felt better when she had run away, temporarily. But now she is devastated. There she had to confront the fact that life would not be like she imagined it to be so she freaked out. Now she has to confront the fact that she still loves Abhay and she does not have him in her life and so she freaks out again. And this time it is major, because she has to do something. But then, she gets it all without doing anything. She is basically a slave to her feelings. Later on we find out that what she just blurts out everything to him. That is all that she does.

# September
She is reminiscing about their times together. Needhi freaks out always because she has no endgame in mind and when Abhay scolds her or tutors her or lectures her she gets defensive. But the point is that she is reminiscing. All the good memories are coming back.

She admits that they never had any such problems at the time. Why? Because they had nothing to do, really. All they had to do was be in love and enjoy the feeling and keep performing the same identity.

The one thing that I keep missing out on here is that she is doing really badly in her career too. She does not have her shit together. This is form an existential standpoint and also the fact that she has no identity to work from. This is precisely what ego does, it does not settle, it does not sacrifice. It does not know what to do.

# October
She finally gives in. First there is the rumination. She finds a hundred reasons for them not to be together and then she finds a hundred reasons for them to be together.

Trust comes up over and over again. They have trust issues, yes, of course they will have because they are both unable to deal with anything, they have no binding reality and they act on their whims. 

Even though she has been making Abhay dance all over her tune, she blames him for kissing Anamika and precipitating this. She takes no note of the fact that she did not want to deal with it and suppressed the memory.

# November
Abhay is clearly still in love with her, but he is also torn apart. He is completely broken. She just left without an explanation, on a whim without doing anything really to be responsible towards Abhay. So he wants her but he tells her that he cannot trust her and she has to have made a good decision that she is fully in. They do not know what a decision is.

Abhay is made to feel guilty and he is already being manipulated by her unknowingly because he is making the promise that he is going to wake up every day trying to gain her trust. So now we know that they do not have any idea on how trust emerges either. The more important part is that Needhi has a very bad effect on Abhay and the children do not discuss this with their parents or other responsible adults.

Their idea of moving past trauma is to forget it, which is really bad. Cheating and abandoning. Well. What the fuck. Really. Also, I promise to be yours if you promise to be mine. Mine and yours. Also. What the fuck. Conditional love. It's not conditional, it's a contract.

# December
She feels 19 again.

They have a set of promises one is about playing devil's advocate.

They are marrying, but then since they have not had any commitments here, no concept and no growth what is going on is that they will break up again, brutally. And that is why this is a viciously funny book if you know what the fuck is going on. She breaks up with him and then tells him to marry him again and now they are going to marry each other without changing anything. So what happened, really? Nothing! This almost reads like an episode of Sillicon Valley.

"Some serious questions regarding 'groping in public' Few day back, one of my friends got groped in a public transport while on her way back home from work. When she told me about the incident, I felt so bad that I don't even have a word to describe it. That situation badly affected her mental health and she questioned me what could she have done to stop what happened with her? What if it happens again? And even, should women carry guns?(she is not a violent person, it was just her angst and fear talking) 

I googled about this groping in public thing and turns out that it is very common in India, and some other countries too! But my google searches did not yield me any helpful information about this social issue that almost every woman in our country faces. So I'm here to ask those questions.

1. How can a woman prevent and defend this? What precautions should she take? 

2. What should she do right away as well as after this happens? 

3. Best self defence methods in these situations? (Like pepper spray)

4. Any group or commission that help in such cases? 

5. How does our police act on cases like this?

The ads are made in a way, it looks like that condoms are sex enhancers. They give more pleasure. Where the opposite is true. Also that's not the purpose of the condom anyway.

Condoms are not sexy. Condom ads should not be sexy either.

"So my abusive dad just pulled out a knife in a heated argument. Is this OK? Possible trigger warning I guess. 

This is not fiction. This just happened and I'm fucking shaking. I'm not a troll. I'm 17 years old(boy). I posted here a couple of hours ago showing the video footage that I was able to take during the scene. My question is- is this ok? If I had continued recording and didn't put my phone away, he probably would've stabbed me. After that I ran off to the bathroom, and he pushed the door multiple times. I was fucking shaking and managed to called my mother and she came thankfully. Now I could write pages about how my father has abused me since my childhood, but I'm really looking for some advice to what to do from the older, wiser people of reddit who have been through abuse. I have discussed with my mother and will be moving in with her in another city where she lives with her aunt and uncle. We already booked the tickets on redbus. We discussed this for a long hour. Now, in short my father is very controlling and abusive towards anyone who disobeys his every order. Several times over my entire childhood, he has had outbursts at night, beating and threatening to kill my mother and tonight me. So yeah, I'm really anxious while typing this. It's 1:30 am right now and I'm packing. We have a bus tomorrow at night but I am afraid he might do something in the mean time. My mother, who has suffered the same things when we were little says it's best to just ignore him. But today he just pulled out a knife and I was scared for my life. How long should we just ignore criminals? How long until something like this happens. Please I want some realistic advice here. I've been ignoring him for a long time now, I think this time something definitely needs to be done. 

Edit:

PS: More specifically he pulled out two knives and asked me to fight him. I put it down immediately. I was also recording at the time as nowadays whenever he gets in a bad mood and starts looking for me I start to record. I put away the phone coz I was terrified for my life. I couldn't record much after that. I managed to get the record up here(check post history) while I was hiding in the bathroom.

My mother has told me it is my fault repeatedly. I get how I might have provoked him a little, but I literally never talk to the guy, he is always the one who starts all this, including this one. I generally close the door when he's home for obvious reasons. This time he came into the room and shouted something and opened the door. I wanted to keep the door closed. I told him a bit annoyingly and that started everything basically. I actually have more recordings with me. 

And yes, some of you may think I'm exaggerating, or I'm only telling my side of the story. Check out the video in my post history that I uploaded from the bathroom(and after that I managed to call my mother and she came immediately). I am trying to give the fairest view on this as I can.

If you have any questions, please ask.

Edit: I hid the video sorry.

Edit 2: unhidded

"Something to reflect on during ongoing protests. With the ongoing protests over the CAA and the NRC/NPR going on across the country which has united and electrified the country there will be outsiders as well Indians within the country that would be wondering why there hasn't been a similar level of outrage about the massive amount of child deaths or the deaths of innocent labourers in factory fires or the continuing spate of rapes in the country. The very thought of child dying in the hospital should spark a strong reaction from us but there has not been the kind of outrage that this issue deserves.

This is something  that needs to be reflected on. Recently Hasan Minhaj called this compassion fatigue, ( Caring about every issue all the time). There are way too many issues in the country that need to need a voice and need to be fought and changed.But it's difficult to protest about everything all the time. This populist sentiment is reflected in the print and visual media as well, the news of the children dying should be blockbuster front page news but it has only got a small snippet on the major newspapers and the CAA Protests have taken precedence. 

The shelf life of the issues have a short life in the media and a short attention span among the people. I’m trying to say that we should strike a balance, at all the CAA Protests the people should say that they want a better nation with better hospitals, better working conditions , basic safety and security for women and they will keep protesting until they get it. By doing this we can ensure that these issues are still voiced and are in the public and media eye.",CAA-NRC-NPR

When the leaders of the nation are such clueless morons, what do we expect from the people of the country who follow such leaders? No wonder lakhs of them ended up on the streets instead of sitting at home and maintaining curfew 

BJP fanatics still claim that Modi raised awareness about Coronavirus. What Modi really did was expose lakhs of people to the virus during 5 minutes of stupidity. Literally whole day's effort got wasted because Modi living in his sab changa sii bubble still doesn't understand the common man of the country. He could have avoided the drama but that wouldn't fulfill his massive ego. 

His silly chest-thumping message put lakhs of people directly at risk of being exposed to the virus.

"The problem with current CAA protests - from a right wingers perspective Note: The post is based on the fundamental premise that India needs to meet these objectives,

a. Secure borders and eliminate any illegal immigration 

b. Deport any illegal immigrants 

If you do not agree to these points, viz. you strongly believe in open borders, we cant have any meaningful discussion - and just agree to disagree. 

Post: The current problems with the CAA protests as I perceive them,

1. Blanket refusal stating 'kagaz nahi dikhayenge' - this is not a great stratgey. Rather, there should be solid proposals from them on how to meet the objectives stated above. If NPR and CAA are unacceptable, what should be alternate methods to achieve these objectives? 

2. Citizenship extension to all illegal immigrants except muslims - this obviously is the crux of the matter, because this aspect clearly discriminates between ilegal immigrants based on their religion. The question then becomes, are anti CAA protestors, protesting on the behalf of Hazaras, Ahmadis and Rohingyas? If so, India already has a system in place to naturalize persecuted minorities so I dont understand why this is such a contentious issue. 

As I see it, albeit with all my biases, the protests  are a boiling over of the suppressed anger against 370, Babri, triple talaq and the soon to be uniform civil code. Also center/left leadership are inciting fear of minority deportation, for political gains. 

Tl;dr - rather than seemingly directionless and rigid protests, anti CAA movement should come up with alternate(s) on a better way to achieve anti--illegal immigration objectives.

*** 

Seeing that the thread has crossed a 100 comments, now is as good a time as any to summarize things and give a final perspective from my pov,

1. While there was a great deal of participation and discussion, it mostly centered around why the CAA+NRC must be repealed as a whole, without any real, better alternative that could meet the objectives 

2. It was clear that there is a great deal of fear and anger over the suspicion that legal muslim citizens will be deported enmasse, but as to what evidence this sentiment is based on was quite unclear 

3. There were also multiple occasions when participants wanted to challenge the premise of stricter immigration laws and whether they are even a truly pressing issue - to this all I want to say on this point is that while there are economic arguments on both sides, this is also an emotive issue for RW folks like me, it is not necessary that it make a strong economic case (which I strongly feel it does). Whether you choose to agree or disagree, it is important that we understand each other on this, personal attacks online or now as we are seeing in the real world, will only dilute and belittle the anti CAA stance. 

If nothing else, this thread helped me better empathize with those of the opposing view, at least their fears and motivations.

Waldo Emerson once said that bad times have scientific values, and I can’t recall who quoted that no matter how bad it is, it can always be worse.

Some jumping ship, some hanging around fighting for the cause; begging, borrowing, appropriating, somehow, you do everything to never let doubts creep into your mind. 

Some nights are spent, staring at a blank screen, unresponsive code, a sad prototype of the dream that you chase.

Some days are spent, evaluating yourself, if the sum total of your life was a failure that was staring you in the face each day, each night. Your self-worth becomes zero, you become completely undesirable to people who probably loved you once, you have already jerked off to all the porn that you could handle.

By this time, all your friends have become your creditors, with lines of credits exhausted, you scroll your contact list constantly to find that one person, not to seek funds, but to talk with.
We try to hark back for simpler times, reminiscence the moments that made us laugh, then, but we hope probably it would bring an honest smile to our face – our smiles that we had pawned off we did not know when, to users, downloads, sessions and GMVs.

Then one day, you come home, stare at the blank screen, try to make sense of things, break down, and just before letting go of everything seems like an option.

To further (mis)quote Hemingway, sometimes our actions are not immediately discernible and when we try for something beyond attainment, something that has never been done, and things that others have tried and failed, and perhaps with ‘karma’ you will succeed.

I understand when a new govt comes to power it appoints its own people to the govt offices. When UPA came to power in 2004, it replaced most of the state governers with its own sympathizers. Now that BJP has come to power, it did the same thing except Mr. Najib Jung. **Fair enough and pretty much consistent**

But one thing I don't get is why is BJP appointing unqualified people in the institutions of national importance? How does it serve any purpose? Isn't it against the very philosophy of Make In India? If you want India to develop, you need to have qualified guardians at the institutions of national importance.

I understand that India academia is highly influences by leftist ideology which I personally despise. I'm libertarian & pro-capitalism when it comes to economic ideology. 

BJP is Far Right Wing which has pro-capitalism as economic philosophy at its core. But how do recent appointments justify it? If right wing is about market capitalism, should not BJP give more autonomy to these institutions, instead of screwing up their reputation with high-handed appointments.

I understand top brass of BJP/RSS feel that curricula of Indian education system is against Indian culture/traditions. They also feel that history subject is biased. But if they want to change it, shouldn't they do it at the school level. 

Anyway institutions like IIT/TIFR/IISSc/IIMs are mostly about science, technology & technology. So, why messing with them?

India already doesn't have any Univ in the top 300 ranking of QS world ranking. With recent high-handed appointments, I'm sure their quality will take a nosedive.

This is pretty much my thoughts. Let us please discuss it. I would request people not to take sides. Please be objective in your analysis based on logic. It's not about BJP/Congress/AAP. It's about me and your future.

"The true purpose of reservations in India is not economic upliftment, but social inclusion.  ***For the record, I am a Brahmin (I don't see myself as one. It is merely the word that I use when I fill out any Government form that asks me the question) and I have, in no way, benefited from reservations or affirmative action.***

Reservations in India is a fraught topic and tends to divide people like no other topic does. The vast majority of the upper castes blame reservations for India's inefficient Governance and subsequent lack of opportunities. Many others think it is meant to provide economic upliftment to the so-called depressed classes who have been at the receiving end of the caste pyramid for centuries. Others describe it as a necessary evil that does more good than harm. I take objection to this description of reservation as a ""*necessary evil*"" and as a means of economic upliftment. It is not evil and it is necessary. It does not seek to economically uplift the depressed classes. I will now demonstrate why.

Reservations for the depressed classes (scheduled castes or scheduled tribes and so on and so forth) have been a feature of politics, education and employment opportunities in Independent India. The policy aims to reserve a portion of seats in educational institutions, employment opportunities in Government run organisations and in electoral constituencies for those candidates who are identified to be part of the above mentioned communities. These communities have historically been marginalised and have been downtrodden for millennia. In the case of the Scheduled Tribes (or STs), their predilection to residing in the forests and the remote hinterlands of the Indian sub continent has ensured that they remained outside the purview of mainstream society and thus bereft of the opportunities that are provided by being part of the villages and cities and so on. The tribes of India are for the most part, hunter gatherers living in the remote jungle (such as the Bhils, Gonds and Santhals), or nomadic herders in nature, living with their livestock and migrating from one place to another in search of pasture (such as the Gujjars in some states, though their status as an ST is debatable). Many of these tribes lived only on the margins of human settlements in India and were viewed with hostility and suspicion by most people. The British criminalised many of them by instituting an act called the Criminal Tribes act. Entire communities were criminalised and those who were on the margins of society were further outcast. These communities neither had a say nor were given any kind of justice when their resources (such as forest produce, or land that has historically belonged to them) were extracted (or plundered, if you think that way) by the Government of India in the name of the People of India. Their woman and children have been exploited when they venture out of their remote domains. They have forever been on the margins of society, physically and socially, and have had no voice in the debates of modern India, a country that now counts them as its citizens.

The Scheduled Castes (or SCs) have been treated worse. These communities were classified as social outcasts and were often forced to live outside the village. They weren't allowed to draw water from the same well as the rest of the village, they weren't allowed to visit the temple or take part in the communal activities such as festivals or decision making. They provided an important source of agricultural labour in villages (and still do) and performed menial jobs in the cities that were ritually considered impure or dirty. The agricultural economy would collapse if their labour was not available and sanitation would have been non-existent in the cities without the *Dalits* to clean the toilets and clear the corpses. And yet, they were not part of the conversation when it came to society. They have never had a voice, a say in the decisions that are made when the community gets together and makes a collective decision. They have been exploited physically, economically, and socially by all and sundry. Their status has been little better than slaves. They are an important part of Indian society but have little to no say in the affairs of the country or the state, and yet they are counted as citizens of India.

Why am I telling you so much about how these communities have been excluded over thousands of years? Because reservation is not a policy that primarily seeks to economically uplift communities and give them education and jobs. The purpose of reservation is not economic upliftment but ***social inclusion*** within the mainstream of society, in effect giving them a say in governance and a voice in society. Reservation aims to bring these communities into the social mainstream so that they become part of the conversation and are able to participate fully in society (In politics, in our educational institutions, in employment, in decision making capacities and so on). Without affirmative action policies such as reservation, these communities will forever be marginalised on the outskirts of society. They will be denied a voice and denied opportunities to advance, and denied the right to be treated with dignity as Humans. The harm done to these communities by centuries of prejudice has hardly begun to be redressed by the policies of Independent India. 

It is highly unfortunate that the original purpose of reservation has been warped in such a manner that all and sundry (I am looking at the OBCs and those who advocate reservations for economically weaker sections among the upper castes now) are demanding reservations. Reservation is not about economic opportunity. It is about social justice, and economic opportunity is a by product of social opportunity. Until such a time arrives when these communities are afforded the same social opportunities as the rest of society and are not excluded, reservations are a necessity in India. It is ***not*** a necessary evil. It is ***not*** an evil at all. It is justice.",Scheduled
